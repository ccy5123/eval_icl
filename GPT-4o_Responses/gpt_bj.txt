To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents tend to have property values around 2.5 to 3.5, depending on additional functional groups and structural complexity. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 3.6035674514745475, and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a value of 3.1716780304409156. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromaticity generally increases the property value.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a single chlorine atom and an aromatic heterocyclic structure, which is less complex than some of the higher-valued examples but more complex than simpler chlorinated compounds like ClCC, which has a value of 1.6329931618554523.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 3.0, as it balances the influence of the aromatic ring, the heterocyclic structure, and the single chlorine atom. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as logP (partition coefficient), which is influenced by the size, shape, and functional groups of the molecule.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. It is similar in structure to the first example, Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a property value of 2.5458785187157504. However, biphenyl is less complex, having only two phenyl rings without additional substituents or fused rings.

Considering the examples provided, simpler aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have property values around 2.0 to 3.0. Given that biphenyl is a straightforward structure with two phenyl rings, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around the midpoint of this range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is approximately 2.5.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 2.19060968716425
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like hydrophobicity or logP (partition coefficient), which is often influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to linear alkanes, which tend to have moderate property values in the given examples. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCC (a seven-carbon alkane) has a property value of 2.663883887398184, and CCCCCCC(C)O (a similar structure with an additional hydroxyl group) has a value of 2.7731888559274704.

Given that CCCCCS is a five-carbon chain with a sulfur atom, we can expect its property value to be slightly lower than that of longer alkanes but potentially higher than shorter ones due to the presence of sulfur, which can increase the property value slightly compared to a simple alkane.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 2.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, branching, and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a total of 7 carbon atoms and an alcohol functional group. Let's compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (3.168489872670569) - This is a branched alkane with 6 carbon atoms.
2. CC(C)CC(C)O (2.9532231745612925) - This is a branched alcohol with 6 carbon atoms.

The presence of the alcohol group in CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CC(C)CC(C)O, which has a property value of 2.9532231745612925. The additional carbon in CCCC(C)(C)CO compared to CC(C)CC(C)O suggests a slightly higher property value due to the increased size and branching.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be slightly higher than 2.9532231745612925. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately:

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic rings, such as benzene, tend to have property values around 2.0 to 3.0. The presence of halogens, like chlorine or bromine, generally increases the property value, as seen in examples like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (3.032) and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (3.032).

The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and can significantly affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with multiple halogens or electronegative groups tend to have higher property values, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (2.716) and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (3.195).

Considering these factors, the trifluoromethyl group is likely to increase the property value compared to a simple benzene ring. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be slightly higher than that of a simple benzene derivative, likely around 3.0.

True Property: 3.7407578946726843
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with relatively high property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is an electron-withdrawing group and can influence the property value.
- An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but can affect the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often above 3.0. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group might further increase the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 3.1.

True Property: 2.8141442217770303
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the examples, we have several esters and similar functional groups:

1. CC(C)CCOC=O (2.814002148389726) - This is an ester with a similar structure, but with a longer carbon chain.
2. CCC(C)(C)O (3.168489872670569) - This is a tertiary alcohol, which is structurally different but provides some insight into the effect of branching.
3. CCCC=O (2.4017152226171965) - This is a ketone, which is structurally different but provides insight into the effect of a carbonyl group.

Considering the examples, the presence of the ester functional group and the branching in the isopropyl group, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be slightly lower than that of CC(C)CCOC=O due to the shorter carbon chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around 2.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a derivative of phenol with two methyl groups. In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds with various substituents, and their property values range from around 1.95 to 3.57. The presence of hydroxyl groups and methyl groups generally increases the property value compared to unsubstituted benzene.

Considering the examples, the molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 3.0214653097240864. The addition of methyl groups, which are electron-donating, might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 3.1.

The molecule also contains an aromatic ring with substituents: a methoxy group (OC), a thiomethyl group (SC), and a methyl group (C). The presence of these groups suggests a similarity to the examples with aromatic rings and various substituents, which tend to have property values around 3.0 to 3.2.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be close to the values of the similar phosphorothioate-containing examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 3.0637668536422646.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the end. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of 1.6329931618554523. The presence of a nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, typically increases the property value due to its influence on the molecular structure and properties.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which contains nitro groups, has a property value of 3.699377936225601. However, this molecule is much more complex than CCCN(=O)=O.

Considering the simplicity of CCCN(=O)=O compared to the more complex structures with nitro groups, we can expect the property value to be higher than that of simple aliphatic chains like CCC but lower than the complex aromatic structures with multiple nitro groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 2.0 to 2.5, considering the influence of the nitro group. A specific prediction could be approximately 2.2.

- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 2.828901215620696.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine instead of a chlorine. Fluorine is slightly more electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly affect the property value. However, the overall structure is still a halogenated benzene, which tends to have property values around 3.0.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly less than 3.0324555320336755 due to the presence of fluorine instead of chlorine. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately 3.0.

From the examples, we can observe that the property values for esters and similar structures tend to be influenced by the length of the carbon chain and the presence of functional groups. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OC (an ester with a similar structure but with a methyl group instead of an ethyl group) would likely have a similar property value.

Given the examples, the property values for molecules with similar carbon chain lengths and ester functionalities are around 2.9 to 3.0. Considering the additional ethyl group in CCCCCCC(=O)OCC compared to a methyl group, the property value might be slightly higher due to the increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately 3.0.

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate, with a property value of 2.6930079504145. The difference between methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate is the substitution of a methyl group (CH3) for an ethyl group (CH2CH3) in the ester moiety.

Given that the property values seem to be influenced by molecular size and functional groups, and considering that methyl benzoate is slightly smaller than ethyl benzoate, we can expect the property value for methyl benzoate to be slightly lower than that of ethyl benzoate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly less than 2.693, likely around 2.65.

For instance, the molecule COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a property value of 2.8320858350070908, and NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of 3.1529414466808685. These examples suggest that the presence of an oxygen-containing functional group on an aromatic ring can lead to a property value in the range of approximately 2.8 to 3.2.

Considering benzaldehyde's structure and comparing it to similar aromatic compounds in the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 2.9. Therefore, the predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately:

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 2.0702875864987447
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of these functional groups and the overall structure can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings, nitro groups, and heterocycles tend to have property values in the range of approximately 2.0 to 3.0.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like the nitro group, the property value is likely to be on the higher end of this range. However, the presence of the oxazole ring and the overall molecular structure might moderate this effect.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be approximately 2.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, a cyclic dipeptide, which is relatively small and contains two carbonyl groups and a secondary amine in a six-membered ring.

Looking at the examples, smaller cyclic structures with heteroatoms and carbonyl groups tend to have property values around 2.0 to 3.0. For instance, the molecule C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of 2.0, and other small cyclic structures with heteroatoms and carbonyl groups, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O, have values around 2.2 to 2.3.

In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC (pentane) have a property value of around 2.19, while chlorinated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) have a property value of around 3.02. The presence of chlorine generally increases the property value compared to non-chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Given that ClCC is a small, aliphatic chlorinated compound, its property value is likely to be lower than that of chlorinated aromatic compounds but higher than that of non-chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 2.5.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a hexanol, specifically 2-hexanol, which is an alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group. Let's compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. CCCCC(O)CCC (2.919612641438553) - This is a longer chain alcohol with a similar structure.
2. CCC(CC)CO (2.9923028831940863) - This is a branched alcohol with a similar structure.

Both of these examples have property values around 2.9. Given that CCCCC(C)O is a similar alcohol with a comparable chain length and branching, we can predict that its property value will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O is approximately 2.9.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Three aromatic rings (phenyl groups).
- Phosphate ester linkage (P(=O)(O-)O-).

From the examples, we can observe that:

True Property: 3.121219318886157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, and a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have property values around 3.0. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 3.0061498337295465, and Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 3.0599016922179834.

Considering the presence of both the methoxy group, which is electron-donating, and the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, the property value is likely to be influenced by the balance of these effects. The methoxy group may slightly lower the property value compared to a molecule with only electron-withdrawing groups.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 3.0. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is approximately:

3.0

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 2.7602520756252087. The given molecule has a similar level of chlorination and complexity, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to a bicyclic structure.

Considering the high degree of chlorination and the structural complexity, the property value is likely to be in a similar range to the example provided. Therefore, I would predict the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl to be approximately 2.76.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 2.4884037718761123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate. It consists of a propyl group (CCC) attached to an ester functional group (OC=O).

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCC#C (2.4330963097956344) - This is a small alkyne with a similar carbon chain length.
2. CCCCCC#C (2.646949873687806) - A longer alkyne chain.
3. CCCCCCCC=C (2.703789901245323) - A longer alkene chain.
4. CCCCCC (not listed, but would be a simple alkane).

The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) in CCCOC=O is likely to increase the property value compared to a simple alkane or alkyne of similar size due to the additional oxygen atoms and the polar nature of the ester group.

Considering the examples and the nature of the functional group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be slightly higher than that of a simple alkane or alkyne of similar size, but not as high as more complex or aromatic structures.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC=O could be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a linear alkyl ester, specifically decyl acetate. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have lower property values compared to aromatic or highly substituted compounds.
2. The presence of an ester group (as in CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C, which has a property value of 1.9697921241251515) suggests a moderate property value.
3. The length of the carbon chain can increase the property value, as seen in longer alkanes or alkenes (e.g., CCCCC(CC)C=O with a value of 3.1954118462751673).

Considering these points, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a long-chain ester, which suggests a property value that is moderate to high, but not as high as highly aromatic or halogenated compounds.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 3.5.

- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl and NO2 tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and NO2) can increase the property value.
- The presence of an amide linkage is common in several examples with moderate property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is somewhat higher than those with only a single electron-withdrawing group but not as high as those with multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups and additional complex structures.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 3.1.

- Aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is a feature seen in some of the examples with property values around 2.4 to 3.0.
- The presence of multiple ether linkages (OC) and aromatic systems, which can influence the property value.

Considering these structural features and the property values of similar molecules, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be in the range of 2.8 to 3.0. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, a reasonable estimate would be:

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which has a hydroxyl group (OH) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of 3.1529414466808685. This molecule is a nitrobenzene with a methyl group, similar to a nitrophenol.

Given that Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is structurally similar to both of these examples, particularly the nitrobenzene with a similar property value, we can predict that the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O will be close to 3.1529414466808685.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately 3.1529414466808685.

True Property: 1.689764333872913
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, resembling polysaccharides or oligosaccharides.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have property values around 2.5 to 3.0. For instance, the molecule "C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" has a property value of 2.515835979311492, which is a simple sugar-like structure.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the provided molecule, it is likely to have a slightly higher property value than the simpler sugar example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 2.8 to 3.0.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule "OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O" is approximately:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 2.4330963097956344
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with linear or simple structures, such as alkanes and simple alkynes, tend to have property values around 2.5 to 3.0.
- The presence of a triple bond, as seen in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which has a higher property value, suggests that the triple bond might increase the property value slightly compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these observations, CCC#C is simpler than the aromatic nitrile with two triple bonds but more complex than a simple alkane. Therefore, the property value for CCC#C is likely to be slightly above that of a simple alkane but below the more complex aromatic structures with multiple functional groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 2.8.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached to the pyridine ring. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic compounds with functional groups that can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with nitrogen-containing groups, such as Nc1nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (3.0243) and Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (3.0034), have property values around 3.0. The presence of a carbonyl group and a hydrazine group in the target molecule might slightly increase the property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 3.0. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a calculated property like logP (partition coefficient) or a similar descriptor.

The given molecule has the following features:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)(O))
- Multiple alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)

Comparing these features with the examples:
- Molecules with similar complexity and functional groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 (2.001) and CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (2.009), have property values around 2.0.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 2.53006045688352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the size and functional groups present in the molecules.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane, specifically octane. From the examples, we can observe that linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have property values around 2.5 to 3.5, depending on the length of the carbon chain and the presence of functional groups like hydroxyl groups.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a property value of 2.53006045688352, and CCCCCC (hexane) would likely have a slightly lower value due to the absence of the hydroxyl group and a shorter chain.

Given that CCCCCCCC (octane) is a longer chain than hexane but lacks any functional groups like alcohols, its property value would likely be slightly higher than that of hexane but lower than that of heptanol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be around 2.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and a triple bond. It resembles some of the other polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 1.6975828976870395.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 1.6883496404253646.

Both of these examples are polycyclic compounds with ketone groups and hydroxyl groups, similar to the molecule in question. The presence of the triple bond in the target molecule might slightly increase the property value due to increased unsaturation compared to the examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be slightly higher than the values for the similar polycyclic structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction would be around 1.75.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups. The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that it might have a relatively low property value compared to simpler aromatic compounds with fewer functional groups.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have lower property values. For instance, the molecule with the SMILES "C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21" has a property value of 1.330127588527747, which is relatively low due to its complex structure.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) attached. In the examples, we have:

1. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) with a property value of 3.069899265759275.
2. Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) with a property value of 3.1529414466808685.
3. Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of 3.0214653097240864.
4. Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of 3.134861511345448.

The presence of a hydroxyl group generally increases the property value compared to a simple halogenated benzene. The presence of a chlorine atom, as seen in Clc1ccccc1I, also contributes to a higher property value compared to fluorine, as seen in Fc1ccccc1.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly higher than that of Fc1ccccc1 due to the additional hydroxyl group, but potentially lower than the nitrophenols due to the absence of the nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 3.1.

- The presence of functional groups like esters and amides can slightly lower the property value compared to simple aromatic halogenated compounds.

Considering these factors, the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is expected to have a property value influenced by the aromatic ring, halogens, and the ester and amide groups. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 2.7 to 2.9.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have property values around 2.5 to 3.0.
- The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (like pyrimidine) can slightly increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the structure of the given molecule is somewhat similar to the example Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of 3.0324555320336755, and other halogenated aromatic compounds.

Taking into account the additional complexity of the molecule due to the pyrimidine ring and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, I would predict the property value to be slightly higher than 3.0.

- CCCCCCC=O (a ketone with a similar carbon chain length) has a property value of 2.558780869327957.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally closer to CCCCC(=O)OCC but lacks the additional ethyl group, which might slightly lower its property value compared to 3.0551722039096187. However, it is likely to be higher than the ketone CCCCCCC=O due to the presence of the ester group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be around 2.8.

The molecule ClCCl is a smaller and simpler structure compared to ClCCCl, as it lacks one carbon atom. Given that the property values seem to be influenced by molecular size and complexity, we can reasonably predict that the property value for ClCCl would be slightly lower than that of ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately 1.8.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures:
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 3.077660437970554. This is a dihydroxybenzene, which is more polar due to the presence of two hydroxyl groups.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O has a property value of 3.092719758380193. This is a methylphenol with an additional methyl group, making it more hydrophobic than p-cresol.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is less polar than Oc1cccc(O)c1 but similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, we can predict that its property value will be slightly lower than 3.092719758380193 due to the absence of the additional methyl group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately 3.05.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCC=C has a property value of 2.703789901245323, and CCCCCC has a value of 2.53006045688352. These examples suggest that the presence of a double bond and branching can influence the property value.

Considering the structure of isoprene, which is a small, branched alkene, I would predict its property value to be slightly higher than a straight-chain alkane but lower than more complex or larger branched alkenes.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 2.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 3.675948764555208, and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.826348678606057. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms contributes significantly to the property value.

Given that ClCCl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be lower than those of larger, more complex chlorinated compounds but still relatively high due to the presence of chlorine. Based on this reasoning and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 3.0.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 3.3421538077705124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we have:

- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 3.310532874722407.

The structure of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is very similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, differing only in the position of the chlorine atoms on the phenol ring. Both molecules are trichlorinated phenols, and the presence of chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group suggests that their properties will be quite similar.

Given the close structural similarity, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl should be very close to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 3.310532874722407.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 1.3182370054389008
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a bicyclic structure. Based on the examples, molecules with complex structures, especially those with multiple rings and heteroatoms, tend to have lower property values. 

For instance, the molecule "O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3" has a property value of 1.844, and "CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO" has a property value of 1.735. These examples suggest that complex structures with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have property values below 2.5.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the target molecule, I would predict its property value to be around 2.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 3.397091200228207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have property values around 2.5 to 3.0.
- The presence of additional functional groups like nitro, halogens, or larger alkyl groups can increase the property value.
- The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and sulfur can also influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a combination of a heterocyclic ring, a carbonyl group, and a bulky alkyl group, which suggests a property value in the mid-range of the examples provided.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be approximately 2.5.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.6930079504145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (CCOC(=O)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 2.416345735912541. This molecule is more complex due to the additional sulfonamide and heterocyclic groups.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 2.690389534648589. This molecule is a diketone with a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar in terms of aromaticity and carbonyl presence.

3. Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32 has a property value of 2.3250739440427637. This is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which shares the aromatic character with ethyl benzoate.

Considering the simplicity of ethyl benzoate compared to these examples, particularly the first one, and the presence of an ester group, which is less complex than the additional functional groups in the first example, we can estimate that the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly lower than 2.416345735912541.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 2.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.53006045688352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a characteristic like hydrophobicity or a similar property.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. This structure is similar to the example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 2.8289012156206956. However, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is an aromatic compound, while CCCCCCCBr is an aliphatic compound. 

Another relevant example is CCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of 2.53006045688352. This molecule is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group, similar in structure to CCCCCCCBr, but with an oxygen atom instead of a bromine atom. Bromine is more hydrophobic than oxygen, which might increase the property value slightly compared to CCCCCCCCO.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCCCO. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 2.6.

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic molecules with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values seem to be related to some molecular characteristic, possibly related to size, complexity, or electronic properties.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a linear structure and a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is much smaller and less complex than most of the molecules in the examples. The smallest and simplest molecules in the examples, such as CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane), have property values around 1.63. Given that CO is even simpler and smaller, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be lower than these examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be approximately 1.0.
