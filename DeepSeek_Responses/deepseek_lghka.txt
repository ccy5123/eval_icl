SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate), we can compare it to similar structures in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons) and an ester group (**-COO-**). 
2. Similar molecules with ester groups and long chains include:
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (property: -0.77871969)
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is a longer-chain version of this.

3. The presence of the ester group tends to give a moderately negative property value (around -0.7 to -0.8), while increasing chain length does not seem to drastically change this value (e.g., **CCCCCC(=O)OC** and **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** are likely similar).

4. There are no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups to significantly alter the value.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is likely close to **-0.77871969**, similar to the shorter-chain ester example.

**Predicted property value: -0.77871969**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -1.1206526290742542
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify some patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values:

1. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)** tend to increase the property value when present in higher numbers, especially if they are on aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of -0.413, while `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has 0.539).

2. **Oxygen atoms (O)** in hydroxyl (`OH`) or ether (`O-`) groups often contribute to positive values (e.g., `CCC(O)CC` = 0.255, `CO` = 0.255).

3. **Aromatic systems** with nitrogen (e.g., pyridine-like structures) tend to decrease the property value significantly (e.g., `c1cncnc1` = -8.292).

4. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** in certain contexts (e.g., amides, lactams) correlate with negative values (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` = -0.548).

5. **Bromine (Br)** and **Iodine (I)** atoms seem to increase the property value (e.g., `BrC(Cl)Cl` = 1.286, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` = 1.179).

### Target Molecule: `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`
Breaking this down:
- It contains a **chlorine (Cl)** attached to an aromatic ring.
- It has a **lactam-like structure** (`oc(=O)[nH]`) with a carbonyl (C=O) and NH group fused to an aromatic ring.
- The presence of **nitrogen in the aromatic system** (part of the fused ring) is notable.

### Similar Examples:
- `c1cncnc1` (pyridine-like, no Cl, very negative = -8.292).
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (multiple Cl on aromatics, no N, = -0.413).
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (multiple amide carbonyls, = -0.548).
- `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (Cl + aromatic N + carbonyl, = -2.405).

### Prediction:
The molecule has:
1. One Cl (increases value slightly).
2. A fused aromatic system with N and C=O (strongly decreases value).
3. No Br/I or other strongly positive contributors.

Given the strong negative contribution from the N and C=O in the aromatic system, the value will likely be negative and moderately large (but not as extreme as `c1cncnc1` because of the Cl). 

A reasonable estimate is between `-0.5` and `-2.5`. Given the similarity to `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (-2.405), but with fewer carbonyls and less steric hindrance, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -1.25** (approximate, likely between -1.0 and -1.5). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0297375973372056
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's break down the structural features that might influence the property value:

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. From the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of `-0.44343912`).

2. **Alkyl Substituents**: The molecule has an isopropyl group (**CC(C)**) attached to the nitro group. Alkyl groups are electron-donating, but the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature likely dominates.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc1nccs1` (no nitro group, but with an amino group) has a value of `-0.91604878`.
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (nitro group + alkyl + heterocycle) has a value of `-0.44343912`.
   - `NC(=O)CCl` (amide + chloro) has a value of `-0.07263608`.

Given that **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler than most of the examples but has a nitro group, its value should be moderately negative, similar to or slightly higher (less negative) than `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` because it lacks additional polar or aromatic features that might further lower the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.35** (estimated based on the nitro group's influence and comparison with similar structures). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted isn't specified (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), but the trend suggests a negative value in this range.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -2.8154434824318577
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. The molecule in question is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

This is a complex steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl (-OH), and carbonyl (C=O) groups. Comparing it to the examples:

1. **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** has a property value of **-8.29235826**. This is a similarly complex steroid with carbonyl groups, suggesting that such structures have highly negative values.
2. Simpler carbonyl-containing molecules like **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** and **CC(=O)C** have values around **-0.25302082**.
3. The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., -OH) may slightly modulate the value but not drastically.

Given the structural similarity to the first example (steroid backbone + carbonyls), but with an additional hydroxyl and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), the property value is likely still highly negative but slightly less so due to the added polarity. 

### Predicted Property Value: **-7.5** (approximate, based on the trend for complex polycyclic carbonyl structures). 

This is an educated estimate given the data, but exact prediction would require a more rigorous model or experimental data.

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.9731104615835534
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - From the examples, aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) often have property values in the range of **0.0 to -3.187**, depending on other substituents.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **0.0**, while `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has **-2.987**.

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`). 
   - Amides or similar polar groups (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`) tend to lower the property value (e.g., **-1.847** for the thiourea example).

3. **Halogen Substituents**: 
   - Fluorine substituents (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`) are present, which are highly electronegative. 
   - Example: `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has **-2.987**, suggesting fluorine can significantly reduce the property value.
   - Chlorine substituents (`Clc2ccc(Cl)cc2`) are also present, which may contribute less reduction (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **0.0**).

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) and polar amide groups suggests a strong electron-withdrawing effect, likely reducing the property value further.
   - The closest analog in the examples is `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (property = **-1.847**), which also has a polar group (thiourea) attached to an aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of:
- Two aromatic rings with halogens (F and Cl),
- Two amide groups (highly polar), and
- The electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents,

the property value is likely **lower than -1.847** (from the thiourea example) but not as extreme as `c1cncnc1` (**-8.292**), which is a highly polar heterocycle. 

A reasonable estimate is **-2.5 to -3.0**. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (trifluoromethyl benzene) has **-2.987**.
- `CN(C)c1ccccc1` (dimethylaniline) has **-3.187**.

Given the additional amide groups in the target molecule, the value should be closer to **-3.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**-2.8** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The property could represent logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the reasoning holds for electron-withdrawing/polarity effects.)

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Oxygen-containing aliphatic chains (e.g., alcohols, ethers)**:
   - Molecules like `CCCC(C)(O)CC`, `CCCCCO`, `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O`, and `CC1CCCO1` all have property values of **0.25505586**. These are aliphatic chains with a single oxygen (either -OH or -O-).
   - The molecule `CCCOC(C)C` is an ether (with -O- in the middle of an aliphatic chain), structurally similar to these examples.

2. **Other functional groups or deviations**:
   - Molecules with additional polar groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, halogens) or aromatic systems tend to have different property values.
   - The presence of branching (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)C`) or ring systems affects the property, but simple aliphatic ethers/alcohols consistently show the value **0.25505586**.

### Prediction for CCCOC(C)C:
- The molecule is an aliphatic ether with no additional functional groups or aromaticity, similar to the examples above. Thus, it is reasonable to assign the same property value as observed for other simple oxygen-containing aliphatic chains.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is **0.25505586**.

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -2.78147652714078
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Bromine (Br) substituent**: Bromine is present in the molecule, which is also seen in other examples like **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = -2.63343465) and **c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34** (property = 0.60393558). Bromine can have variable effects depending on the rest of the structure.
2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (one in a lactam-like ring and one as a ketone). Molecules with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC**, property = -0.54761995) tend to have moderate property values.
3. **Heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen**: The presence of a **n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** ring suggests polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, similar to **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (property = 0.53627747) or **COc2cnc1cncnc1n2** (property = 0.22267287).
4. **Alkyl group (CCC(C))**: The tert-butyl-like substituent adds hydrophobicity, similar to **CC(C)CCO** (property = 0.25505586).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest structural analogs are molecules with bromine + carbonyl + nitrogen, such as **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-2.63343465) and **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (1.17060025). However, the latter has additional nitro and chlorine groups, which increase the property value.
- The presence of the **n1c(=O)[nH]c** ring is somewhat similar to **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (0.53627747), but the bromine and additional carbonyl may lower the value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing bromine and carbonyl groups and the hydrophobic alkyl group, the property value is likely **moderately negative**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = -0.75 to -1.25**.  

A specific value within this range could be:  
**-1.0**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)  

**Final answer: -1.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.15391545827256672
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic systems like benzene (**c1ccccc1**) are not directly listed, but fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** has a value of **1.41908073**).
   - Biphenyl consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which is less conjugated than fused systems but more extended than a single benzene ring.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) often have lower or negative values (e.g., **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** has **-2.00739087**).
   - Biphenyl has no substituents, so its value should reflect the baseline aromatic contribution.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a phenanthrene-like structure with an amine) has a value of **1.02936614**.
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large fused aromatic system) has **1.41908073**.
   - Biphenyl is less conjugated than these fused systems but more extended than a single ring, so its value should be between simple aliphatics (e.g., **CCCCCCC** with **0.31156365**) and fused aromatics.

4. **Symmetry and Planarity**:
   - Biphenyl is not fully planar (due to steric hindrance between ortho hydrogens), which may reduce conjugation compared to fully planar fused systems.

### Prediction:
Given the above, biphenyl's property value is likely **moderate and positive**, reflecting its aromaticity but lack of strong electron-donating/withdrawing groups or extensive fusion. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

This aligns with:
- Higher than simple aliphatics (~0.3) but lower than fused aromatics (~1.0+).
- Similar to substituted aromatics with neutral contributions (e.g., **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** has **-0.11468719**, but biphenyl is more aromatic). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend.)
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.7214815044425256
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCS** (butane-1-thiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics):**
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**, **CCCCCCCC=C**) have values around **-0.11057022**.
   - Cycloalkanes (e.g., **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1**, **CCC1CCCCC1**) consistently have a value of **0.31156365**.
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1**) have values around **-0.81883844**.

2. **Functional Groups:**
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, carbonyls):**
     - Alcohols (e.g., **CC(O)C(C)(C)C**, **OC1CCCCCCC1**) have values around **0.25505586**.
     - Ethers (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**) have values around **-0.25762624**.
   - **Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., amines, amides, nitro):**
     - Amines (e.g., **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-1.44838949**).
     - Amides (e.g., **NC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1**) have positive values (e.g., **0.55923213**).
   - **Sulfur-containing groups:**
     - Thiols or sulfides are not explicitly present in the examples, but sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**) have values around **0.39188266**.
     - Thiophenes or similar structures (not present here) might behave differently.

3. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I):**
   - Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**) have very negative values (e.g., **-1.44838949**).
   - Aliphatic halides (e.g., **CC(C)I**) can have positive values (e.g., **1.05438158**).

4. **Polarity and Size:**
   - Larger, more polar molecules tend to have higher absolute values (positive or negative), while small aliphatic molecules have values closer to zero.

### Analysis of **CCCCS**:
- **Structure:** Butane-1-thiol is a small aliphatic molecule with a thiol (-SH) group.
- **Analogies:**
  - It resembles alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**) but with a sulfur substituent.
  - The thiol group is polar but less polar than alcohols or amines.
  - No direct examples of thiols are given, but sulfur-containing aliphatic molecules (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**) have positive values (~0.39).
  - The property value is likely between the alkane value (**-0.11057022**) and the sulfur-containing molecule value (**0.39188266**).

### Prediction:
Given the small size and aliphatic nature of **CCCCS**, but with the added polarity of the thiol group, I predict a value slightly higher than simple alkanes but lower than more complex sulfur-containing molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCS: 0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains with Oxygen (Alcohols/Ethers):**
   - **CCCCOC (ether):** Property value = **0.25505586**
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O (alcohol):** Property value = **0.25505586**
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC (alcohol):** Property value = **0.25505586**
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (alcohol):** Property value = **0.25505586**

   These examples suggest that branched or linear aliphatic alcohols/ethers with similar structures tend to have property values around **0.255**.

2. **Branched Hydrocarbons (No Oxygen):**
   - **CCC(C)(C)C:** Property value = **0.31156365**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C:** Property value = **0.31156365**

   These show that fully branched hydrocarbons (no heteroatoms) have slightly higher property values (~0.311).

3. **Impact of Oxygen:**
   The presence of an **-OH group** (alcohol) seems to reduce the property value slightly compared to fully branched hydrocarbons (e.g., 0.255 vs. 0.311).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alcohol with a structure similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** and **CC(C)CC(C)O**, which both have a property value of **0.25505586**.
- The only difference is the position of the **-OH group**, but the branching and chain length are comparable.
- No other functional groups or heteroatoms are present to significantly alter the property.

### Prediction:
Given the consistency in the property values for similar branched alcohols, the predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is:

**0.25505586**

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.8188384361297739
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's break down the structural features and compare them to the provided data to predict the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - The molecule contains a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl substituent (`Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`). 
   - Similar molecules with naphthalene cores and alkyl substituents:
     - `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (property: **-0.81883844**)
     - `c1ccccc1` (benzene, property: **-2.07644261**)
     - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (toluene derivative, property: **-2.07644261**).
   - The presence of a naphthalene core tends to increase the property value compared to benzene (e.g., `c1ccccc1` vs. `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12`).

2. **Methyl Substituent**:
   - Methyl groups (`C`) on aromatic systems tend to slightly increase the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatics (e.g., `c1ccccc1` vs. `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` has the same value, but larger systems like `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` show a higher value).

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The closest match is `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (property: **-0.81883844**), which has an additional methyl group compared to the target molecule (`Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`). 
   - The absence of the second methyl group in the target molecule suggests its property value might be slightly lower (more negative) than **-0.81883844** but higher than plain benzene (**-2.07644261**).

4. **Other Naphthalene Derivatives**:
   - `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (property: **0.28060423**) has a more extended conjugated system (anthracene-like), which is not directly comparable.
   - The target molecule is simpler, so its value should be closer to `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12`.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (property: **-0.81883844**) but with one fewer methyl group, the property value for `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is likely slightly higher (less negative). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar structures). 

However, looking at the exact matches and trends, the value is likely very close to **-0.81883844** (as the additional methyl in the reference may not drastically change the property). For consistency with the closest match, the predicted value is:

**-0.81883844** (same as `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12`, as the methyl group's effect may be minor in this context). 

But since the target lacks the second methyl, a slightly adjusted value (e.g., **-0.80**) might be more accurate. Given the examples, the most precise prediction is:

**-0.81883844** (same as the closest naphthalene derivative with a methyl group). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.81883844**

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.013807098202707148
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, halogens, etc.). The property values range from negative (e.g., highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups) to positive (e.g., hydrophobic or halogen-rich structures).

The molecule in question is:  
**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Three carbonyl groups (C=O)**: These are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which often lowers the property value (as seen in similar structures like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` with a value of **0.0138071**).
2. **Two amide (N-C=O) groups**: These are highly polar and typically reduce the property value (similar to the first example, `c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1`, with a value of **-0.63176382**).
3. **Alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)**: This introduces hydrophobicity, which tends to increase the property value (e.g., `CC(C)C` has **0.31156365**).
4. **Alkene (CC=C)**: Slightly polar but less impactful than carbonyls.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The closest analog is `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` (property = **0.0138071**).  
- The additional alkyl chain (`C(C)CCC`) here adds hydrophobicity, which would likely *increase* the property value slightly compared to the reference molecule. However, the dominant polar groups (carbonyls/amides) will keep the value low.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar carbonyl/amide groups and the hydrophobic alkyl chain, the property value should be **slightly higher** than `0.0138071` but still close to zero.  

**Predicted property value: 0.05**  

*(This is a rough estimate based on the examples, where similar structures with mixed polar/hydrophobic features fall near zero. The exact value would require a quantitative model, but this aligns with the trend observed in the data.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -2.987853388067521
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 (trifluoromethylbenzene)

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents:**
   - `c1ccccc1` (benzene) is not directly given, but substituted benzenes provide clues.
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (iodochlorobenzene): 0.606
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl): 0.539
   - `COc1ccccc1O` (methoxyphenol): -1.303
   - `Cc1ccccc1CC` (ethyltoluene): -2.076

2. **Fluorine Substituents:**
   - Fluorine is highly electronegative and often reduces the property value compared to chlorine or other halogens (as seen in the examples where Cl substituents tend to increase the value relative to F).
   - The trifluoromethyl group (`CF3`) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Groups:**
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `CF3`, `NO2`, `CN`) tend to decrease the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., `OCH3`, `CH3`) tend to increase or have less negative values.

### Prediction:
The molecule `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has a benzene ring with a strongly electron-withdrawing `CF3` group. Comparing to similar structures:
- `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (0.606) has less electron-withdrawing halogens.
- `COc1ccccc1O` (-1.303) has electron-donating methoxy and hydroxy groups, leading to a more negative value.
- `Cc1ccccc1CC` (-2.076) has alkyl groups, which are weakly donating but still result in a negative value.

Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of `CF3`, the property value is likely **lower than the chlorinated analogs but higher than the alkylated or oxygenated analogs**. A reasonable estimate is around **0.2 to 0.4**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.35** (specific value based on interpolation of trends).

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.07263607581666036
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional groups. Let's analyze the molecule in question:

**Molecule:**  
`OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`  
This is a sugar-like molecule (a hexose derivative, likely glucose or a similar carbohydrate) with multiple hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups and an ether (`-O-`) linkage. 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Highly polar, polyhydroxy compounds** tend to have negative property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of `-0.07263608`).  
2. **Aromatic or conjugated systems** with fewer polar groups tend to have less negative or positive values.  
3. **Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors** (like `-OH` or `-NH`) often lower the property value.  

This molecule has **5 hydroxyl groups and 1 ether oxygen**, making it very polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. Comparing it to similar molecules in the examples:
- `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = `-0.07263608`) has 5 hydroxyls and 1 ether oxygen, similar to our molecule.  
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (property = `-1.30347995`) has 2 hydroxyls but is aromatic, which likely reduces the negative impact.  

Our molecule is even more polar and hydrogen-bonding than `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, so its property value should be slightly more negative.  

### Predicted property value:  
**`-0.15`**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend that increased polarity/hydrogen bonding correlates with more negative values, but the exact value may depend on finer structural details not captured here.)*  

---  
*Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is a generalized interpretation. If the property is logP, the value would likely be more negative due to high hydrophilicity.*

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 0.23740478582181865
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule contains multiple carbonyl groups (acetate-like fragments: CC(=O)O and CC(=O)C), which are polar and can influence the property. From the examples, carbonyls often appear in molecules with moderately negative to positive property values (e.g., -0.253 for CCCCC(=O)CCCC, 0.013 for CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2).
2. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure (C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C). Similar structures in the examples (e.g., CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C with -1.154) suggest that large, rigid polycyclic systems with polar substituents tend to have negative property values.
3. **Hydroxy groups (OH)**: The presence of hydroxy groups (C3(O) and C(O)) adds polarity. In the examples, polyols like OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO have a slightly negative value (-0.072), but here the effect may be offset by the steroid core.
4. **Conjugated system**: The =CC(=O)C=C fragment introduces conjugation, which can slightly lower the property value (similar to aromatic systems, which often have negative values).

### Comparison to closest examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: This is very similar to the given molecule but lacks the C=CC=C conjugation and one OH group. Its property value is -1.638.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: Simpler steroid-like structure with one OH and one C=O, property value -1.154.

### Adjustments for differences:
1. The given molecule has an additional C=O (in CC(=O)OCC(=O)) and a conjugated system, which may slightly increase the property value compared to -1.638 (less negative).
2. The additional OH group could further increase the property value (less negative), but the conjugation may counteract this.

### Predicted property value:
Given the similarities to the example with -1.638 and the additional polar/conjugated features, the property value is likely slightly higher (less negative). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.45**  

This balances the effects of the additional polar groups and conjugation while staying close to the structurally similar example.

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -0.342204334442094
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. 

The molecule in question is:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**

### Key observations about this molecule:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: It has a fused polycyclic framework (resembling steroidal cores, e.g., cholestane or similar), which is highly hydrophobic but with polar modifications.
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - A ketone (`C=O`) at position 2 on one of the rings.
   - A hydroxyl group (`OH`) on the terminal ring (position 4).
3. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and heavily branched, which typically contributes to lower property values (more negative) in the given examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` has a value of **-2.52800548**).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property: **-2.52800548**): This is a steroid-like molecule with an aromatic ring and hydroxyl groups, similar in complexity to the query molecule. The query lacks aromaticity but has a ketone, which is slightly less polar than a hydroxyl but still contributes to a negative value.
- `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` (property: **-0.54761995**): This has two amide carbonyls and is less bulky, yet still moderately negative.
- `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1` (property: **-2.07644261**): A simple branched aromatic, showing that branching and size reduce the value.

### Prediction:
The query molecule is larger and more hydrophobic than most examples but has polar groups (C=O and OH) that offset this slightly. Its structure is most similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`, but without the aromatic ring, which might reduce the magnitude of the negative value slightly. 

**Predicted property value: -2.2**  
*(This is an estimate based on interpolation between the steroid-like example (-2.528) and less complex molecules with polar groups.)*

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.40204520254564285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CC(=O)N)**: This is a polar group that can participate in hydrogen bonding (as both donor and acceptor). From the examples, molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` with -1.690) tend to have negative or moderate values, but the exact impact depends on other substituents.
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Examples like `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (-0.575) and `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.115) suggest nitro groups often contribute to negative or slightly positive values, depending on the rest of the molecule.
   - **Aromatic ring (c1ccc(cc1))**: This provides a hydrophobic core. Substituted aromatics with polar groups (e.g., `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1` at -0.786) often have negative values.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a nitro group and an aromatic ring with a methoxy substituent, giving a value of **-0.11468719**.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` is nitrobenzene, with a value of **-0.57505441**.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has an amide and a hydrophobic chain, with a value of **-1.69031292**.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The acetamide group (`CC(=O)N`) is more polar than a methoxy group, likely pulling the value downward (more negative) compared to `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`.
   - The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature further reduces the value.
   - However, the aromatic ring with two substituents (amide and nitro) may balance the polarity somewhat.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` is expected to have a property value **between -0.5 and -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.115) but less extreme than `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (-1.690). 

**Predicted value: -0.65** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples' trends for polarity/hydrophobicity-like properties.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.1900088154568455
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, functional groups, halogenation, and molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. Similar groups in the examples (e.g., esters, amides) often contribute negatively to the property (e.g., -0.778 for CCCC(=O)OC).
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC)**: The sulfur-carbon bond may slightly increase the property value (e.g., CSSC has a high value of 1.031).
3. **Aromatic system with Cl substitution (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The aromatic system is similar to some examples (e.g., Cl-substituted aromatics like Clc1cccc2ccccc12 has -2.664).
   - The Cl substitution tends to lower the property (e.g., Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 has 0.430, but Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has -3.187).
   - The lactam (c(=O)o) is electron-withdrawing and may further reduce the property.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The molecule combines features of polar/electron-withdrawing groups (P(=S), C=O, Cl) and aromaticity. 
- Examples with multiple polar/electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic systems tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5** (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC has -0.548; O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has 0.489).
- The presence of sulfur (S) may slightly increase the value (e.g., CSSC has 1.031).

### Predicted property:
Given the balance of electron-withdrawing groups (P(=S), C=O, Cl) and the aromatic system, the property is likely **close to 0**, but slightly negative due to the Cl and P(=S) contributions. 

**Predicted value: ~0.25**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trends in the provided data, particularly weighing the effects of Cl, P(=S), and aromaticity.)*

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value for molecules with the general structure of an alcohol (containing an -OH group) and a simple hydrocarbon chain or branched structure tends to cluster around **0.25505586**. This is observed in the following molecules:

- CC(C)CO: 0.25505586  
- CCC: 0.31156365 (similar, slightly higher due to shorter chain)  
- CC(C)CO: 0.25505586  
- CCCCC(CC)CO: 0.25505586  
- CCCCCCC(C)O: 0.25505586  

The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (2-methyl-2-propanol) with a branched structure, similar to the other alcohols listed. Despite the increased branching, the presence of the -OH group appears to dominate the property value, keeping it consistent with the trend.  

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:  
**0.25505586**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.013807098202707148
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **purine-like heterocycle** with two fused rings (imidazole and pyrimidine), containing multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O).
2. It has **hydrogen-bond donors (N-H)** and **acceptors (N and C=O)**, which can influence polarity and solubility.
3. The structure resembles nucleobases (e.g., guanine or hypoxanthine), which are typically polar and have moderate to low hydrophobicity.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property: **-0.54761995**): This is a fluorinated pyrimidine derivative with similar N-H and C=O groups. The property is moderately negative.
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: **-0.75337696**): A pyrimidine with N-H and C=O, similar to our target but less fused. The property is more negative.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property: **0.22267287**): A methoxy-purine derivative with less polarity due to the methoxy group. The property is slightly positive.

### Key Observations:
- Fused nitrogen-rich heterocycles with polar groups (C=O, N-H) tend to have **negative property values** (more hydrophilic).
- The presence of additional rings or electronegative substituents (e.g., F, Cl) can further lower the value.
- Our molecule lacks non-polar substituents (e.g., alkyl groups) and is highly polar due to multiple N-H and C=O groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the high polarity and similarity to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1**, but with an extra fused ring (increasing conjugation and polarity), the property should be **more negative** than -0.547 but less extreme than -0.753. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This balances the influence of the fused ring system and the polar functional groups.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. Let's analyze the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate with an isopropyl group, or more accurately, isopropyl formate) and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key observations from the dataset:
1. **Alcohols and ethers (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CC(C)O, CCCCCO)**: These often have a property value of **0.25505586**.
   - Example: CC(C)O (isopropanol) = 0.25505586.
2. **Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)C)**: These tend to have slightly lower or similar values to alcohols/ethers, depending on additional substituents.
   - Example: CCOC(=O)C (ethyl acetate) is not directly in the dataset, but esters with simple alkyl groups are likely close to 0.255.
3. **Molecules with C=O (carbonyl) groups**: These can vary, but simple aliphatic carbonyls (like ketones or aldehydes) often have values around **-0.25 to 0.25**.
   - Example: CCC(C)C(=O)C (methyl isobutyl ketone) = -0.25302082.
4. **Molecules with multiple polar groups or halogens**: These deviate more significantly (e.g., negative values for highly polar or halogenated compounds).

### Analysis of CC(C)OC=O:
- This is an ester (isopropyl formate) with a structure similar to simple alcohols/ethers but with a carbonyl (C=O) group.
- The presence of the ester group (C=O and O-alkyl) suggests a slight reduction in the property value compared to pure alcohols/ethers (which are 0.255).
- No halogens or highly polar substituents are present, so the value should not deviate too far from the alcohol/ether baseline.

### Predicted property value:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)O (isopropanol) = 0.25505586** but with an ester group (slightly reducing the value), a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.20 to 0.25**.  

Looking at the dataset, the closest match is likely **0.25505586** (same as simple alcohols/ethers, as the ester's effect may not be strong enough to significantly alter the value). However, if we account for the carbonyl's slight reduction, a value of **0.22267287** (similar to COc1ncnc2nccnc12, which has polar groups) might also be plausible.  

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**0.25505586** (same as CC(C)O, as the ester group's impact is not clearly differentiated in the dataset).  

However, if we assume the ester group reduces the value slightly, an alternative prediction could be **0.22267287**.  

Given the uncertainty, I would default to the alcohol/ether value unless there is direct evidence otherwise.  

### Final prediction:  
**0.25505586** (same as CC(C)O and other simple alcohols/ethers).  

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar metric, esters are typically slightly less polar than alcohols, so this value is plausible. If the dataset suggests esters deviate, further refinement would be needed.)

**Answer:** 0.25505586
==================================================
Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.8158847907305384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) connected via a urea-like linkage (**N-C(=O)-N**). 
   - Urea derivatives often exhibit moderate polarity due to the presence of hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (NH and C=O).

2. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Two benzene rings are present, similar to molecules like **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (property: -1.448) or **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -0.819). 
   - However, the urea linkage adds more polarity than simple substituents like Cl or alkyl groups.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The **N-C(=O)-N** group can form hydrogen bonds, which may lower the property value (more negative) compared to non-hydrogen-bonding aromatic systems. 
   - Compare to **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (property: -0.575) or **NC(=S)N** (property: -0.211), where polar amide/thiourea groups are present.

4. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: 
   - The molecule is symmetric with two identical phenyl rings, which may stabilize the structure but not drastically affect the property.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol with Cl): -1.448  
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (amide with pyridine): -0.575  
- **c1ccncc1** (pyridine): -2.949  
- **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthalene derivative): -0.819  

The urea linkage here is more polar than a simple ether or alkyl group but less polar than a nitro or strongly electron-withdrawing group. Given the symmetry and moderate polarity, the property value should lie between **-1.5 and -0.5**.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-1.2**, balancing the aromaticity (which tends to increase the property) and the polar urea group (which tends to decrease it). 

Thus, the predicted property for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is:  
**-1.2** (approximate; exact value would require empirical data or a model).

**Note**: This is a heuristic prediction based on structural similarities. For precise values, computational or experimental methods are needed.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.15391545827256672
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically fluorene), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., fused rings like naphthalene or anthracene derivatives) tend to have property values in the range of **0.4 to 1.4**. 
   - Example: `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **0.86154198**.
   - Example: `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two linked phenyl rings) has a value of **0.46481971**.

2. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)**:
   - Fluorene has three fused rings (two benzene rings fused to a cyclopentadiene ring), which is less extended than the large polycyclic example but more conjugated than simple biphenyls.
   - The presence of fused aromatic rings (without strongly electronegative substituents) suggests a moderately positive property value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The large polycyclic aromatic (`c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`) has **0.86154198**.
   - A simpler biphenyl-like structure (`N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) has **0.46481971**.
   - Fluorene is intermediate in size/conjugation between these two.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to these examples, the property value for fluorene (**C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**) is likely in the range of **0.6 to 0.9**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.75** (specific value approximated based on the trend). 

This aligns with the observed trend where larger conjugated/fused aromatic systems have higher values in this dataset. 

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** is approximately **0.75**.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.1926873683915637
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N)**: Highly polar and often associated with moderate to high property values (e.g., see molecules with sulfonamides or sulfonyl groups in the examples).
   - **Guanidine (NC(=N)N)**: Very polar and basic, likely contributing to higher property values.
   - **Aromatic amine (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Polar but less so than the other groups.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The presence of a benzene ring with an amine substituent is common in the examples, often associated with negative or low-positive values unless balanced by other polar groups.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with **sulfonamides** (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**) have values around **-1.30347995**, but this also includes a thiazole ring, which may lower the value.
   - Molecules with **polar groups like amines and sulfonyls** but no strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**) have values close to zero (**-0.00377388**).
   - The **guanidine group (NC(=N)N)** is highly polar and basic, likely increasing the property value compared to simpler amines.

4. **Overall Polarity**:
   - The combination of **guanidine + sulfonamide + aromatic amine** suggests a highly polar molecule, but the exact balance depends on how these interact. The sulfonamide may partially offset the guanidine's effect.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the high polarity from the guanidine and sulfonamide, but the lack of strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or halogens) to push the value higher, a reasonable estimate would be in the **low-positive range**, similar to molecules with balanced polar groups.

**Predicted value: 0.45**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, likely between 0.2 and 0.6 given the polar groups.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is a generalized estimate. If the property is logP, the value would likely be lower due to the polar groups; if it’s a measure of polarity or basicity, it could be higher.)*

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.1130314568269974
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` by analyzing structural features and trends in the data.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl, F, CF3)** tend to have lower (more negative) property values. For example:
   - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl`: -3.1873338  
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`: -5.58857482 (strongly negative due to multiple Cl and polar groups).  
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`: -0.11468719 (NO2 reduces the value).  

2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** significantly reduce the property value, especially when multiple are present.  

3. **Fluorinated groups (e.g., CF3)** also contribute to lowering the value, as seen in molecules with halogens.  

4. **Aliphatic chains or non-polar groups** tend to have positive or near-zero values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC`: 0.31156365).  

5. **Polar or charged groups (e.g., amines, carbonyls)** can either increase or decrease the value depending on context.  

### Analysis of the target molecule:
`CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`  
- Contains **two nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**, which strongly reduce the property value.  
- Has a **trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**, which is highly electron-withdrawing and further reduces the value.  
- The rest of the molecule includes an aliphatic amine (`CCN`) and an alkene (`CC(C)=C`), but these are outweighed by the strongly electron-withdrawing groups.  

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has two Cl atoms and a polar amide group, yielding -5.58857482.  
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has one NO2, yielding -0.11468719.  
- The target molecule has **two NO2 groups and a CF3 group**, which are even more electron-withdrawing than Cl.  

### Predicted property value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents, the value should be **more negative than -5.58857482** (the most negative example). However, the exact value is hard to pinpoint without a model, but a reasonable estimate would be around **-6.0**.

### Final answer:
**Predicted property value: -6.0** (approximate, likely in the range of -5.5 to -6.5 based on the examples).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CCCCCCCCO, OC1CCCCCC1, CCC(O)CC, CCC(C)(C)O)**:
   - These molecules have property values of **0.25505586**. They share the structural feature of a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic chain.

2. **Aldehydes/Ketones (e.g., CC(=O)N, CC(=O)C, O=C1CCCCC1, CCCCCCCC(=O)C)**:
   - These molecules have property values around **-0.25302082 to -0.77871969**. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in an aliphatic context tends to lower the property value.

3. **Esters (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, CCCCCCOC(=O)C)**:
   - These molecules have property values of **-0.77871969**. The ester functional group (-COO-) seems to correlate with this value.

4. **Ethers (e.g., CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester-like structure (methyl formate derivative with a branched alkyl group). Given the ester trend, it is likely to have a property value similar to other esters.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- The molecule is **isopropyl formate** (an ester with the structure R-O-CO-H, where R = isopropyl).
- Esters in the examples consistently show a property value of **-0.77871969** (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O, CCOC(=O)C, etc.).

### Prediction:
Given the strong consistency of ester-containing molecules having a property value of **-0.77871969**, the predicted property for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**-0.77871969**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -3.1873338018286446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with the structure:
- A benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (`C`) at positions 1 and 3 (`c1cc(C)cc(O)c1`).
  - A hydroxyl group (`O`) at position 4.

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a property value of **-3.1873338**.
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (a phenol fused to a cyclohexane) has a value of **-3.1873338**.
   - Phenol itself is highly negative, suggesting that the hydroxyl group contributes significantly to lowering the property value.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (dimethylbenzene) has a value of **-3.1873338** (same as phenol, but this seems inconsistent; likely an error or the property is dominated by another feature).
   - `CC(C)C` (isobutane) has a value of **0.31156365**, suggesting alkyl groups tend to increase the property slightly.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - When hydroxyl and alkyl groups are both present (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1`), the value is **0.4020452**, which is positive. This suggests that multiple hydroxyls and ether/ester groups can increase the property.
   - `CCCCCC(C)(C)O` (a branched alcohol) has a value of **0.25505586**, similar to other alcohols like `C1CCOC1` and `CO`.

4. **Methylphenol Examples**:
   - No exact methylphenol examples are given, but we can infer:
     - Phenol (`c1ccccc1O`) is very negative (**-3.1873338**).
     - Adding methyl groups (as in `Cc1cccc(C)c1`) doesn't seem to change the value much (still **-3.1873338**), but this may not be reliable.
     - The hydroxyl group's effect seems dominant, but methyl groups may slightly offset the negativity.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol is **-3.1873338**.
- Methyl groups alone (e.g., `CC(C)C`) are **~0.31156365**.
- The target molecule has **two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group**, the net effect is likely less negative than phenol but still negative.

A reasonable estimate is between **-2.0 and -1.0**, closer to examples like `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3` (**0.86154198**) but adjusted for the hydroxyl group's strong negative contribution.

However, looking at `CCc1ccccc1C` (ethylbenzene-like), which is **-2.07644261**, and considering the hydroxyl group's effect, the value might be slightly more negative.

### Final Prediction:
Given the uncertainty, a plausible prediction for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is:  
**-1.5** (approximate, considering the hydroxyl group's strong negative contribution and methyl groups' slight positive offset).  

But reviewing the examples again, `O=Cc1ccccc1` (benzaldehyde) is **-1.7046141**, and `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) is **-0.81883844**. Since our molecule is less aromatic than naphthalene but has a hydroxyl group, a value around **-1.0 to -2.0** seems reasonable.  

Given the closest analogies, I predict:  
**-1.353607** (similar to `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2`).  

However, this is speculative. The exact value is hard to pinpoint without a clear trend, but it is likely **negative and between -1.0 and -2.0**.  

For a specific number, I'll choose:  
**-1.353607** (matching the closest structural analog with a hydroxyl and alkyl groups).  

---
**Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -1.353607**  
---
(Note: This is an educated guess based on limited analogous examples. The actual value may vary.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.22583239623820267
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)** fragment tend to have positive property values, typically in the range of **0.8 to 1.2**. Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **0.99116953**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **1.17910961**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **0.82711718**

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, I) on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value slightly.
   - In this case, the aromatic ring has **SC (thioether)** and **C (methyl)** substituents. Thioethers are moderately electron-donating, which may slightly reduce the property compared to halogenated analogs.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The closest analog in the examples is `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property = **0.82711718**), where the aromatic ring is fully substituted with chlorines. 
   - Replacing one chlorine with **SC** (less electron-withdrawing) and another with **C (methyl)** would likely decrease the property slightly, but the **P(=S)** core still dominates.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the **P(=S)** group and the moderately electron-donating substituents (**SC** and **C**), the property value should be slightly lower than the chlorinated analogs but still in the **0.7 to 0.9** range. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property = 0.78**  

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples while accounting for the substituent effects.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.1496959666318993
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with the presence of halogens (especially chlorine), aromatic systems, and molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substituents on both aromatic rings. From the examples, we can observe that heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.6**, depending on the number and arrangement of chlorines. For instance:

- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **0.53874764**
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **0.83629949**
- **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** → **1.66185967**

The given molecule has **6 chlorines** distributed symmetrically across two aromatic rings, similar to the second example above but with slightly less chlorination than the third example. 

Given this, the predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** would likely be close to the second example but slightly higher due to the additional chlorine. 

### Predicted property value: **~0.85** (approximating between 0.836 and 1.66, leaning toward the lower end due to fewer chlorines than the third example). 

A refined estimate would place it around **0.9**. 

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**0.90** (rounded from the trend observed in the data).

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0297375973372056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values, especially when attached to aromatic rings or other electronegative environments. 
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a high value of **1.06042996** (two nitro groups on an aromatic ring).
   - Example: `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` has a value of **0.25196813** (no nitro group, but nitrile groups, which are less polar than nitro).

2. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.90561784** (two nitro groups, one aliphatic and one aromatic).
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is a simple aliphatic nitro compound (nitropropane). 

3. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCC`, `CC`, `CCCCCCCCC`) have values around **0.31156365**.
   - When functional groups are added (e.g., nitro, halogens), the property value shifts significantly.

4. **Polarity and Electronegativity**:
   - Nitro groups are highly polar and electronegative, which likely increases the property value compared to plain alkanes.
   - The presence of an aliphatic nitro group (as in `CCCN(=O)=O`) should give a value higher than plain alkanes but lower than aromatic nitro compounds.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Plain alkanes: ~0.31156365.
- Aromatic nitro compounds: ~1.06042996.
- Aliphatic nitro compounds (like `CCCN(=O)=O`) should fall somewhere in between, likely closer to the higher end due to the nitro group's strong effect.

Looking at similar aliphatic nitro examples (none exactly match, but `CCCN(CCC)...N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.90561784**), we can estimate that `CCCN(=O)=O` would have a value slightly lower because it has only one nitro group and no aromatic stabilization.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for `CCCN(=O)=O` is approximately **0.75**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.342204334442094
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F) tend to have property values in the range of **~0.3 to ~1.5**, especially when multiple halogens are present. 
   - For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.29767016 (Cl and Br substitution)
     - **BrC(Br)Br**: 1.50962464 (three Br atoms)
     - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: -0.41344854 (multiple Cl substitutions, but slightly negative due to other factors).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Single Halogen Substitutions**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.29767016 (Cl and Br on benzene)
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: -1.44838949 (Cl + methoxy group, which may lower the value)
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, but with F instead of Cl.

3. **Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative but less polarizable than Cl/Br. In the given examples, F-substituted molecules (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**) have slightly negative values, but this may be due to other functional groups.
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has both F and Br, which may balance the effect (Br tends to increase the value, while F may slightly decrease it).

4. **Comparison to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **0.29767016**.
   - Replacing Cl with F (smaller, more electronegative) might slightly reduce the value, but the Br substitution should keep it positive.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (0.29767016) and the fact that F is slightly less bulky/less polarizable than Cl, the value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely **slightly lower** but still positive. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (rounded from ~0.25 to 0.30 range).

### Exact Value:
Matching the trend of halogenated aromatics, the predicted value is:  
**0.25** (specific: **0.25000000**). 

However, since the training example **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** is 0.29767016, and F is somewhat similar to Cl but slightly less contributing, a more precise prediction would be:  
**0.28** (to reflect the slight reduction due to F). 

Given the examples, the closest match is likely:  
**0.28** (but if forced to pick from the training distribution, **0.29767016** is the closest for a mono-halogenated aromatic with Br). 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.28** (or **0.29767016** if assuming identical contribution as Cl/Br pair). 

Given the data, the most justifiable prediction is:  
**0.28**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, we'll use:  
**0.28000000**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** is 0.29767016, and **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is very similar, so the value is likely close to that. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.29767016** (same as Cl/Br case, as F and Cl are often similar in such contributions). 

But since F is slightly less polarizable, a 5% reduction gives:  
**0.28**. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer is:  
**0.28**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.28**
==================================================
Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one of the rings. It has two tertiary carbons (attached to the bridgehead positions) and no highly polar or charged groups beyond the -OH.
2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: This is a complex steroid-like molecule with multiple rings, -OH, and carbonyl groups. Its property value is **-0.49446385**.
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Another steroid-like molecule with -OH and carbonyl groups. Its property value is **-0.60309328**.
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: A simpler steroid-like molecule with -OH and a carbonyl group. Its property value is **-1.15458701**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of an -OH group tends to lower the property value (more negative) compared to purely hydrocarbon structures (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)O** has a value of **0.25505586**).
   - Bicyclic or polycyclic structures with -OH groups tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to -1.5**, depending on additional functional groups (e.g., carbonyls or halogens further lower the value).
   - The given molecule is simpler than the steroid-like examples but shares the bicyclic + -OH motif. It lacks additional electronegative groups (like F or Cl) or carbonyls, so its value should be less negative than the steroid examples.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid-like molecules but with fewer polar groups, the property value for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, is:  
**-0.45** (interpolating between simpler alcohols and more complex polycyclic -OH structures).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -2.0073908651204455
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will analyze the given molecule and compare its structural features to those in the examples to predict the property value.

### Molecule to predict:
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

### Structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = -0.48891855)
   The main difference is the replacement of the **SC(CCl)** group with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**.

2. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (lactam) fused to a benzene ring, similar to structures like:
   - **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2** (property = -0.54761995)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C** (property = 0.0138071)
   The presence of the aromatic ring may influence the property differently.

3. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are present in both the given molecule and the similar phosphorothioate example above.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
The closest match is:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = -0.48891855)
The only difference is the **SC(CCl)** substituent replaced by a lactam ring. The lactam ring is more polar and may slightly increase the property value compared to the thioether group.

Other lactam-containing molecules have property values around:
- -0.54761995 (non-aromatic lactam)
- 0.0138071 (aromatic-influenced lactam)

### Prediction:
Given that the lactam ring here is aromatic and the phosphorothioate group is similar to the example with a property of -0.48891855, I would expect the property to be slightly higher (less negative) due to the aromatic lactam's influence. 

**Predicted property value: -0.40** (approximate, likely between -0.50 and -0.30). 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (closer to the phosphorothioate example but adjusted for the lactam). 

However, looking more carefully, the lactam in this case is part of a fused aromatic system (like in some other examples), which might push the value closer to **-0.35**. 

After reconsidering, the best match is the phosphorothioate example with a lactam-like group, so I'll stick with:  
**Predicted property: -0.45** (interpolating between the closest examples). 

But to be precise, the original phosphorothioate example with a similar structure was -0.48891855, and the lactam is slightly less negative, so:  
**Final predicted value: -0.40**. 

However, the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a value of -0.48891855, and replacing **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a more polar group) might not change the value drastically. Thus, the prediction is likely close to the original example. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer is:  
**Predicted property: -0.45** (similar to the closest phosphorothioate example). 

But reviewing again, the lactam-aromatic system might make it slightly less negative, so:  
**Predicted property: -0.40**. 

After careful consideration, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.42**. 

However, to match the precision of the given examples, I'll round to:  
**-0.40**. 

### Final answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.40** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the closest examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The true value could vary slightly depending on the property's dependence on specific functional groups.) 

But looking back, the closest match is the phosphorothioate with a value of -0.48891855, and the new molecule is very similar, so:  
**Predicted value: -0.49**. 

Given the noise in the data, I'll settle on:  
**-0.45**. 

### Final decision:
**Predicted property: -0.45**. 

(Note: This is an interpolation based on the examples. For a precise prediction, a model trained on more data would be needed.) 

After careful thought, the most consistent answer is:  
**-0.45**. 

Thus, the predicted property for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is:  
**-0.45**.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.2077684224614571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core (two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring with a carbonyl group, resembling a uracil or hydantoin derivative). This is similar to some of the provided examples with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups.
   - Example: `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` has a property value of **0.69912245**.
   - Example: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` has a property value of **-0.54761995**.

2. **Aromatic Substituents**: The molecule has a phenyl ring attached to the heterocycle, which is also present in some of the examples with higher property values (e.g., `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` at **0.69912245**).

3. **Methyl Groups**: The two methyl groups (`Cc1...n1C`) are likely to slightly increase hydrophobicity or steric bulk, similar to other methylated examples.

4. **Polarity**: The carbonyl group (`C=O`) introduces polarity, but the aromatic systems and methyl groups balance this, leading to moderate property values in similar cases.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The molecule most closely resembles `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` (property = **0.69912245**) but with slightly less polarity due to the lack of additional amide groups.
- It also shares features with `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (property = **-0.54761995**), but the aromatic rings likely push the value higher.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of aromaticity, carbonyl polarity, and methyl groups, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is approximately:

**0.65** (estimated range: 0.6 to 0.7 based on similar structures). 

This aligns with the trend observed for molecules with fused aromatic-heterocyclic systems and moderate polarity.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, amines, or carbonyls) tend to have lower (more negative) property values.
     - Example: **O=C1CCC(=O)N1** (cyclic diketone) has a very low value of **-3.14204244**.
     - **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCCCC1)C(=O)N2** (cyclic imide with a long aliphatic chain) has **-0.54761995**.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., alkanes, simple ethers) tend to have higher (more positive) values.
     - Example: **CCCCC** (pentane) has **0.31156365**.
     - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (phosphate ester) has **0.45514812**.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or branching often increase the property value slightly (more positive).
     - Example: **CC(C)C(C)O** (branched alcohol) has **0.25505586**.
     - **CCCC** (butane) would likely have a higher value than smaller alkanes.

3. **Carbonyl Groups (Esters vs. Ketones/Acids)**:
   - Esters (**C(=O)OR**) tend to have moderately negative values unless balanced by other features.
     - Example: **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoate ester) has **-0.77871969**.
     - **COC=O** (methyl formate) also has **-0.77871969**.
   - Carboxylic acids (**C(=O)OH**) are more polar and likely to have lower values, but the given examples lack simple acids.

4. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups) vary widely but often have intermediate values.
     - Example: **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene) has **0.60627799**.
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetonitrile) has **-0.85287667**.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **ethyl hexanoate**, an ester with a 6-carbon aliphatic chain and an ethoxy group.
- Similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoate ester, **-0.77871969**) but with a shorter chain (6C vs. 9C) and an ethoxy group instead of methoxy.
- The shorter chain may slightly increase the value (less negative), but the ester group dominates.
- Another similar example: **COC=O** (methyl formate) has **-0.77871969**, but ethyl hexanoate has a longer nonpolar tail, which may offset the polarity slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the ester group and the moderately long aliphatic chain, the value is likely close to other esters in the examples, such as **-0.77871969**. However, the longer nonpolar tail may push it slightly higher (less negative). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65** (rounded from an intermediate value between **-0.77871969** and **-0.54761995** for similar esters).

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (approximate predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**).

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7856868747645065
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and halogenation. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`COC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is methyl benzoate, consisting of a benzoate ester (aromatic ring with an ester group: -COOCH3).

**Similar examples from the dataset:**  
1. `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate): **-0.78568687**  
   - Very similar structure, just with an ethyl group instead of methyl.  
2. `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate): **-0.25762624**  
   - Similar but with an added polar hydroxyl group, increasing the property value.  
3. `CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2`: **0.62571195**  
   - More complex structure with additional nitrogenous heterocycles, leading to a higher value.  

**Key observations:**  
- The ester group (`COC(=O)`) tends to pull the property value toward negative values (e.g., ethyl benzoate at **-0.78568687**).  
- The methyl group (`COC(=O)` instead of `CCOC(=O)`) is slightly less hydrophobic than ethyl, which might nudge the value slightly higher (less negative).  
- No additional polar or halogen substituents are present to significantly alter the value.  

**Prediction:**  
Given that ethyl benzoate is **-0.78568687**, methyl benzoate should be slightly less negative due to the shorter alkyl chain. A reasonable estimate would be close but slightly higher (e.g., **-0.75**).  

However, looking back at the first example in the dataset:  
`Cn1ccc(=O)[nH]c1=O` (a heterocyclic structure) has a value of **-0.75337696**, which is close to our estimate. Since methyl benzoate is simpler and lacks heteroatoms in the ring, its value might be slightly more negative than this but less negative than ethyl benzoate.  

**Final predicted property value:**  
**-0.77**  

*(This is an educated interpolation based on the given examples, assuming the property is related to logP or a similar physicochemical parameter.)*

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.7465839552885122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (but-2-ene): Property value = **-0.11057022**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property value = **-2.29367369**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): Property value = **-2.07644261**
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): Property value = **0.31156365**

   The presence of double bonds (especially conjugated systems) tends to lower the property value compared to saturated hydrocarbons. For example:
   - But-2-ene (one double bond) has a slightly negative value (-0.11).
   - Styrene (conjugated double bond + aromatic ring) has a much lower value (-2.29).

2. **1,3-Butadiene (C=CCC=C)**:
   - This is a conjugated diene (two double bonds separated by a single bond), which enhances electron delocalization. Based on the examples:
     - The property value is likely more negative than but-2-ene (-0.11) but less negative than styrene (-2.29) because it lacks an aromatic ring.
     - Conjugation typically reduces the property value further than isolated double bonds.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Propylbenzene (no conjugation, just an alkyl chain + aromatic ring) has a value of -2.07, but this is likely dominated by the aromatic ring.
   - But-2-ene (no conjugation) is at -0.11, so 1,3-butadiene (with conjugation) should be more negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **C=CCC=C** is between **-0.5 and -1.0**. A specific value close to **-0.6** seems plausible, considering the conjugation effect but no additional functional groups or rings.

**Final Prediction**: **-0.65**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trend; the actual value could vary slightly depending on the property's exact definition.)*

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.5096246397977673
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Bromine (Br)**: 
     - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (dibromonaphthalene-like): **-2.50083249**
     - `Ic1cccc2ccccc12` (iodobenzene-like): **-0.91604878**
     - `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (bromochlorotrifluoroethane): **0.91608871**
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**:
     - Highly chlorinated compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`): **0.83629949**
     - Less chlorinated (e.g., `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`): **-2.66362712**
   - **Fluorine (F)**:
     - `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`: **0.91608871** (highly halogenated, electronegative).

2. **Symmetry and Halogen Count**:
   - Highly symmetric, fully halogenated compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) tend to have **positive property values**.
   - Asymmetric or less halogenated compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) tend to have **negative property values**.

3. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a symmetric, fully brominated compound (similar to `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` but with Br instead of F/Cl).
   - The high electronegativity and symmetry of Br substituents suggest a **positive property value**, likely close to **0.91608871** (like `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`), but slightly lower due to Br being less electronegative than F.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the symmetry and high halogenation, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is approximately:

**0.85** (slightly lower than `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` due to Br's lower electronegativity). 

However, looking at the trend for fully brominated compounds (e.g., `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is **-2.50083249**), there might be a competing effect where bromine-heavy compounds can also have negative values. But **BrC(Br)Br** is more analogous to `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (symmetric, fully substituted), so a positive value is more likely.

### Final Answer:
**0.85** (estimated based on symmetry and halogenation trends). 

If forced to pick from the closest examples, I would lean toward **0.91608871** (like `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`), but conservatively **0.85** is a reasonable prediction.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.4889185457986062
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.16529198). This group tends to contribute moderately positive values.
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many examples, often associated with negative or near-zero values unless heavily substituted with electronegative atoms.
3. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: A cyclic amide (lactam) fused to an aromatic ring. Similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 0.36283843), which has a positive value.
4. **Chlorine substitution (C(CCl))**: Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** = 0.7511716).
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are polar but not strongly influential unless combined with other features.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines a phosphorothioate group (moderately positive), a lactam (positive), and a chlorine (positive), but also has neutral/negative contributions from the aromatic system and aliphatic chains.
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.16529198), but our molecule has an additional lactam and chlorine, which would likely increase the value slightly.
- Another similar example is **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (0.36283843), which has a lactam and chlorines but lacks the phosphorothioate group.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of moderately positive contributions from the phosphorothioate, lactam, and chlorine, but offset by the aromatic system, the property value is likely in the **low-to-mid positive range**. 

**Predicted property value: 0.45**

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.8065534639093149
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide group**: `CN(C)C(=O)N` (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` in the examples, which has a value of **-1.69031292**).
   - **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, which has a value of **-1.84701994**).
   - **Heterocyclic fragment with carbonyl**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` (somewhat similar to `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O` with a value of **0.13050997**, but with additional complexity).
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` (this is a sterically hindered group, which may slightly increase the property value compared to simpler alkyl groups).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The presence of the amide (`C(=O)N`) and chlorine on the aromatic ring suggests moderate polarity, similar to other polar-aromatic systems in the examples (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` with **-1.84701994**).
   - The heterocyclic `n2nc(oc2=O)` fragment introduces additional polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which may lower the property value slightly.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest matches are:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (**-1.69031292**): This lacks the aromatic and heterocyclic complexity but shares the amide group.
     - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (**-1.84701994**): This has a thiourea instead of an amide but shares the aromatic ring with a polar substituent.
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (**-1.84701994**): This has a nitro group instead of an amide but shares the chlorinated aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with values around **-1.69 to -1.85**, and considering the additional complexity of the heterocyclic fragment (which may slightly raise the value), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -1.75**  

This balances the effects of the amide, chlorine, and heterocyclic fragments, placing it between the two closest examples.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -1.8470199375809444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**: Property = -3.1873338 (highly negative)
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.41344854
   - **O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1**: Property = -2.2710298
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = 0.53874764 (unusually high for a chlorinated aromatic, likely due to multiple Cl and OH groups balancing polarity/electronic effects)

2. **Hydroxyl (OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.41344854 (one OH, two Cl)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = 0.53874764 (one OH, four Cl)
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**: Property = 0.4020452 (multiple OH groups increase property value)

3. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - The target molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
     - Two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen (O) bridge (similar to a diaryl ether).
     - Three chlorine (Cl) substitutions (two on one ring, one on the other).
     - Two hydroxyl (OH) groups (one on each ring).
   - This is structurally similar to **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** but with a more extended conjugated system and fewer Cl substitutions per ring.

### Prediction:
- The presence of two OH groups and three Cl atoms suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing (Cl) and electron-donating (OH) effects, leading to moderate polarity.
- The diaryl ether linkage adds some flexibility but doesn't drastically alter the property compared to simpler chlorinated phenols.
- Comparing to **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (0.53874764), the target molecule has fewer Cl atoms but an extra OH group and extended conjugation, likely reducing the property slightly.

### Estimated Property:
Given the structural similarities and trends, the predicted property for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is approximately:  
**-0.2 to 0.2**.  

A refined estimate based on the closest examples is:  
**0.15** (closer to the less chlorinated but hydroxyl-rich examples).  

However, considering the diaryl ether linkage's slight negative contribution (as seen in other extended systems), a final prediction is:  
**0.05**.  

But reviewing **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.41344854) and adding another OH and Cl-substituted ring, the value likely increases slightly but remains in the same range.  

Thus, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.1**.  

### Final Answer:
**-0.1** (approximate, based on structural analogies).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples' trends.)  

---

**Correction after re-evaluating**:  
Given that **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a higher value (0.53874764) despite more Cl atoms, the target molecule's extra OH and symmetry may push it closer to **0.2**.  

**Revised Prediction**: **0.2**.  

(But the true value depends on the property's definition, which isn't specified here.)  

For consistency with the closest examples, the predicted property is:  
**0.15**.

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.11057022071113204
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value for the molecule **CC/C=C\C** (which is equivalent to **CC=CC**, or 2-butene) can be inferred by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset.

1. **CC/C=C/C** (a similar molecule, likely 2-butene or a related alkene) has a property value of **-0.11057022**.
2. **CC=CC** (the given molecule) is structurally very similar, differing only in stereochemistry (cis/trans), but the dataset does not strongly differentiate between them in terms of property values for simple alkenes.

Since the property values for simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes) in the dataset tend to cluster around certain values (e.g., **CCCC** would likely be similar to **CC=CC**), and given that **CC/C=C/C** is already in the dataset with a value of **-0.11057022**, the property for **CC/C=C\C** (the trans or cis form) should be very close.

### Predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C**:  
**-0.11057022** (same as the provided **CC/C=C/C** example, as the difference in stereochemistry is unlikely to significantly alter the property in this context).  

If the dataset had shown larger variations for cis/trans isomers, we might adjust slightly, but here the simplest assumption is that the value is the same.
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aliphatic ethers (e.g., CCOC) tend to have property values around 0.25-0.31
2. The presence of oxygen in an ether linkage (R-O-R') generally contributes positively to the property
3. The property value seems to decrease slightly with increasing chain length
4. Branching doesn't significantly affect the value for simple ethers/alcohols (compare CC(C)O and CCC(O)CC both at 0.255)

For the molecule CCCOCC (diethyl ether):
- It's a simple aliphatic ether like CCOC (dimethyl ether), but with slightly longer chains
- The property value should be similar to other simple ethers/alcohols in the dataset
- Most similar compounds in the dataset have values around 0.255

Given that CC(C)O = 0.255 and CCC(O)CC = 0.255, and considering CCCOCC is structurally similar (just an oxygen between two alkyl chains instead of an alcohol), the most reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value for CCCOCC: 0.25505586**

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.8158847907305384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can influence the property.
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are hydrophobic and aromatic.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.15391546): This is a simple biphenyl derivative with no polar groups. The addition of polar amide and bulky tert-butyl in our molecule would likely decrease the property value further.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property: 0.91425277): This has a similar tertiary amide and phenyl rings but also includes a heterocyclic group (thiazole), which increases the property value significantly. Our molecule lacks such heterocycles, so its value should be lower.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (property: -0.25762624): This has an amide and aromatic ring but is less bulky. Our molecule's additional phenyl ring and tert-butyl group would likely push the property closer to zero or slightly negative.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Bulky hydrophobic groups (e.g., tert-butyl, phenyl rings) tend to reduce the property value (e.g., **CC(C)=CCCC(O)(C)C=C** has -0.88030252).
   - Tertiary amides with aromatic rings (e.g., **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3**) can increase the property, but our molecule lacks the heterocyclic component, so the effect is muted.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar amide (slight positive contribution) and the bulky hydrophobic groups (negative contribution), the property value is likely **close to zero but slightly negative**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.25** (similar to **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** but adjusted for the additional phenyl ring and tert-butyl group). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.25**

To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with small substituents (e.g., Br, Cl, CH3) tend to have property values around **-0.5 to 0.0** (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 = 0.0, Fc1cccc(Br)c1 = -0.342).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Br) often have slightly negative values (e.g., O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 = -0.575, Fc1cccc(Br)c1 = -0.342).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH2) tend to have more negative values (e.g., Cc1ccc(O)cc1C = -3.187, Cc1ccc(N)cc1 = -3.187).

2. **Amide Groups (-NHC=O)**:
   - The presence of an amide group (e.g., CONH) often reduces the property value. For example:
     - C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 = -0.961 (cyclic amide).
     - CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 = 0.816 (tertiary amide with aromatic rings).

3. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine on an aromatic ring tends to give values around **-0.3 to -0.7** (e.g., Fc1cccc(Br)c1 = -0.342, Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 = -0.685).

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** has:
     - An aromatic ring with a bromine substituent (expected ~ -0.5 to -0.7).
     - An amide group (CONH) attached to the aromatic ring (expected to reduce the value further, similar to other amides).
     - No strongly electron-donating groups (like OH or NH2), so the value won't be as negative as -3.187.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely in the range of **-0.7 to -1.0**, balancing the effects of the bromine and the amide group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 = -0.685, and amide-containing molecules like C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 = -0.961).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.85**

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -2.0764426125635214
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Alkyl-substituted benzene rings** tend to have negative property values, especially when the alkyl group is small (e.g., methyl or ethyl). Examples:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N**: -3.1873338 (methyl + amino group)
   - **Cc1ccnc(C)c1**: -2.94903331 (methyl + nitrogen in ring)
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1**: -2.29367369 (vinyl group)
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**: -2.07644261 (ethyl + methyl substitution)
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: -2.07644261 (isopropyl + methyl substitution)

2. **Branched alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl)** attached to benzene rings seem to align with the trend of smaller alkyl groups, yielding moderately negative values (around -2.0 to -2.3).

3. The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an **isopropyl group attached to a benzene ring**, similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (which has an additional methyl substitution and a value of -2.07644261). The absence of the extra methyl in **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** might slightly reduce the magnitude of the negative value.

4. Other molecules with isopropyl groups (but not attached to benzene) have positive values (e.g., **CC(C)CO**: 0.25505586), suggesting the benzene ring is the dominant factor for negative values.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-2.07644261) but with one fewer substituent, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely slightly less negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.9 to -2.0**

For specificity, we can approximate:  
**-1.95** (interpolating between the trends of simpler and more substituted cases). 

However, looking at the closest match (**CCc1ccc(C)cc1** and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** both at -2.076), the value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely very similar. Thus, a precise prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -2.07644261** (same as the closely related examples). 

### Final Answer:
**-2.07644261**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -1.7046140959402005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): -3.1873338  
     (Methoxy group on benzene)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polycyclic aromatic): 1.0756821  
     (Large conjugated system increases the property)
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (fluorene-like): -0.15391546  
     (Fused aromatic rings with no polar groups)

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Aromatics**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (paracetamol-like): -0.25762624  
     (Amide + hydroxyl on benzene)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: 1.09075362  
     (Two aromatic rings with carbonyl groups)
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: -1.63897238  
     (Complex carbonyl-containing structure)

3. **Simple Aldehydes/Ketones**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1**: -2.94903331  
     (Cyclic ketone with alkene)
   - **CC(=O)CCC**: -0.25302082  
     (Linear ketone)

### Analysis of **O=Cc1ccccc1** (Benzaldehyde):
- It has a **benzene ring + aldehyde group (-CHO)**.
- The aldehyde is polar and conjugated with the aromatic ring, which may lower the property value compared to non-polar aromatics but not as drastically as electron-donating groups (e.g., -OCH3 in anisole, which has a very low value of -3.187).
- Similar molecules:
  - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-0.2576): Amide + hydroxyl (more polar than benzaldehyde).
  - **CC(=O)CCC** (-0.2530): Linear ketone (less conjugated than benzaldehyde).

### Prediction:
Benzaldehyde is less polar than amides or alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons. Its conjugation slightly reduces the property value compared to simpler aromatics. From the examples, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -1.0**.  

A precise prediction based on the closest analogs is:  
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: -0.75**  

*(This is an interpolation between the ketone/amide examples and simpler aromatics.)*

**Final Answer: -0.75**

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 1.1564503281046343
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - Two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), which are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
     - A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
     - A furan-like ring (**c1ccc(o1)**), which is aromatic but less electron-rich than benzene due to the oxygen heteroatom.
     - A conjugated system linking the nitro group to the amide groups, which may influence electronic properties.

2. **Similarity to Provided Examples**:
   - The presence of the nitro group is seen in **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = 0.22267287), where the nitro group is attached to an aromatic system. This suggests that nitro groups in aromatic contexts tend to contribute to moderately positive property values.
   - The amide groups are present in molecules like **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.81588479), where multiple amides contribute to a higher property value.
   - The furan-like ring is less common in the examples, but aromatic heterocycles with oxygen (e.g., **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**) tend to have negative or low-positive property values.

3. **Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which could lower the property value if it dominates.
   - The amide groups are polar but can also participate in resonance, potentially offsetting the nitro group's effect.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is medium-sized with a fused ring system, similar to **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23** (property = 0.86154198), which has a high property value due to extensive conjugation. However, the nitro group here may counteract this.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the polar amide groups, along with the aromatic heterocycle, the property value is likely to be in the low-to-moderate positive range. A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.5**, similar to molecules with mixed polar and aromatic features.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.52**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.4648197111954498
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds** tend to have negative property values, especially when nitrogen is part of an aromatic system (e.g., pyridine, aniline, or diazo groups).
   - Example: `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has a very negative value of **-3.1873338**.
   - Example: `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (a diazo compound) has a moderately positive value of **0.46481971**.

2. The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a **diphenylamine derivative**, where two phenyl rings are connected via a nitrogen atom. This is structurally similar to the diazo compound `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, but without the double-bonded nitrogen (=N).

3. The presence of **two aromatic rings** with **nitrogen linkage** suggests a less negative (or slightly positive) property compared to simple aniline, but not as positive as the diazo compound.

### Comparison:
- `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline): **-3.1873338**
- `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diazo): **0.46481971**
- **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine): Likely intermediate between these two.

### Prediction:
Given that diphenylamine lacks the strongly electron-withdrawing =N group (unlike the diazo compound) but is less negative than aniline, a reasonable estimate is slightly negative or near zero. 

From the examples, a similar structure is `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (**0.46481971**), but without the =N, the property should be less positive. 

Thus, the predicted property for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately:  
**-0.2 to 0.2**. 

A specific value based on the trend could be:  
**0.1**. 

However, considering the strong negative influence of aromatic nitrogens (like in aniline), a more conservative estimate might be closer to zero or slightly negative. 

Given the examples, a refined prediction is:  
**-0.1**. 

But since the diazo analogue is **0.46481971**, and this lacks the =N, splitting the difference suggests:  
**0.2**. 

After reconsidering, the most plausible value based on the given data is:  
**0.1**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**0.1**.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.5476199529516287
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) in a cyclic structure (a diketopiperazine-like core). 
   - It also has a cyclohexane ring (**CCCC1**) fused to the diketopiperazine.

2. **Polarity/Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically increases solubility or interaction potential. 
   - The cyclohexane ring adds hydrophobic character.

3. **Similar Examples from Given Data**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property: **-0.54761995**): This is a similar cyclic diamide with hydrophobic side chains. The property is moderately negative.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property: **-0.96081988**): Another cyclic diamide with alkyl substituents, showing a more negative value.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property: **-0.77871969**): A simpler lactam (cyclic amide), also with a negative value.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - Cyclic amides/diamides in the given data tend to have negative property values, likely due to balanced polarity/hydrophobicity.
   - The presence of the cyclohexane ring (more hydrophobic than alkyl chains) may push the value slightly higher (less negative) compared to **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** but lower than **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to cyclic diamides with hydrophobic components, the property value is expected to be in the range of **-0.5 to -0.8**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65** (interpolating between the similar examples).

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**).

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -1.448389493771743
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.0**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **0.14969597**.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked by a single bond, with chlorine substituents). 
   - It is less chlorinated than the second example above but more chlorinated than simple dichlorobenzene.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Increasing chlorination tends to increase the property value slightly (e.g., dichlorobenzene = 0.0, heavily chlorinated biphenyl = 0.14969597).
   - The biphenyl core itself (without substituents) would likely have a value close to 0.0, but chlorination adds a small positive increment.

### Prediction:
Given that the target molecule is a **dichlorinated biphenyl**, its property value should be **slightly higher than 0.0 but lower than 0.14969597**. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.1**, considering the intermediate level of chlorination.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is **0.1**. 

*(Note: This is an approximate prediction based on structural analogies and trends in the provided data. For precise calculations, computational or experimental methods would be required.)*

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -2.0764426125635214
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): Property = -3.1873338  
     (Aromatic ring with a small alkyl group and an amino group; highly negative value.)
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = -2.07644261  
     (Aromatic ring with a long alkyl chain; less negative than methylaniline but still negative.)
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not explicitly given, but similar to methylaniline without the N, likely negative.
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): Property = -2.94903331  
     (Aromatic heterocycle with an ethyl group; very negative.)

2. **Symmetry and Branching**:
   - Symmetric or branched alkyl substituents (e.g., diethyl, isopropyl) tend to have less negative values than linear alkyl chains or single small substituents.

3. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a benzene ring with two ethyl groups (symmetrically substituted).  
   - Compared to hexylbenzene (single long alkyl chain, -2.076), diethylbenzene has two shorter alkyl chains, which may reduce the negative impact.  
   - Compared to ethylpyridine (-2.949), replacing the heteroatom (N in the ring) with a pure hydrocarbon structure (benzene) and adding symmetry (two ethyl groups) should make the property less negative.

4. **Estimated Property**:
   - The value is likely between hexylbenzene (-2.076) and symmetric/aliphatic molecules like **CCCCOC** (0.255) or **CCCC(=O)OC** (-0.779).  
   - Since diethylbenzene is purely hydrocarbon and symmetric, I expect it to be less negative than hexylbenzene but still negative due to the aromatic + alkyl nature.  
   - A reasonable estimate is **-1.5 to -0.5**. Looking at similar symmetric/disubstituted examples, I lean toward **-0.8 to -1.2**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is:  
**-1.07644261**  

(This is close to hexylbenzene but adjusted for symmetry and shorter alkyl chains.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -2.0073908651204455
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline group (Nc1ccccc1)** with a **sulfonamide (S(N)(=O)=O)** substituent on the aromatic ring. 
   - The sulfonamide group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both donor and acceptor), which may lower the property value.
   - The aromatic ring contributes to hydrophobicity, but the polar substituents counteract this.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property: **-0.11468719**): This is nitroaniline, which has a polar nitro group (similar in polarity to sulfonamide). The sulfonamide is even more polar due to additional hydrogen bonding capability, so the property value might be slightly lower.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property: **0.0138071**): This is adenine, a polar heterocycle. The sulfonamide-aniline is likely more polar, so the value should be lower.
   - **Oc1ccncc1** (property: **-2.19092298**): This is pyridinol, highly polar due to the OH group. The sulfonamide-aniline is less polar than this, so the value should be higher.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)N**: The sulfonamide is bulkier and more polar than a nitro group, so the value should be lower than nitroaniline but not as extreme as pyridinol.

3. **Electronic Effects**:
   - The sulfonamide group is electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro, but with additional hydrogen bonding. This likely reduces the property value further than nitroaniline.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the value should be between **-0.11468719** (nitroaniline) and **-0.63176382** (iodo-substituted polar aromatic). A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than nitroaniline due to the sulfonamide's greater polarity.

**Predicted Property Value: -0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that more polar/charged groups tend to correlate with lower values in the given examples.) 

---
**Final Answer: -0.25** (estimated based on structural similarity and polarity trends).  

---
*Note: For precise predictions, the actual property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.) would need to be specified, and a more rigorous method (like group contribution or QSAR) would be required. This is a heuristic approximation.*

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.6039355761371415
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (specifically, it is **triphenylene**). 

Key features:
1. Fully conjugated aromatic system (highly planar and delocalized π-electrons).
2. No heteroatoms (only carbon and hydrogen).
3. No substituents (no halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, etc.).

### Comparison with Given Examples:
From the provided data, similar fully conjugated aromatic systems (PAHs) have the following property values:
- **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**: 0.86154198  
  (A PAH with 4 fused rings, similar complexity but with a methyl substituent.)
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**: 1.0756821  
  (A larger PAH with 5 fused rings, no substituents.)
- **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32**: 0.28060423  
  (A smaller PAH with 3 fused rings and a methyl substituent.)

### Observations:
1. Larger, fully conjugated PAHs tend to have **higher property values** (e.g., 0.86154198 and 1.0756821 for 4-5 fused rings).
2. Substituents like halogens or methyl groups can slightly alter the value, but the **core aromatic system dominates**.
3. The given molecule is **smaller than the 5-ring PAH but larger than the 3-ring PAH**, so its value should be **between 0.28 and 1.07**, likely closer to the 4-ring PAH (0.86).

### Prediction:
Given its **fully conjugated, unsubstituted 4-ring structure**, the predicted property value is:  
**≈ 0.90** (interpolating between the 4-ring and 5-ring examples).

### Final Answer:
**0.90** (estimated based on structural similarity to given PAH examples).

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.2784695176726106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) attached to aromatic rings (phenolic groups).
   - A ketone (**C=O**) in a cyclic structure.
   - Ether linkage (**-O-** between rings).
   - Extended conjugated system (aromatic rings linked with partial saturation).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The molecule is highly polar due to multiple **-OH** groups and a **C=O**, suggesting significant hydrogen bonding capacity.
   - Similar to molecules like **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (property: 0.4400802) or **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (property: -1.30347995), but with more complexity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple **-OH** groups (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1**) tend to have negative property values (here: -1.30347995), likely due to high polarity or solubility effects.
   - However, the presence of a **C=O** and additional aromatic systems (like in **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**) can offset this, leading to less negative or positive values.
   - The given molecule is larger and more conjugated than **Oc1cccc(O)c1**, which may reduce the negative contribution of the **-OH** groups.

4. **Property Trend**:
   - The property seems to correlate with **balance between polar groups and hydrophobic/aromatic regions**. 
   - Here, the **-OH** groups dominate, but the extended conjugation and ketone may mitigate this, placing the value closer to zero than highly negative examples like **Fc1ccccc1** (-2.94903331).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (0.4400802) but with more **-OH** groups (pulling the value down) and no halogens (which often increase the property), a reasonable estimate is slightly negative but less so than **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-1.30347995). 

**Predicted property value: -0.75**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, likely between -1.0 and -0.5.)*  

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is a heuristic prediction. The value is inferred from the trend that **more -OH groups reduce the property**, while **aromaticity and C=O groups increase it**. For a precise prediction, the actual property being modeled would need to be specified.

   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.827). 
   - The presence of **P=O or P=S** seems to increase the property value, especially when combined with electronegative atoms (Cl, S, O).

2. **Thioether (S-C) and Thioester (S-C=O) groups**:
   - Molecules with sulfur (e.g., **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1**) often have **negative values** (e.g., -1.989), but when combined with phosphorus (e.g., **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**), the value becomes positive (0.405).

3. **Amide (NC=O) groups**:
   - Amides (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.575), but when part of a larger polar/charged system (e.g., phosphorus or nitro groups), the effect may be offset.

4. **Combination of P=O, S-C, and NC=O**:
   - The molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
     - A **phosphate group (P=O)** (positive contribution).
     - A **thioether (S-C)** (negative contribution, but less dominant when P=O is present).
     - An **amide (NC=O)** (negative contribution, but likely mitigated by the phosphate group).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = 0.404): 
  - Contains P=O and Cl/aryl groups (positive contribution).
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = 0.827): 
  - Contains P=S and Cl/aryl groups (higher positive value).
- **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** lacks Cl but has S-C and NC=O, which may reduce the positive effect of P=O slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of:
- **P=O** (positive contribution, ~0.4–0.8 range),
- **S-C** (slight negative contribution, but less impactful here),
- **NC=O** (negative, but offset by P=O),

The predicted property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is likely in the **middle-positive range**, similar to **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.404)** but slightly lower due to the absence of Cl and presence of NC=O.

### Final Prediction:
**0.35** (approximate, based on structural analogies). 

(Note: Without a clear quantitative model, this is an educated estimate based on the examples.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.6910822260829964
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I can predict its property value based on structural features and trends observed in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Halogenated Compounds (Cl/Br)**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene-like) has a **positive value (0.53874764)**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a **negative value (-0.41344854)**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a **very negative value (-1.44838949)**.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a **high positive value (0.84541603)**.

   Halogens (Cl/Br) can contribute to positive or negative values depending on the rest of the structure. Simple halogenated alkanes/alkenes tend to have moderately positive values unless paired with strongly negative groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂).

2. **Alkenes**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene) has a **negative value (-0.11057022)**.
   - **CCC=O** (butanal) has a **negative value (-0.25302082)**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C** (alkene-containing heterocycle) has a **near-zero value (0.0138071)**.

   Pure alkenes (without polar groups) tend to have slightly negative or near-zero values.

3. **Symmetry and Small Molecules**:
   - Small, symmetric molecules like **CC1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) have **positive values (0.31156365)**.
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is small and symmetric (trans-dichloroethene), which may push the value toward neutral or slightly positive.

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- It is a small, symmetric alkene with two chlorines.
- Chlorines are electronegative but not as strongly deactivating as -OH or -NH₂.
- No strongly negative groups are present.
- Similar to **CCBr** (bromoethane), which has a high positive value, but the double bond may reduce this slightly.

Given these trends, the predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is likely **moderately positive**, around **0.3 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.35** (specific example: similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** but slightly lower due to smaller size). 

However, looking more closely, **CCBr** (bromoethane) is a closer analog (simple halogenated hydrocarbon), and its value is **0.84541603**. Since **Cl\C=C/Cl** is more polarizable due to the double bond and chlorines, but smaller, I'd adjust downward. 

Final prediction: **0.40**. 

But to match the dataset's precision, I'll round to **0.4**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (0.538) is heavily chlorinated, so **Cl\C=C/Cl** would likely be lower. 

Given **CCBr** is 0.845 and **CC1CCCC1** is 0.311, **Cl\C=C/Cl** is likely between these. 

Final answer: **0.45**. 

But to be precise, let's average the closest analogs: 

- **CCBr**: 0.845  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c...**: 0.538  
- **CC1CCCC1**: 0.311  

Average of 0.538 and 0.311 is ~0.42. 

So, **Predicted value: 0.42**. 

But the exact value is hard to pin down; the closest estimate is **0.40**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll provide the final predicted value as:  

**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: 0.40**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on structural analogs in the dataset. The true value may vary slightly, but 0.40 is a reasonable prediction.)  

However, looking back at **CC1CCCC1** (0.311) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)...** (0.538), **Cl\C=C/Cl** is simpler than the latter but more polarizable than the former, so **0.40** is a good compromise.  

**Final answer: 0.40**.
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -2.9490333051900164
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative or low positive values unless heavily substituted with halogens or other electronegative groups.
     - Example: `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) has a value of **-3.1873338**.
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2ccccc2` (chlorinated biphenyl) also has **-3.1873338**.
   - Nitrogen-containing aromatics (e.g., pyridine-like structures) often have values closer to zero or slightly positive unless other functional groups dominate.
     - Example: `Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` (a diazole derivative) has **-0.11468719**.
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (a fused nitrogen heterocycle) has **0.46481971**.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) increase the property value (e.g., `BrC(Cl)Cl` has **1.28628951**).
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., OH, CO) can decrease or increase the value depending on context (e.g., `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` has **-1.44838949**).

3. **Pyridine-Specific Examples**:
   - No exact pyridine example is given, but similar nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2`, a diazole) have values around **0.22267287** or **-0.11468719**.
   - Pyridine is less electron-rich than benzene due to the electronegative nitrogen, which may slightly increase the property value compared to benzene derivatives.

### Prediction for **c1ccncc1** (Pyridine):
- Pyridine is a simple nitrogen-containing aromatic ring with no additional substituents. Based on the examples:
  - Benzene derivatives with no substituents or simple substituents (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1`) have very negative values (**-3.1873338**).
  - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles without strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups tend to have values closer to zero (e.g., **-0.11468719** to **0.22267287**).
  - Pyridine's nitrogen is moderately electron-withdrawing, which may raise the value slightly compared to benzene but not as much as halogens or other polar groups.

Given these trends, the predicted property value for pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is likely in the range of **-0.1 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.0** (or very close to zero, e.g., **0.05** if interpolating between similar examples). 

However, since the closest analogous examples (`Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` and `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) have values of **-0.11468719** and **0.22267287**, respectively, and pyridine is simpler, a conservative estimate is:

**Final predicted value: -0.1** (rounded to one decimal place). 

For specificity, we can assign:  
**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.11468719** (matching the closest nitrogen-containing heterocycle example). 

However, since pyridine is simpler than the diazole examples, a slightly more negative value may be appropriate (e.g., **-0.2**). 

Given the data, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.1**. 

But to match the granularity of the examples, we'll select the closest value from the training set:  
**-0.11468719**. 

Thus:  
**Predicted value: -0.11468719**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on structural similarity.)

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** is **-0.11468719**.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.1276696135844901
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Ether and Alcohol**: `OCC(O)CO` – Similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = -0.07263608), but shorter.
   - **Ester**: `COC(=O)` – Present in molecules like `CCOC(=O)CC` (property = -0.77871969) and `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = 0.30861018). Esters can vary widely, but aromatic esters tend to have higher values.
   - **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**: `c1ccccc1N` – Aniline-like, similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (property = -0.25762624).
   - **Chlorinated Aromatic System**: `Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23` – Chlorine on an aromatic ring, similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property = 0.60627799) or `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (property = 0.14969597). Chlorine typically increases the property value.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule combines polar groups (alcohol, ester, aniline) with a chlorinated aromatic system.
   - Chlorine and aromaticity tend to increase the property value, while aliphatic chains and simple esters decrease it.
   - The presence of multiple polar and aromatic fragments suggests a moderate to high property value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (property = 0.81588479): This has two aromatic amides, similar to our molecule's ester and aniline.
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property = 0.60627799): Chlorine on an aromatic ring, like our molecule.
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = 0.30861018): Aromatic ester, similar to our ester fragment.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of an aromatic ester, aniline, and chlorinated aromatic system, the property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.65**  

This balances the contributions from the ester (slightly negative), aniline (moderate), and chlorine (positive).

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -2.07644261
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): -2.07644261
   - **CCCCCCCI** (heptyl iodide): 1.05438158
   - Hydrocarbon chains with no polar groups tend to have negative values (around -2.0 to -0.2).

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): -0.77871969
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): -0.77871969
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): 0.25505586
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): 0.25505586
   - Alcohols (OH groups) tend to shift the property value toward positive values compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer chains or branching don't drastically change the property if the functional group is the same (e.g., **OC1CCCCCCC1** and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** both have the same value).
   - The presence of an OH group seems to dominate the effect.

4. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - Molecules with OH groups (hydrogen bond donors) tend to have higher (less negative) values than hydrocarbons or ethers.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- This is a linear alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a terminal OH group.
- Similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol), which both have a value of **0.25505586**.
- The linear chain may slightly reduce the value compared to cyclic or branched alcohols, but the OH group's effect is dominant.
- The value is likely close to the other alcohols in the dataset.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is **0.25505586**.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.28060423144422025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`), which is common in many of the examples. Aromatic rings often contribute negatively to the property (e.g., `-2.076` for `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1`).
2. **Sulfonyl Group**: The `S(=O)(=O)` group is polar and electronegative. Similar sulfonyl-containing molecules (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with `-2.663`) suggest a negative contribution.
3. **Amide Group**: The `C(=O)N` group is present, which is also polar. Amides in the examples (e.g., `CCC(Br)(CC)C(=O)NC(N)=O` with `-0.952`) tend to lower the property.
4. **Heterocycle with Oxygen**: The `CCO1` ring is a 5-membered heterocycle with oxygen. Similar heterocycles (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with `0.0`) can have neutral or slightly negative effects.
5. **Methyl Group**: The `CC` substituent is nonpolar but doesn't significantly increase the property (e.g., `CCCC(=O)CCC` with `-0.253`).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of aromatic sulfonamides and heterocyclic structures. Examples like `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` (`-4.632`) and `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (`0.464`) show that polar/aromatic systems can vary widely.
- The sulfonyl and amide groups likely dominate, pushing the property toward negative values.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of the aromatic ring, sulfonyl, and amide groups, a reasonable estimate is **-1.5**. This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., `-1.303` for `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` and `-1.353` for `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2`).

True Property: 1.4420243546272438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system with a nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Examples with nitro groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have property values around **-0.575**.
   - Nitro groups are electron-withdrawing and often reduce the property value.

2. **Ester groups (C(=O)OC)**:
   - Esters are polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro groups. Examples with esters (e.g., `CCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC`) have values around **0.308**.

3. **Substituted aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**:
   - Aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-2.076** for simple alkyl substitutions).

4. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (NC=)**:
   - Nitrogen in a ring (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2`) contributes to negative values (e.g., **-1.038**).

5. **Branching and sterics**:
   - The molecule has branching (methyl groups) and steric hindrance, which can slightly increase the value compared to linear analogs.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule combines a nitro group, ester groups, and an aromatic system, similar to `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (**-0.575**) but with additional ester contributions (~**0.3**) and heterocyclic nitrogen (~**-1.0**).
- The net effect is likely a balance between the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the ester contributions.

### Predicted Property:
Given the competing effects, the predicted value is approximately:  
**-0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural analogies. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.5476199529516287
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure with a fused cyclopropane ring.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors). 
   - The cyclopropane ring adds rigidity but is nonpolar.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, alcohols) tend to have lower property values (e.g., **c1ccncc1** with pyridine has -2.949, **OCc1ccccc1** with phenol has -2.501). 
   - Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** with sugar-like rings) have values around 0.0 when balanced by polarity.
   - Imide-like structures (e.g., **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) have intermediate values (-0.632).

4. **Unique Features**:
   - The cyclopropane fused to the imide ring adds strain but no additional polarity. 
   - The symmetry and lack of aromaticity or large hydrophobic regions suggest a moderate property value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar amides and the nonpolar cyclopropane, the property value is likely **close to 0.0**, similar to other rigid, polar-but-symmetric structures. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.25** (slightly negative due to the net polarity of the amides). 

However, comparing to the imide example (**ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, -0.632), this molecule is less polar and more symmetric, so a less negative value is expected.  

**Final Prediction: -0.40** (interpolated between 0.0 and the imide example).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on the trend of polar vs. nonpolar features in the examples.)*

**Answer: -0.40**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.6599390504278075
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **ClCC** (chloroethane):

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes with Halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.65477605
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): 0.7511716
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodobenzene): 0.60627799
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (a polychlorinated hydrocarbon): 1.38514035

   Halogenated aromatics tend to have property values in the range of -0.65 to +1.38, with more halogens increasing the value.

2. **Simple Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): 0.31156365
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): 0.31156365
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.11057022

   Simple alkanes/alkenes have values around 0.31 (for alkanes) or slightly negative (for alkenes).

3. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCC** is a simple chlorinated alkane (chloroethane). No exact example is given, but we can interpolate:
     - Chlorobenzene (aromatic) is -0.65477605.
     - Simple alkanes are ~0.31.
     - Adding a chlorine to an alkane likely reduces the property value compared to the parent alkane but not as much as in an aromatic system.

### Prediction for **ClCC**:
- The property value for **CCCCC** (pentane) is 0.31156365.
- Adding a chlorine (electron-withdrawing) would likely reduce this value, but not as drastically as in aromatic systems (where resonance effects play a role).
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly less than the alkane value but not as low as chlorobenzene.

Given the examples, a plausible prediction for **ClCC** is:  
**-0.25** (approximately between the alkane value and chlorobenzene).

However, looking at the trend more carefully:
- **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene, unsaturated) is -0.11057022.
- **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) is -0.65477605.
- **ClCC** is simpler than chlorobenzene, so its value should be closer to the alkane/alkene range.

A refined estimate is:  
**-0.15** (slightly negative due to the chlorine but not as much as in conjugated/aromatic systems).

### Final Predicted Property Value for **ClCC**:  
**-0.15** (approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the provided data trends.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.6807856096970376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values (e.g., `ClCC(Cl)Cl` = 1.15796831, `BrC(Cl)Cl` = 1.28628951). 
   - The presence of a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) group is associated with higher values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 0.14969597, though this also has aromatic rings reducing the effect).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitrogen (e.g., `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` = -0.78568687) tend to lower the property value, but chlorine substitution can counteract this.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has:
     - A chlorinated aromatic ring (`Clc1cccc(n1)`).
     - A trichloromethyl group (`C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).
     - A nitrogen in the aromatic ring (pyridine-like structure), which might slightly reduce the property value compared to pure chloroaromatics.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (property = 0.14969597): This has two aromatic rings and a trichloromethyl group. The additional aromaticity reduces the property compared to simpler chloroalkanes.
- `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (property = 1.15796831): A simple chloroalkane with high value.
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = -1.44838949): This has two chlorinated aromatic rings but no trichloromethyl group, leading to a negative value.

### Prediction:
The molecule `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has:
1. A pyridine ring with chlorine substitution (reducing effect due to nitrogen).
2. A trichloromethyl group (strong increasing effect).

The trichloromethyl group likely dominates, but the nitrogen in the ring will offset some of the increase. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (0.14969597) but lower than `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (1.15796831). 

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (approximate, based on balancing the effects of the trichloromethyl group and the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring). 

This is consistent with the trend where trichloromethyl groups increase the value, but aromatic nitrogen reduces it compared to pure chloroalkanes.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with a similar structure to **CCCCC(C)O** (a branched alcohol with a medium-length carbon chain) tends to cluster around **0.255**. For instance:

- **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear heptanol) = **0.25505586**  
- **CCC(C)CCO** (branched hexanol) = **0.25505586**  
- **CCC(CC)CO** (another branched hexanol) = **0.25505586**  

These examples suggest that the property is relatively consistent for aliphatic alcohols with 6-7 carbons, regardless of minor branching differences.  

### Predicted Property for **CCCCC(C)O**:  
**0.255** (matching the trend observed in structurally similar molecules).  

This aligns with the apparent insensitivity of the property to slight branching variations in this molecular class.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.5387476438298863
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl-like structure) has a property value of **-3.1873338**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) is not explicitly listed, but similar halogenated aromatics with multiple halogens tend to have negative values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** is likely similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**, which has **-0.41344854**).
   - **Bromine vs. Chlorine**: Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, but the effect on the property may not be drastically different if the substitution pattern is similar.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - The molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is para-substituted (1,4-dibromobenzene), similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene). The latter is not explicitly in the examples, but **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol) has a value of **-0.41344854**, suggesting that para-substituted dihalogenated aromatics may fall in this range.
   - The presence of two bromines (heavier halogens) might push the value slightly more negative than chlorine due to increased polarizability.

3. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (highly chlorinated) has **-0.41344854**, suggesting that multiple halogens don't always make the value extremely negative unless conjugated with other features (e.g., **-3.1873338** for the biphenyl-like structure).
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** lacks extended conjugation or additional functional groups, so it likely won't reach the extreme negative values seen in some examples.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is most similar to para-substituted dihalogenated aromatics, and its property value is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.5387476438298863
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value tends to increase with the number of halogen atoms (Cl, Br) and aromatic rings in the molecule. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and contains two aromatic rings, similar to the second example in the list:

**Example molecule:**  
`Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`  
**Property value:** `1.4545452`

The new molecule is:  
`Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl`

### Comparison:
1. Both molecules have two aromatic rings connected directly.
2. Both are heavily chlorinated, but the new molecule has slightly fewer chlorine atoms (7 Cl) compared to the example (9 Cl).
3. The example molecule has a fully chlorinated structure (all possible positions on the rings are substituted with Cl), while the new molecule has some unsubstituted positions (e.g., `cc` in the second ring).

### Prediction:
Since the new molecule is structurally similar but has fewer chlorine atoms, its property value should be slightly lower than the example. The example has a value of `1.4545452`, so the new molecule's value should be in the same range but slightly reduced.

**Predicted property value:** `1.40` (approximate, likely between `1.35` and `1.45` based on the trend).

For a more precise estimate, I would predict:  
**`1.4028496`** (same as the first example, which also has high chlorination but fewer total Cl atoms). However, since this molecule is more chlorinated than the first example but less than the second, a value closer to the second but slightly lower seems reasonable.

Final prediction:  
**`1.42`** (interpolating between the two closest examples). 

But given the data, the most consistent answer is likely:  
**`1.4028496`** (same as `ClC(Br)Br` but adjusted for aromaticity and chlorination). 

However, this seems too low. Re-evaluating, the correct prediction should be closer to the second example but slightly lower, so:  
**`1.42`**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll round to:  
**`1.4028496`** (same as the first example, as the new molecule is intermediate between the first and second examples in chlorination). 

After reconsidering, the best fit is:  
**`1.42`**. 

But the examples suggest exact values, so I'll stick with:  
**`1.4028496`**. 

Final answer:  
**`1.4028496`** (same as the first example, as the new molecule is less chlorinated than the second but similarly structured). 

However, this contradicts the trend. The correct prediction is likely higher than `1.4028496` but lower than `1.4545452`. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest prediction is:  
**`1.42`**. 

But to match the format, I'll provide a precise value:  
**`1.4345452`** (interpolated between the two closest examples). 

Final answer:  
**`1.4345452`**. 

---

After careful consideration, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**`1.4345452`**. 

This is slightly lower than the second example (`1.4545452`) due to fewer Cl atoms but higher than the first example (`1.4028496`) due to more aromatic chlorination. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` is:  
**`1.4345452`**.

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 1.1564503281046343
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and steric effects. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl groups and one central phenyl group).
2. **Phosphate ester linkage (OP(=O)(OAr)OAr)**: Highly polar and bulky.
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: Small hydrophobic groups.
4. **No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups**: The substituents are moderately neutral (methyl and aromatic rings).

### Observations from the training data:
- Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., phosphate, sulfoxide, nitro)** tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly positive (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` has `1.41452034`, but `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has `-0.48891855`).
- **Aromatic systems with no strong polar groups** (e.g., `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`) have values near zero (`-0.03968164`).
- **Bulky hydrophobic systems** (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`) have moderately negative values (`-0.34220433`).

### Prediction:
This molecule has a **bulky phosphate ester linking aromatic rings**, which introduces polarity but also steric hindrance. The lack of strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups and the presence of methyl substituents suggest a modest impact on the property. 

Given the training examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: `0.08532747`**  

This is based on similarities to molecules like `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (value `0.08532747`), which also combines aromaticity with polar/hindered substituents. The phosphate group's polarity is offset by the hydrophobic methyl groups, leading to a near-neutral value. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a quantum-chemical descriptor—this is an empirical estimate based on structural analogies.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -4.6325271485230655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the molecule (attached to the benzene ring). From the examples, CF3-containing groups (e.g., in "NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl") tend to contribute to more negative or less positive property values, but this depends on the rest of the structure.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The benzene ring has a CF3 group and is connected to a heterocyclic moiety (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O). Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (like NO2 in the examples) often reduce the property value (e.g., "Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O" has a value of 0.709, but simpler nitroaromatics like "Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" have -0.114).
3. **Heterocyclic moiety (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar, and likely rigid structure with two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Chlorine substituents can increase the property value when present in large numbers (e.g., "ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl" has 1.717), but here there are only two chlorines and other polar groups may offset this.
4. **Polarity and functional groups**: The molecule has high polarity due to CF3, C=O, and Cl groups, but the net effect depends on balance. Similar polar molecules in the examples span a wide range (e.g., "CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl" has 0.863, while "NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl" has -3.369).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog might be "Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O" (property = -1.847), which has an electron-withdrawing group (NO2) on an aromatic ring and a chlorine. Here, CF3 is similarly electron-withdrawing, and the heterocycle adds complexity but also polarity.
- Another similar molecule is "CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C" (property = 0.207), which has CF3 and polar groups but is less halogenated.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of CF3, aromaticity, and a highly polar/chlorinated heterocycle, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely so**, similar to other polar aromatic systems with halogens. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and 0.0**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.413**  
*(This aligns with molecules like "ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2" (-0.413), which have balanced halogenation and polarity.)*

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.11468718664020819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of **0.48908749**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and tends to increase the property value when attached to an aromatic ring.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Ether Groups (O-R)**:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a property value of **-3.1873338**, but this is likely due to the hydroxyl group (OH), which is more polar and hydrogen-bonding than an ether (O-R).
   - Ethers (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**) are less polar than hydroxyl groups, but their effect depends on the context.

3. **Combined Substituents**:
   - The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has both a methoxy group (**OCH3**) and a nitro group (**NO2**) on the benzene ring. 
   - The methoxy group is electron-donating (+M effect), while the nitro group is electron-withdrawing (-M and -I effects). The net effect is likely a balance, but the nitro group's strong withdrawing nature may dominate.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (a complex aromatic with ether and amide groups) has a value of **0.72933255**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (dimethyl phthalate) has a value of **0.30861018**.
   - These suggest that aromatic systems with moderately polar substituents tend to have property values in the range of **0.3 to 0.7**.

### Prediction:
Given that **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has:
- A nitro group (strongly electron-withdrawing, tends to increase the property value).
- A methoxy group (electron-donating, but less impactful than the nitro group).

The presence of the nitro group is the dominant factor, and the methoxy group slightly moderates its effect. Comparing to similar molecules:
- **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (0.48908749) has two nitro groups, so one nitro group would likely give a lower value.
- **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (0.30861018) has ester groups, which are less polar than nitro.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** would be slightly higher than 0.3 but less than 0.489. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.42** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

However, looking more closely at **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (0.729) and **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (0.489), a single nitro group with an ether might be closer to **0.4**. 

Given the examples, a refined estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45** (likely between 0.4 and 0.5). 

But to match the precision of the given data, let's round to **0.45**. 

However, since the exact trend isn't perfectly linear, another close example is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (0.68078561), which has multiple halogens and a nitro-like group. Given that, **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** might be slightly lower, say **0.40**.

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.42**. 

But to align with the given examples' precision, I'll finalize:  
**0.43**. 

Given the variability, the closest reasonable prediction is:  
**0.45**. 

However, reviewing again, **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is 0.489, and **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one fewer nitro group, so perhaps **0.40** is better. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.40**. 

But to be precise, given the data, the best match is likely:  
**0.42**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is:  
**0.42**.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.8063827308073919
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule contains **8 chlorine atoms**, which is a significant electronegative and bulky substituent. 
   - Example: **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane) has a high property value of **1.66185967** due to its high chlorine content.
   - Another example: **BrC(Br)Br** (bromotrichloromethane) has a value of **1.50962464**, showing that halogens increase the property value.

2. **Polycyclic Rigidity**: The molecule is a polycyclic (cage-like) structure with multiple fused rings, similar to steroidal or adamantane-like systems. 
   - Example: **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroidal ketone) has a value of **-1.30347995**, but this is less chlorinated.
   - Rigid, halogenated polycyclic systems tend to have higher values (e.g., **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**).

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: The high chlorine count will strongly withdraw electron density, likely increasing the property value (as seen in other halogenated examples).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**, which has **6 chlorines** and a value of **1.66185967**.
- The given molecule has **8 chlorines** and a more rigid polycyclic structure, which would further increase the property value.

### Predicted Value:
Given the extreme halogenation and rigidity, the property value should be **higher than 1.66185967**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.85**  

This accounts for the additional chlorine atoms and increased steric/electronic effects compared to the hexachlorocyclohexane example.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 0.31156365  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.51510358  
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (non-1-ene): -0.11057022  
   - **CCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): -2.07644261  
   - Simple hydrocarbons tend to have moderate values (near 0), while unsaturation (e.g., triple bonds) or aromaticity can lower the value.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...** (complex ether/alcohol): 1.53516806  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with aromatic amine): -0.25762624  
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenylethanol): -2.50083249  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C(C)C** (cyclic imide): 0.0138071  
   - Oxygenated groups (ethers, esters, alcohols) show varied effects, but esters (C=O) often have values near 0 or slightly negative.

3. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): 0.0  
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane): 1.66185967  
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to increase the property, especially with multiple substitutions.

4. **Nitro/Nitrogen-Containing Groups**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 0.48908749  
   - **NNc1ccccc1** (hydrazinobenzene): -2.52800548  
   - Nitro groups increase the value, while amines/hydrazines decrease it.

5. **Sulfur-Containing Groups**:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -2.66362712  
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSP(=S)(OCC)OCC**: 1.70881049  
   - Sulfur effects are mixed but often increase the property when highly substituted.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (Propyl Formate):
- **Structure**: Propyl group (**CCC**) attached to an ester (**OC=O**).  
- Similar examples:  
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.25762624 (ethyl ester with aromatic amine).  
  - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 1.14214132 (complex ester with ether/aromatic).  
  - **CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: 1.31667451 (cyclic ester/imide).  
- Simple esters (without additional functional groups) tend to have values near **-0.2 to 0.5**.  
- **Propyl formate** is a simpler ester (no aromaticity or additional polar groups), so we expect a value closer to the lower end of this range.

### Predicted Property for **CCCOC=O**:
Based on the trends, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.3** (slightly negative due to the ester group, but not as low as aromatic or highly polar examples).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.3** (approximate; exact value would require fitting a model, but this aligns with the given examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: The molecule has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons, including the carbonyl carbon). From the examples:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a property value of **-2.07644261**.
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde) has a value of **-0.25302082**.
   - Long chains tend to decrease the property value (more negative), but the presence of polar groups can offset this.

2. **Ester Functional Group (C(=O)OCC)**: The molecule is an ester (ethyl ester of decanoic acid). From the examples:
   - **COCC(=O)N(...)** (ester with aromatic) has a value of **0.36283843**.
   - **CCOC(=O)...** (other esters) have values around **0.25505586** to **0.42752774**.
   - Esters generally contribute positively to the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Polarity and Balance**:
   - The long hydrophobic chain would push the value down (more negative).
   - The polar ester group would push the value up (less negative or positive).
   - The net effect is likely a compromise between these two opposing trends.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **-2.07644261** (no polar group, very negative).
- **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): **-0.25302082** (polar C=O offsets hydrocarbon).
- **CCOC(=O)...** (esters): values around **0.2 to 0.4**.

Given that **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** has a much longer chain than hexylbenzene but also a polar ester group, the property value should be less negative than hexylbenzene but not as high as smaller esters. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -1.0**. Splitting the difference, I predict:  
**-0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (approximate; likely between -0.5 and -1.0 based on structural trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

True Property: 0.8343446733294813
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: This is similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -1.44838949), but here it's extended with additional functional groups.
2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 0.72933255) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = -0.78568687). Amides tend to increase the property value compared to simple phenols.
3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -1.84701994). Nitro groups are electron-withdrawing and may lower the property, but their effect depends on context.
4. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Present in many examples, generally increasing the property (e.g., **ClCC(Cl)Cl** = 1.15796831, **Cl\C=C/Cl** = 0.69108223).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (0.72933255): This has an amide and phenol/chloro-substituted rings, similar to our molecule but with a dimethylamide instead of a nitro group. The nitro group here is likely less stabilizing than the dimethylamide, so the property might be lower.
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-1.84701994): This has a nitro group and chloro-substitution, but lacks the amide and phenol, which would raise the property.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (0.69912245): This has an amide and aromatic rings, similar to our molecule but without nitro or chloro groups. The nitro and chloro groups here might balance out to a similar value.

### Prediction:
The molecule combines features that both increase (amide, chloro-substitution) and decrease (nitro group) the property. Given the similarities to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (0.72933255) but with a nitro group replacing the dimethylamide, the property is likely slightly lower but still positive. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 0.45** (specific value between 0.4 and 0.5, balancing the effects of the amide, chloro-substitution, and nitro group). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. The true property could vary depending on its definition.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.5970550611313821
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC))**: These are present twice in the molecule. From the examples, molecules with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CCSSCC**, **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**) tend to have higher property values (1.03104343 and -1.40578957, respectively). The presence of **P(=S)** may contribute positively.
2. **Aromatic Rings and Thioether Linkage (Sc1ccc...cc1)**: The molecule has two aromatic rings linked by a thioether (S). Aromatic systems with substitutions (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**) often have values around 0.4-0.5, but thioether linkages are less common in the examples.
3. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, similar to **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (value: 0.53874764), which also has multiple substitutions and symmetry.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: 0.16529198), which has a phosphorothioate group and aromatic system. However, our molecule has two phosphorothioate groups and a larger conjugated system, likely increasing the value.
- **CCSSCC** (value: 1.03104343) suggests sulfur-rich molecules can have higher values.
- The symmetry and multiple **P(=S)** groups may push the value higher than 0.5 but likely below 1.0 (since **CCSSCC** is simpler and has 1.03).

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is **0.67857651** (similar to **CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C**, which also has complex sulfur and aromatic features). However, considering the two **P(=S)** groups and symmetry, a slightly higher value is plausible.

**Final Prediction: 0.75**  
*(This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the examples, as no exact match exists.)*

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.11468718664020819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = 0.22267287
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.57505441
   - The nitro group appears to have a variable effect depending on other substituents. When paired with electron-donating groups (e.g., -O-), the property tends to be less negative or positive. When paired with alkyl/neutral groups, it is more negative.

2. **Presence of Hydroxy Group (-OH)**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = -0.25762624
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = 0.14969597
   - The hydroxy group alone does not drastically shift the property but may moderate the effect of other groups.

3. **Substitution Pattern**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a hydroxy group (-OH) and a nitro group (-NO2) on a benzene ring, similar to **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = 0.22267287), but without the chloro substituents. The absence of electron-withdrawing chloro groups may make the property slightly less positive.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = -0.57505441) has a nitro group and a methyl group, but no hydroxy group. The hydroxy group in **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is electron-donating, which may counteract the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, leading to a less negative property than -0.57505441.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely between the values for **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (0.22267287) and **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.57505441). A reasonable estimate is slightly positive due to the balancing effect of the hydroxy and nitro groups.

**Predicted property value: 0.14969597**  
*(This matches the value for **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, which also has a hydroxy group and electron-withdrawing substituents, suggesting a similar magnitude.)*

Iteration: 78
SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -1.1990818910513408
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a large, highly polar carbohydrate with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (-O-). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, sugars) tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `0.0`, and sugars with multiple -OH groups like `CC34CCC1C(CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CC(O)C4O` have negative values).
- The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is even more polar and complex than most examples, with a high density of -OH groups and a branched sugar structure.

Given this, the predicted property value would likely be close to zero or slightly negative, similar to other highly polar, multi-hydroxylated molecules in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.5**  

This aligns with the trend where large, polar, and hydrogen-bonding molecules (like polysaccharides) have moderately negative values, while nonpolar or halogenated molecules tend to have positive values.

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.5151035773849553
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptan-4-ol): **0.25505586**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (hexadecan-1-ol): **0.25505586**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (octadecan-1-ol): **0.25505586**
   - **CC(C)OC(C)C** (diisopropyl ether): **0.25505586**
   - These suggest that simple aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., -OH) or ether linkages tend to have a property value around **0.255**.

2. **Alkynes**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (1,4-dicyanobenzene): **0.25196813**
     - This is a conjugated alkyne (triple bond in an aromatic system), and its value is close to the aliphatic trend (~0.25).
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne) is a simpler alkyne without conjugation or aromaticity, so its value might be similar or slightly lower.

3. **Polar vs. Nonpolar Groups**:
   - Nonpolar alkanes (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**: **-2.07644261**) have much lower values.
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N) tend to increase the property value toward the ~0.25 range.

4. **Triple Bonds**:
   - The presence of a triple bond in **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** did not significantly deviate from the aliphatic trend, suggesting that triple bonds in non-aromatic systems (like **CCC#C**) may also align with this trend.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a linear alkyne with no additional functional groups. Its structure is simpler than the examples with polar groups but more polar than pure alkanes due to the triple bond.
- Given that alkynes are moderately polar (but less polar than alcohols or ethers), the property value is likely slightly lower than the **0.255** seen for alcohols/ethers but higher than nonpolar alkanes.
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.20**, similar to the first example (**CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2**: **0.20776842**), which has some polarity but no strong polar groups.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCC#C: 0.20** (approximate, likely in the range 0.18–0.22). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that alkynes with no additional functional groups tend to have values slightly below those of polar aliphatics but above nonpolar alkanes.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.8634554973248068
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a property value of **0.16529198**. The presence of P(=S) often correlates with moderately positive property values in the dataset.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions (c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: This is a heavily chlorinated benzene ring, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **0.53874764**) and **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = **0.43021803**). These suggest that chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive property values, especially with multiple Cl substitutions.
3. **Ethoxy groups (CCO and CC)**: These are relatively neutral contributors, as seen in molecules like **CCCCOCCCC** (property = **0.25505586**), but their effect is secondary compared to the P(=S) and Cl substitutions.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the dataset is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **0.16529198**), which shares the P(=S) group and a chlorinated aromatic ring. However, our target molecule has more Cl substitutions on the ring, which likely increases the property value (as seen in other Cl-heavy examples).
- Another relevant example is **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = **0.22267287**), which has a chlorinated aromatic ring with an ether linkage (similar to our molecule's **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**).

### Synthesis of Observations:
1. The P(=S) group suggests a baseline property value around **0.15–0.25**.
2. The tri-chlorinated aromatic ring pushes this higher, likely adding **~0.1–0.2** based on other Cl-heavy examples.
3. The ethoxy groups are neutral or slightly positive.

Thus, the predicted property value should be in the range of **0.25–0.35**, leaning toward the higher end due to the Cl substitutions.

### Final Prediction:
Given the similarities to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.165) and **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (0.222), but with more Cl substitutions, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the dataset). 

For higher precision, a value like **0.248** or **0.252** would also be plausible, but **0.25** is a defensible midpoint. 

(Note: Without a clear linear trend or exact matches, this is an approximate interpolation based on structural motifs.)

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.4686958010968307
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring (`c1nccc...c1`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide or hydrazone-like group).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic nitrogen (in the pyridine ring).
   - Carbonyl group (`C=O`) conjugated with a hydrazine (`NN`) group, which is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of the `C(=O)NN` group suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which often correlates with lower (more negative) property values in the given examples (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl` has -1.448, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has -5.588).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`) tend to have negative property values.
- The `C(=O)NN` group is more polar than a simple chloro or amino substituent, suggesting a stronger effect.
- The pyridine ring is less electron-rich than benzene, but the `C(=O)NN` group's electron-withdrawing nature may further lower the property value.

### Closest Analogues:
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property: -0.279): Less polar than our molecule.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (property: -5.588): Highly polar with multiple electronegative atoms.
- `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (property: -1.448): Moderate polarity.

Given the `C(=O)NN` group's strong polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential, the property value is likely more negative than `Nc1ccccc1Cl` but less extreme than `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **-2.0** (interpolating between the examples). 

### Final Answer:
**-2.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.760916349344534
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group. In the examples, molecules with **P(=S)** or similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have property values around **-2.66362712**. This suggests that the presence of **P(=S)** may contribute to a more negative property value.

2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether linkage may slightly increase the property value compared to pure phosphorothioates, as sulfur-containing groups like **CCS** have a value of **0.7214815**.

3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**) tend to have negative values around **-1.69031292**, but the effect here may be moderated by the cyclic structure.

4. **Cyclohexyl Ring (N1CCCCC1C)**: Cyclic aliphatic structures (e.g., **C/C1CCCCC1\C**) tend to have moderately positive values (~**0.31156365**), but this is offset by the electronegative groups attached.

5. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are neutral contributors unless paired with strongly polar groups.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the examples is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a value of **-2.66362712**. However, our molecule lacks the aromatic nitro groups and has additional alkyl/amide components, which would raise the value slightly.
- Another similar molecule is **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (value: **-1.40578957**), which shares the thioether and amide features but lacks the phosphorothioate.

### Synthesis of Features:
The phosphorothioate dominates, pulling the value toward **-2.6**, but the thioether and amide groups raise it slightly. The cyclohexyl ring and alkyl chains further moderate the negativity.

### Predicted Value:
Considering all these factors, the predicted property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is approximately:  
**-1.85**  

This balances the strong negativity of the **P(=S)** group with the opposing contributions from the other structural features.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.31156364970167044
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a straight-chain alkane. 

From the examples, we can see that similar alkanes and alkyl chains have property values around **0.25505586** (e.g., **CCC(O)CC**, **CCCCCCCO**, **CC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CCO**, **CC(C)(C)CO**, **CCCC(C)(C)CO**). 

Additionally, purely hydrocarbon chains without functional groups (e.g., **C/C1CCCCC1\C**, **CCCC1CCCC1**) have values around **0.31156365**, suggesting that longer or more saturated hydrocarbons may have slightly higher values than those with oxygen-containing functional groups.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a longer, fully saturated hydrocarbon without any functional groups, its property value is likely **close to or slightly higher than 0.31156365**. 

However, comparing it to **CCCC1CCCC1** (which has a cyclic structure and a value of **0.31156365**), a linear alkane like octane might have a similar or slightly lower value. 

Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCC** is:  

**Predicted property value: 0.31156365**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural similarity to the given examples.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -1.7046140959402005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure resembling steroids (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, which has a property value of **-1.15458701**).
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: Present in the ring system (similar to many examples with negative property values).
3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: Attached to the ring (also common in negative property examples).
4. **Alkyne (C#C)**: A terminal alkyne group, which is less common in the examples but may slightly increase hydrophobicity or reduce polarity.
5. **Ring strain and rigidity**: The fused ring system suggests low flexibility, often associated with negative property values.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**: Property = **-1.15458701**  
  (Similar steroid backbone with ketone and hydroxyl, but no alkyne)
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: Property = **-3.71495834**  
  (More complex steroid with multiple ketones, very negative value)
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = **-0.60309328**  
  (Steroid with ketone, hydroxyl, and additional polar groups)

### Adjustments for Alkyne:
The terminal alkyne (**C#C**) is a minor hydrophobic contributor but less polar than hydroxyl/ketone. This might slightly raise the property value compared to pure steroid examples.

### Prediction:
Given the steroid-like core with **one ketone and two hydroxyl groups**, the property value should be close to **-1.15458701** (from the most similar example). The alkyne may offset this slightly, leading to a less negative value.  

**Final Predicted Property Value: -0.9**  
*(Likely between -1.15 and -0.6 based on the examples.)*  

---  
*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on structural trends in the data.*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 1.5351680635010059
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, predicting the exact property value requires careful analysis of structural features and their correlation with the given property values. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -2.076).
   - Polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54`) have positive values (~1.076), likely due to extended conjugation.

2. **Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro, carbonyl) can increase or decrease the property depending on context. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a positive value (0.489).
     - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a negative value (-0.115).
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., hydroxyl, ether) often reduce the property (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -1.448).

3. **Complexity and Hybridization**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups and hybridized systems (e.g., sugars, fused rings) show intermediate values. For example:
     - `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` has -0.366.
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` has -0.597.

4. **Size and Flexibility**:
   - Larger, flexible molecules with many rotatable bonds (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O`) tend to have small positive or near-zero values (0.255).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
- **Structural Features**:
  1. **Aromatic Rings**: Two benzene rings (`c1cc...` and `c7cc...`) with methoxy and hydroxyl substituents. These are likely to reduce the property (similar to `Oc1ccccc1Cl`).
  2. **Polycyclic System**: A fused ring system (`C6C2C...c7cc67`) resembling polycyclic aromatics but with heteroatoms and saturation. This could contribute positively (~1.0).
  3. **Oxygen-Rich Groups**: Multiple ethers (`OC`), hydroxyls (`O`), and a carbonyl (`C=O`). These will reduce the property (as seen in other oxygenated examples).
  4. **Sugar-like Moieties**: The `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O` fragment resembles a carbohydrate, which typically has small or negative values (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2...` has -0.366).

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The polycyclic core might contribute ~1.0.
- The oxygen-rich substituents and sugar-like parts could reduce this by ~1.5 (similar to other oxygenated examples).
- The net effect is likely a small positive or near-zero value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the polycyclic core (positive contribution) and oxygen substituents (negative contribution), the predicted value is approximately **0.25**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.2 based on the variability in the examples). 

This aligns with similar-sized, oxygen-rich polycyclic molecules in the dataset (e.g., `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has 1.36, but with fewer aromatic rings; `C1C(O)CCC2...` has -0.37). The exact value would depend on finer electronic effects, but 0.25 is a reasonable estimate.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituents and Their Effects**:
   - **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, halogens like Cl, Br, I)** tend to increase the property value (more positive).
   - **Electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, OCH₃, alkyl groups)** tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - Multiple halogens or bulky substituents (e.g., polyhalogenated aromatics) often lead to higher positive values.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene rings with neutral substituents (e.g., alkyl groups) have values around -2.9 to -0.8.
   - Polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene, biphenyl) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 0.28 to 1.07).

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene)**: -2.94903331 (strongly negative due to fluorine's inductive effect).
   - **Clc1ccccc1I (chloroiodobenzene)**: 0.60627799 (halogens increase the value).
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol)**: -0.11468719 (OH and NO₂ compete in effects).
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol)**: -0.11468719 (same as above).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (hexachlorobiphenyl)**: 0.83629949 (many Cl atoms increase value).

4. **OH and Cl on Benzene**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **4-chlorophenol** (OH and Cl substituents on benzene).
   - OH is electron-donating (lowers value), while Cl is weakly electron-withdrawing (increases value).
   - The net effect is likely a balance between these two competing substituents.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -0.11468719 (OH and NO₂; NO₂ is stronger than Cl).
- **Clc1ccccc1I**: 0.60627799 (Cl and I; both halogens but I is heavier).
- **Fc1ccccc1**: -2.94903331 (F is strongly electron-withdrawing but small).

Given that Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but more than H, and OH is electron-donating, the value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** should be between the nitrophenol (-0.114) and chlorobenzene (no OH, likely higher). 

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is slightly negative but closer to zero due to the competing effects. A good match is **-0.11468719** (same as nitrophenol, as the OH/Cl balance is similar in magnitude to OH/NO₂ balance). However, since Cl is less withdrawing than NO₂, the value might be slightly more negative. 

But looking at **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** and **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, both have the same value (-0.11468719), suggesting the position of substituents doesn't change the property much. Thus, for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, we can predict a similar value.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.11468719** (same as the nitrophenol examples, as the OH/Cl interplay is analogous to OH/NO₂ in magnitude). 

However, if we consider that Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂, the value might be slightly lower (more negative). But given the data, the closest match is **-0.11468719**. 

For precision, let's average the nitrophenol value (-0.11468719) and chlorobenzene (no direct example, but Clc1ccccc1I is 0.60627799; removing I's effect, Cl alone might be ~0.3). The average is ~0.1, but OH dominates, so likely closer to nitrophenol.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:
**-0.11468719**

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.6030932838881273
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Similar to molecules like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 0.836) and `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property = -2.664). The presence of Cl on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatics (e.g., `c1ccccc1` = -2.076).
   - **Amide group (OC(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (property = -0.786) and `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property = -4.633). Amides generally lower the property value.
   - **Alkyne (C#C) and ether (O)**: The alkyne is relatively rare in the examples, but ethers (e.g., `COc1ncnc2nccnc12` = 0.223) and oxygenated chains tend to have neutral to slightly positive contributions.
   - **Chlorinated aliphatic chain (ClCC)**: Similar to `CCCCl` (property = 0.660) but with an additional Cl, which may increase the value slightly.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog is likely `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property = -4.633), which has a highly electronegative trifluoromethyl group and multiple Cl atoms, but our molecule lacks the CF3 group and has fewer Cl atoms. Thus, the property should be less negative.
   - Another similar molecule is `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (property = -0.258), which has an amide and ether but no Cl or alkyne. Our molecule's additional Cl and alkyne may push the value slightly higher.

3. **Overall Trend**:
   - The aromatic Cl substituents and aliphatic Cl will increase the property compared to pure hydrocarbons or simple amides.
   - The amide and alkyne may moderate this increase slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of these features, the property is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: 0.75**  

This aligns with the trend where Cl substitution increases the value, while the amide and alkyne moderate it slightly compared to highly halogenated examples (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` = 1.662).

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.44008019997780506
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring with nitrogens, `c2cncnc2`).
2. **Substituents**:
   - A hydroxyl group (`OH`) attached to a central carbon.
   - Two chlorine atoms (`Cl`), one on each benzene ring.
   - A heterocyclic ring (`c2cncnc2`) with nitrogen atoms, which is polar and may contribute to hydrogen bonding or dipole moments.
3. **Steric and electronic effects**: The central carbon is bonded to three bulky aromatic systems, which may influence the property.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Polar/charged groups**: Molecules with polar/charged groups (e.g., `N`, `O`, `Cl`) often have negative property values (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1` = -2.095, `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` = -1.303). However, bulky aromatic systems can offset this.
- **Chlorinated aromatics**: 
  - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` = 0.0 (symmetrical, no net effect).
  - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 0.297 (asymmetrical substitution increases the value).
- **Bulky aromatic systems**: 
  - `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenylamine) = 0.192.
  - `O=C1N(COC(=O)C)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` = 1.436 (bulky, highly substituted).

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- Two chlorine atoms (contributing ~0.3 each, asymmetrically placed).
- A polar heterocycle (`c2cncnc2`, similar to pyridine, which may slightly decrease the value).
- A hydroxyl group (typically decreases the value, but here it's sterically hindered by bulky groups).
- Three aromatic rings (bulkiness increases the value).

Balancing these effects:
- The asymmetrical chlorination and bulky aromatic systems suggest a positive value.
- The polar groups (OH, `cncn`) may slightly reduce it.

**Predicted property value: ~0.45**

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (estimated based on structural analogs in the dataset).
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbonyl-containing compounds (C=O)**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (ethyl acetoacetate): 0.9056
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): -0.7787
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): -0.7787
   - **CC(=O)OC3(CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C)C(C)=O**: 0.1145
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**: 0.0982
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (formylfuran): -2.1910

   Esters (R-COO-R') tend to have values around **-0.7 to -0.8** (e.g., ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate), while formates (R-O-CH=O) might differ slightly due to the aldehyde-like character of the formyl group.

2. **Chain length and branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCBr**: 0.8454) tend to increase the property value slightly compared to shorter chains.
   - Branching or cyclic structures can either increase or decrease the value depending on other functional groups.

3. **Functional group contributions**:
   - **-NO2 groups** (e.g., **N(=O)=O**) significantly increase the value (e.g., +1.1130 for a nitroaromatic).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)** increase the value (e.g., **CCI**: 1.0544, **BrC(Br)Br**: 1.5096).
   - **Aromatic rings** with no polar groups tend to decrease the value (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1C**: -0.8188).

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate):
- It is an ester (**R-O-CH=O**) with a butyl chain (**CCCC**) and a formyl group (**OC=O**).
- Compared to **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate: -0.7787), the longer butyl chain might slightly increase the value (less negative), but the formyl group (unlike acetyl) could have a different effect.
- The closest analog is **O=Cc1ccco1** (formylfuran: -2.1910), but this is an aromatic aldehyde, not directly comparable.
- Another close analog is **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (ethyl acetoacetate: 0.9056), but this has two carbonyls and is not a formate.

Given that most simple esters (e.g., ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate) are around **-0.7 to -0.8**, and formates might be slightly more negative due to the aldehyde-like character, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCOC=O** is:

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  
*(This is slightly more negative than ethyl acetate due to the formyl group but less extreme than aromatic aldehydes.)*  

However, looking back at **CCCC=O** (butyraldehyde: -0.2530) and **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal: -0.2530), aldehydes seem less negative than esters. Since **CCCCOC=O** is a formate ester, it may still align more closely with other esters like **CC(=O)OCC** (-0.7787).  

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.78** (similar to ethyl acetate).  

But considering the butyl chain might slightly offset the formyl effect, the final prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

*(Given the uncertainty, this is an approximate estimate based on the trends.)*  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: -0.75**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.9331602828441236
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):

1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.93316028**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **1.00726931**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-1.44838949**.
   - The presence of chlorines tends to increase the property value when the molecule is small and aliphatic (e.g., ClCCCl), but aromatic chlorination can vary (e.g., dichlorobenzene is negative, hexachlorobenzene is positive).

2. **Size and Saturation**:
   - Small, saturated chlorinated molecules like **ClCCCl** have high positive values (~0.93).
   - **ClCCl** is even smaller and simpler than **ClCCCl**, but still saturated and chlorinated.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl**: 0.93316028 (two chlorines on a 2-carbon chain).
   - **ClCCl** is analogous but with one fewer carbon. The property value is likely similar or slightly lower due to reduced size.

4. **No Strong Electron-Withdrawing or Donating Groups**:
   - The property is not heavily influenced by additional functional groups (e.g., NO2, OH, etc.), so the value is primarily driven by the chlorines and simplicity.

### Predicted Property for ClCCl:
Given the above, **ClCCl** is expected to have a property value slightly lower than **ClCCCl** but still positive and relatively high. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (similar to ClCCCl but adjusted slightly downward for smaller size). 

This aligns with the trend that small, chlorinated aliphatic molecules have high positive values in this dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -3.1873338018286446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol-like structures (aromatic ring with -OH group)**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol): Property = 0.19268737
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = -1.30347995
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol): Property = -3.1873338
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** (diphenylmethanol-like): Property = -0.00377388

2. **Methyl-substituted aromatics**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not directly given, but similar to **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene): Property = -0.19000882
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** (xylene-like): Not directly given, but **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): Property = 0.28060423

3. **Combined features (methyl + hydroxyl on aromatic ring)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2-methylphenol or cresol-like structure).
   - The closest analog in the examples is **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a more heavily methyl-substituted phenol), which has a property = -3.1873338. However, this has two methyl groups, while our molecule has one methyl and one hydroxyl.

4. **Trends**:
   - Adding -OH to an aromatic ring tends to give a property ~0.19 (phenol) or lower if more polar groups are present (e.g., catechol = -1.30).
   - Methyl groups slightly increase the property compared to unsubstituted aromatics (e.g., toluene vs. benzene).
   - The presence of both -OH and -CH3 likely balances between these effects.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol (no methyl): 0.19268737
- Heavily methylated phenol: -3.1873338
- A single methyl + hydroxyl (like in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**) would likely be intermediate but closer to phenol due to the dominant -OH effect.

A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than phenol due to the methyl group's minor hydrophobic contribution. 

**Predicted property for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: ~ -0.15**

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical guess based on the given examples. The true value may depend on the specific property, such as logP, solubility, or another descriptor.) 

### Refined Guess:
Looking at **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) = -1.303 and **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) = 0.192, a mono-methyl phenol might be ~0.0 to -0.5. 

Given **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** = -0.00377388 (a bulkier diphenylmethanol), a simpler methylphenol might be similar. 

**Final predicted value: -0.10** (close to neutral, slightly negative due to -OH). 

However, the examples suggest that even small changes in structure can lead to significant property shifts, so this is an approximate estimate. 

For higher precision, more examples of methylphenols would be needed. 

---
**Final Answer:** The predicted property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is approximately **-0.10**. 

(Note: If the property is logP, this would align with a slight decrease due to -OH, but the exact value depends on the training data.) 

---
**Correction after re-evaluating examples**: 
The closest structural match is **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** = -3.187 (highly negative), but this has two methyl groups. For a single methylphenol, the value is likely less extreme. 

Given **Oc1ccccc1** = 0.192 and **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** = -0.003, a single methylphenol might be ~0.1. 

**Revised prediction: 0.10** (methyl slightly increases over phenol's 0.19). 

Given the variability, the safest guess is **0.0** (neutral). 

---
**Final refined prediction: 0.0** (interpolating between examples). 

(Exact value would require the property's definition or more data.) 

---
**User note**: The prediction is approximate due to limited examples. For a precise value, the property type (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.) and more training data would be needed. 

---
**Final answer**: Predicted property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** = **0.0**. 

(But given the examples, it could reasonably range between -0.5 to +0.2.) 

---
**After further thought**: The examples show that **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) = 0.192, and **Oc1ccccc1** = 0.192, so -OH on aromatic is ~0.19. Methyl substitution may not change this much. 

Thus, **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** ≈ **0.19** (same as phenol). 

---
**Final decision**: Given the uncertainty, the most consistent guess based on phenol-like examples is **0.19**. 

**Predicted value: 0.19** (same as phenol, as methyl may not significantly alter the property). 

---
**Conclusion**: The predicted property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is **0.19**, matching phenol's value due to the dominant -OH effect.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.4134485363350894
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular features such as halogenation (Cl, Br), aromaticity, and structural complexity. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure (similar to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs). From the examples, we observe that:  
1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **0.53874764**.  
2. **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (heptachlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **0.53874764** (same as above, likely due to similar substitution pattern).  
3. **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** (pentabrominated benzene) has a higher value of **1.33667439**, suggesting heavier halogens (Br) increase the property.  

The given molecule is a **hexachlorinated biphenyl** with a symmetrical substitution pattern, very similar to the first two examples above. Thus, the predicted property value should align closely with those cases.  

### Predicted Property Value: **0.53874764**  

This matches the trend where highly chlorinated aromatic systems with balanced substitution yield values in this range (~0.5–0.54). No additional functional groups or asymmetries are present to deviate significantly from the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.11057022071113204
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = 0.31156365
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = 0.31156365
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = -0.11057022
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene) is a branched alkene, similar to nonene but with more branching.

2. **Effect of Double Bonds**:
   - Double bonds tend to reduce the property value slightly compared to saturated chains (e.g., nonene vs. octane).
   - Branching may further reduce the value, as seen in **CC(C)=CC3C...** (property = 1.03720347, but this is a complex case with other functional groups).

3. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate): Property = -2.17002101 (but this has an ester group, which heavily influences the value).
   - **CC=C(C)C** is simpler, so the effect of the double bond and branching should be milder.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = -0.25302082
   - **CC=C(C)C** lacks the aldehyde group, so its value should be less negative but still lower than saturated hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Saturated hydrocarbons like octane have values around **0.311**.
- A linear alkene (nonene) reduces this to **-0.110**.
- Branching and a double bond (as in isoprene) would likely reduce the value further but not as drastically as polar functional groups.

A reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** is slightly more negative than nonene but less negative than aldehydes or esters. 

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (approximate, likely between -0.2 and -0.3).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CCCCCC(CC)C=O** (-0.253) and **CCCCCCCCC=C** (-0.110), isoprene's value should be between these. Since isoprene has more branching than nonene but no polar group, a value closer to **-0.15** might be more accurate. However, branching could push it slightly lower.

**Final predicted value: -0.18** (interpolated based on trends). 

Given the examples, the closest match is likely around **-0.15 to -0.25**. For specificity, I'll predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.20** (a balanced estimate considering branching and unsaturation). 

However, reviewing the examples again, **CC(C)=CC...** (complex molecule) has a positive value, but simpler alkenes like **CCCCCCCCC=C** are at -0.110. Thus, **CC=C(C)C** might be slightly more negative due to branching.

**Adjusted prediction: -0.15**. 

Given uncertainty, I'll settle on **-0.15** as the most plausible value. 

### Exact Match:
Looking for the closest simple hydrocarbon:
- **CCCCCCCCC=C**: -0.11057022
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.31156365
- **CC=C(C)C** is between these, likely closer to the alkene.

Thus, **-0.15** is reasonable. 

**Final answer: -0.15**. 

(Note: Without a clear exact match in the examples, this is an interpolated estimate.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, **CCCCCC(CC)C=O** is -0.253, and **CC=C(C)C** lacks the aldehyde, so perhaps closer to -0.1. 

Given the variability, I'll average the closest analogs:
- Nonene: -0.110
- Branched alkane: +0.311
- Isoprene is between, likely slightly negative.

**Final prediction: -0.10**. 

But branching may reduce further, so **-0.15** is safer. 

Given the data, the most consistent estimate is: 

**Predicted property value: -0.15**. 

(If forced to pick a single value from the examples' trends, **-0.15** is the best fit.) 

However, **CCCCCCCCC=C** is -0.110, and **CC=C(C)C** has more branching, so perhaps **-0.18**. 

To align with the given examples, I'll round to **-0.20**. 

**Final answer: -0.20**. 

(After careful consideration, this aligns best with the trend of branching and unsaturation reducing the value slightly below linear alkenes.) 

---

**Final predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: -0.20**.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.9331602828441236
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the dataset:

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Chlorine substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)`, `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`) tend to have **positive property values**, often > 1.0. 
   - Simpler chlorinated alkanes like `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` have very high values (~1.8).
   - However, aromatic chlorinated compounds like `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` have negative values (~-0.41).

2. **Small chlorinated molecules**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **1.179**.
   - `ClCCl` is simpler (only two chlorines) and lacks aromaticity or complex branching, so its value should be lower than highly chlorinated compounds but still likely positive.

3. **Non-chlorinated alkanes/alcohols**:
   - Simple alkanes/alcohols (e.g., `CC(C)C`, `CCO`) have values around **0.25–0.31**.
   - Chlorine substitution increases the property value compared to these.

### Prediction for `ClCCl`:
- It is a small, non-aromatic chlorinated molecule with only two chlorines. 
- Its value should be **positive but lower than highly chlorinated compounds** like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (1.179) or `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (1.806).
- A reasonable estimate is **between 0.5 and 1.0**, closer to the lower end due to its simplicity.

### Final predicted value:
**0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures in the dataset). 

This aligns with the trend where small chlorinated molecules have positive values, but not as extreme as heavily chlorinated or aromatic systems.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.1496959666318993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Phenols**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a property value of **0.14969597** in the provided examples.
   - The new molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is also a trichlorophenol (likely 2,3,5-trichlorophenol, with a slightly different substitution pattern).

2. **Effect of Chlorine Substitution**:
   - Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value when attached to aromatic rings, as seen in other examples like **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (0.99924488) and **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.14969597).
   - The position of chlorine substituents matters, but the overall trend is that more chlorines lead to higher values.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The new molecule has the same number of chlorines (3) and the same core structure (phenol) as **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, but the chlorines are arranged differently (2,3,5 vs. 2,4,6).
   - The property value is likely to be similar but not identical due to the slightly different electronic effects of the substitution pattern.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.14969597), the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should be in a comparable range. The meta-substitution (2,3,5) might slightly reduce the value compared to the symmetrical 2,4,6-substitution due to less additive electronic effects. 

**Predicted property value: 0.12** (slightly lower than 0.14969597 due to the less symmetrical substitution). 

However, since the examples show that even small changes can lead to noticeable differences, and the exact value is hard to pinpoint without a model, I would estimate it to be close to the given trichlorophenol example. 

**Final answer: 0.14** (rounded to match the precision of the given examples). 

But reviewing the examples again, the value for **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is 0.14969597, and the new molecule is very similar, so the most reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.14969597** (same as the given trichlorophenol, as the difference in substitution pattern may not significantly alter the property in this context). 

However, if we must distinguish, a slight adjustment to **0.13** might be more accurate. 

Given the data, the safest answer is: **0.14969597** (same as the provided trichlorophenol example). 

But since the question asks for a specific value, and the examples show that small changes in structure can lead to small changes in the property, I will predict:

**0.14** (approximating the given example). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is: 

**0.14** (rounded from the given example's 0.14969597). 

However, looking back at the examples, the value for **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is 0.14969597, and the new molecule is almost identical in terms of substituent count and type, so the most precise answer is to reuse the given value: 

**Predicted property value: 0.14969597**. 

But if the answer must be distinct, I would estimate a slight decrease due to the less symmetrical substitution, so: 

**0.13**. 

Given the ambiguity, the best answer is: 

**0.14969597** (same as the provided example of a trichlorophenol). 

Final answer: **0.14969597**. 

---

After careful consideration, the most accurate prediction based on the given examples is: 

**Predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl: 0.14969597** (same as the provided trichlorophenol example, as the structural difference is minimal).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 1.5351680635010059
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Molecule to Predict:
**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: 
   - Examples with similar features:
     - `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` → -3.1873338 (highly negative)
     - `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → -0.11468719
     - Aromatic rings with polar substituents tend to lower the property value.

2. **Ketone (C=O) group**:
   - Examples:
     - `CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C` → 0.67857651
     - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` → 1.43632711
     - Ketones can contribute positively or negatively depending on context.

3. **Ether linkages (C-O-C) and cyclic ethers**:
   - Examples:
     - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` → -0.51510358
     - `CCOC2Oc1ccc(OS(C)(=O)=O)cc1C2(C)C` → -0.92381221
     - Ethers and polyethers tend to lower the property value.

4. **Fused polycyclic system**:
   - Examples:
     - `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` → 1.17761665
     - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` → 1.25892817
     - Fused aromatic systems tend to increase the property value.

5. **Sugar-like (carbohydrate) moieties**:
   - Examples:
     - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` → -0.51510358
     - Sugar-like structures tend to lower the property value.

### Dominant Features:
- The molecule has a mix of aromatic rings with polar substituents (lowering effect), fused polycyclic systems (raising effect), and sugar-like moieties (lowering effect). 
- The presence of multiple ethers and hydroxyl groups suggests a significant lowering effect, similar to the sugar-like examples.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to complex polycyclic structures with polar groups, such as:
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (-0.51510358)
  - `CCOC2Oc1ccc(OS(C)(=O)=O)cc1C2(C)C` (-0.92381221)
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (-3.71495834)

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the fused polycyclic system (raising) and the polar/sugar-like moieties (lowering), the property value is likely moderately negative, similar to the sugar-like examples but slightly higher due to the fused rings.

**Predicted Property Value: -1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -2.2936736935363187
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS) group**, a **carbonyl (=O)**, and an **amino (NH) group**. The ring is also substituted with a bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** group.
   - Similar to: **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: -0.75337696) and **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: -1.16395669), which also have heterocyclic rings with carbonyl and amino groups, along with bulky substituents.

2. **Polar Groups**: The presence of **S**, **C=O**, and **NH** introduces polarity, but the **tert-butyl group** adds hydrophobicity.
   - Similar to: **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: 0.1806992), which has sulfur and carbonyl groups but lacks bulky substituents.

3. **Bulky Substituent**: The **tert-butyl group** is sterically demanding, which may reduce solubility or increase hydrophobicity, similar to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: -1.16395669).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analog is **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: -1.16395669), which shares:
  - A heterocyclic ring with **S** and **C=O**.
  - A **tert-butyl group**.
  - The property value is negative, likely due to reduced polarity from the bulky group.

- Another similar molecule is **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: -0.75337696), which lacks sulfur but has a carbonyl and amino group.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C**, but with a slightly less polarizable sulfur (compared to the oxygen in the reference), the property value should be **slightly less negative** than -1.16395669 but still in the same range. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.95** (interpolating between -0.75337696 and -1.16395669).

### Final Answer:
**-0.95** (predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7856868747645065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = 0.19268737 (diphenyl ether)
   - **c1ccc2cnccc2c1**: Property = -0.60309328 (indole-like structure)
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**: Property = -2.66362712 (chlorinated polyaromatic)
   - Aromatic rings with neutral or moderately polar substituents tend to have properties in the range of -0.6 to 0.2.

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC**: Property = -0.77871969 (ethyl butanoate)
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OC**: Property = -0.77871969 (methyl hexanoate)
   - Esters with aliphatic chains tend to have properties around **-0.77 to -0.78**.

3. **Aromatic Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is ethyl benzoate, which combines an aromatic ring (like in **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) with an ester group (like in **CCCC(=O)OCC**).
   - The aromatic ring may slightly increase the property compared to purely aliphatic esters.

4. **Other Relevant Examples**:
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**: Property = -0.57505441 (aromatic amide, similar polarity to ester)
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.57505441 (nitro-substituted aromatic)

### Prediction:
- The ester group (**COO**) in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** suggests a property close to **-0.77 to -0.78** (like aliphatic esters).
- However, the aromatic ring may slightly raise this value (less negative) due to conjugation and reduced hydrophobicity compared to aliphatic chains.
- A reasonable estimate is between **-0.6 and -0.7**, closer to the aromatic amide/nitro examples.

### Final Prediction:
The property for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate)** is likely **-0.65**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polarity," the value aligns with expectations for an aromatic ester.)

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.8454160250886064
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., C-Br, C-Cl):**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated aromatic): Property = **-2.50083249**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (chlorinated biphenyl): Property = **-1.44838949**
   - **CI** (iodomethane): Property = **1.05438158**
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: Property = **0.76091635**

   The property values for alkyl halides vary widely, but simple linear alkyl halides (like **CCCCCCCBr**) are not directly represented in the examples. However, we can compare them to similar non-halogenated alkanes or other functional groups.

2. **Linear Alkanes/Alkyl Chains:**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (2-heptanone): Property = **-0.25302082**
   - **CCCCC (=O)CCCC** (2-nonanone): Property = **-0.25302082**
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): Property = **0.25505586**
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene): Property = **-0.11057022**

   Linear alkyl chains with polar functional groups (e.g., C=O, OH) have property values around **-0.25 to 0.25**, while non-polar chains (e.g., C=C) are slightly negative.

3. **Bromine Substitution:**
   - Bromine is electronegative and polarizable, which may increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but not as much as highly polar groups (e.g., NO2, SO3H).
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a high value (**1.05438158**), but this is a very small molecule with iodine, which is more polarizable than bromine.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). It has a moderate polarizability due to the Br atom but lacks strong polar functional groups (like C=O or OH).
- Compared to **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol, property = **0.25505586**), the Br substituent is less polar than OH but more polarizable than a pure alkane.
- Compared to **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene, property = **-0.11057022**), the Br substituent should increase the property value slightly.

Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely **between 0.0 and 0.3**, closer to the value for **CCCCCCCO** but slightly lower due to Br being less polar than OH.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 0.15** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual value could vary if the property depends on other factors not evident from the examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol)**:

1. **Simple alcohols and small polar molecules** tend to have property values in the range of **0.2 to 0.3** (e.g., `CCC(C)CO` and `CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` have values around **0.255**).  
2. **Methanol (CO)** is even simpler than most alcohols in the dataset (e.g., `CCC(C)CO`), so its value may be slightly lower due to fewer contributing functional groups.  
3. The presence of the **hydroxyl group (-OH)** suggests a moderate positive contribution, but the lack of additional complexity (e.g., rings, long chains, or nitro groups) limits the magnitude.  

### Predicted Property Value for **CO**:  
**~0.20**  

*(This is an estimate based on the trend of small polar molecules in the dataset. For higher precision, a more rigorous quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis would be needed, but this aligns with the given examples.)*  

---
**Note**: If you can provide more context about the property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), the prediction could be refined further. The current answer is based purely on structural analogies from the given data.
