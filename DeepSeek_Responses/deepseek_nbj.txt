SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.43391592155474723
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain with Ester Group**:  
   The molecule has a long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**CC(=O)OC**). This is structurally similar to:  
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (given in the examples with a property value of **0.44046128**).  
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (property value = **0.53179669**).  
   - **CCCCCC(=O)C** (property value = **0.20158243**).  

   These molecules all share the presence of an ester or carbonyl group with hydrocarbon chains, and their property values are in the range of **0.2 to 0.53**.

2. **Effect of Chain Length**:  
   Longer hydrocarbon chains tend to slightly decrease the property value (e.g., **CCCCCC(=O)C** has a lower value than **CCOC(=O)CC**). However, the ester group (**OC(=O)**) seems to contribute positively compared to simple ketones or aldehydes.

3. **Specific Comparison**:  
   The molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is almost identical to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** in the examples (property = **0.44046128**), except for minor differences in chain length or branching. Since the given molecule is the same as one in the examples, its property value should match exactly.

### Predicted Property Value:
The property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is **0.44046128**.  

### Final Answer:
**0.44046128**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.37659285250445473
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactam/lactone ring with a carbonyl group and NH). This is somewhat similar to the following examples:
   - **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.32145195): A 5-membered ring with carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: 0.12072116): A cyclic imide with multiple carbonyl groups.
   - **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (property: 1.88010739): A substituted uracil-like structure with carbonyl groups and Cl.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine atom** is attached to the benzene ring. From the examples, Cl tends to lower the property value (e.g., **ClC=C** has -1.01754766, **ClCC** has -2.07155559), but this depends on context.
   - The **lactam/lactone (oc(=O)[nH])** group is polar and may increase the property value (similar to carbonyl-containing molecules like **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** with 0.61437414).

3. **Aromaticity**: The benzene ring is present, and aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** with 0.85320088) tend to have moderately positive values.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is likely **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.32145195), but our molecule has an aromatic ring and a Cl substituent, which may increase the value slightly.
- The presence of both Cl (electron-withdrawing) and the polar lactam/lactone group suggests a balance between lowering and raising effects.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural features, the property value is likely **between 0 and 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (with an uncertainty of Â±0.2 based on the variability in similar examples). 

This balances the electron-withdrawing Cl (tending to lower the value) and the polar carbonyl/NH group (tending to raise it).

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0164964122398745
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule contains a nitro group, which is also present in **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** with a property value of **0.58933135**.
   - Nitro groups are generally electron-withdrawing and polar, which may contribute to higher property values (often positive in the given examples).

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - The molecule has an isopropyl group (**CC(C)**) attached to the nitro group. Alkyl groups are electron-donating and may slightly offset the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.
   - Compare with **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**, where the nitro group is attached to a heterocycle with additional alkyl and ether substituents. The property value here is **0.58933135**.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property: **1.16572323**) has a nitro-like fragment (amide + fluorine), but the nitro group is more polar, so we expect a slightly lower value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (property: **0.84178131**) is highly halogenated, suggesting that nitro groups may have comparable or slightly higher effects than halogens.

4. **Trend for Nitroalkanes**:
   - Nitroalkanes (e.g., **CC(C)N(=O)=O**) are less polar than nitroaromatics but still have significant polarity. The isopropyl group reduces the polarity slightly compared to a primary nitroalkane.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**. A reasonable estimate, considering the balance between the nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature and the alkyl group's electron-donating effect, is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65** (approximate, based on similar examples). 

For higher precision, interpolating between **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO (0.589)** and **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (1.166)**, and accounting for the alkyl group, a refined estimate is:

**Final predicted property value: 0.62**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that the property correlates with polarity/electron-withdrawing effects.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -1.9439763482616192
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. The property tends to be more negative for larger, more complex, and highly conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or steroidal structures), while simpler or halogenated molecules tend to have positive or less negative values.

The molecule in question is:  
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

This is a **steroid-like structure** with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups (`-OH`), and a carbonyl group (`C=O`). Comparing it to similar examples:  
- The molecule `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (a steroid backbone with ketones) has a property value of **-2.00196643**.  
- Other polycyclic or conjugated systems (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) also have highly negative values (e.g., **-1.1447625**).  

This molecule is even more polar due to the additional `-OH` and `-C(=O)CO` groups, which may slightly increase the property value compared to the pure hydrocarbon or simpler ketone examples. However, the dominant factor is the **polycyclic complexity**, which strongly drives the value downward.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-1.85**  

This estimate balances the highly negative trend of steroids/polycyclics with the slight mitigating effect of the polar substituents.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -1.2681601159635427
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - From the examples, aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) tend to have positive property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: 0.588, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: 0.462).
   - The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) suggests a moderate positive contribution.

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (C(=O)NC(=O)N). 
   - Amides (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1: 0.491) tend to have positive but not extremely high values.
   - The urea-like linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N) may slightly increase the value due to polarity/hydrogen bonding.

3. **Polar Substituents**: The fluorine and chlorine atoms add electronegativity and polarity, which generally increase the property value (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: 0.588, Fc1ccccc1: ~0.4-0.5 range).

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: 0.588 (dichlorobenzene)
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1: 0.491 (amide + aromatic)
   - The given molecule combines features of both, with additional fluorine and a urea linkage.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the molecule's property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.65**, considering:
- The dual amide/urea linkage adds polarity (similar to NC(=O)c1cccnc1: 0.491).
- The halogenated aromatic rings (F and Cl) push the value higher (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: 0.588).
- The urea group may slightly increase it further.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.65** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.08470018262600972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether groups tend to have moderately negative to near-zero property values. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate, not a pure ether but contains -O-) has a value of **0.53179669**.
     - `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` (a complex ether/amide) has a value of **-0.9193334**.
     - `Oc1ccccc1O` (catechol, with two -OH groups) has a value of **0.78321946**.
   - Ethers without strong polar or functionalized groups (like **CCCOC(C)C**) are likely to have values closer to zero or slightly negative.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Branched alkanes or ethers (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` with value **1.26614564**) tend to have higher (less negative) values than linear chains.
   - The molecule **CCCOC(C)C** is a branched ether (isopropyl group attached to the oxygen), which may push the value slightly higher than a linear ether.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCO` (1-propanol) is not in the list, but `CCCCCO` (1-pentanol) has a value of **-0.72939118**. Alcohols are more polar than ethers, so ethers might have less negative values.
   - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (branched alcohol) has a value of **1.23660212**, suggesting branching increases the value.
   - `CCCC(C)CO` (branched alcohol) has a value of **0.20719331**, which is closer to our ether's structure.

4. **Prediction for CCCOC(C)C**:
   - The ether group (-O-) is less polar than -OH, so the value should be less negative than alcohols.
   - The branching (isopropyl group) may increase the value slightly.
   - No strongly electronegative atoms (like F, Cl, or N) are present, so the value won't be highly negative.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above trends, **CCCOC(C)C** is expected to have a property value in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This aligns with the moderately positive values seen for branched, non-polar ethers in the examples.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1.5325591026734258
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often increases the property value (e.g., Cl-substituted aromatics like Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 have values like 0.58856456).
   - It has a **lactam-like structure (n1c(=O)[nH]c)** with two carbonyl groups (=O), which can decrease the property value due to polarity (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC has 0.54087013, but more polar groups can lower it further).
   - An **alkyl chain (CCC(C))** is present, which typically contributes positively but modestly (e.g., CCC(C)CC has 0.05962314).

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (polycyclic aromatic with N) has -0.47117652.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (Br-substituted aromatic with polar amide) has 0.02562379.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (di-chlorinated aromatic) has 0.58856456.
   - **CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C** (complex polycyclic with polar groups) has -2.26355412.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **Br** and **alkyl groups** suggests a moderate positive contribution.
   - The **polar lactam/carbonyl groups** will likely reduce the property value significantly.
   - The molecule is neither as polar as the lowest examples (e.g., -2.26) nor as nonpolar as the highest (e.g., 3.18).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the **electron-withdrawing Br and carbonyls** and the **electron-donating alkyl group**, the property value is likely **slightly negative but close to zero**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.25**  

This aligns with molecules like **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (-0.26369065) or **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (-0.47117652), but adjusted for the less conjugated/polar nature of the given structure.

---
**Final Answer**: **-0.25** (approximate prediction based on structural trends).

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.5049862565463299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values around **-0.3 to 0.5**, depending on substituents.
   - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more fused rings (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**) have more negative values (e.g., **-1.15865493**), likely due to increased conjugation and planarity.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a phenanthrene-like structure with a nitrogen substituent) has a value of **-0.73313499**.
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative with methyl groups) has a value of **0.22182955**.
   - The biphenyl structure is less conjugated than fused PAHs but more conjugated than single benzene rings.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl) tend to increase the property value (more positive).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., CH3, NH2) tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - The given molecule has no substituents, so the value will reflect the bare biphenyl system.

4. **Direct Comparison**:
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large PAH) has **-1.15865493**.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a smaller fused PAH) has **-0.73313499**.
   - Biphenyl is less conjugated than these fused systems, so its value should be less negative (closer to zero).

### Prediction for Biphenyl:
The biphenyl molecule (**c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**) consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, allowing some conjugation but not as much as fused rings. Given the examples:
- Single benzene rings with no substituents are not explicitly given, but substituted benzenes range from **-0.3 to 0.5**.
- Biphenyl is more conjugated than a single benzene but less than fused PAHs, so its value should be between **-0.5 and 0.0**.

A reasonable estimate is slightly negative due to mild conjugation but not as extreme as fused systems. From the examples, **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative) has **0.22182955**, but biphenyl is less conjugated than naphthalene. 

Thus, the predicted property value for biphenyl is approximately:  
**-0.45**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (estimated based on structural similarity to the given examples).

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -1.0116292991896547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butane-1-thiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes):**
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): **0.20612343**
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): **-0.01325799**
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with substituent): **-1.13631033**
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene): **-0.11202223**
   - **CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O)** (unsaturated ketone): **1.71632641**

   Hydrocarbons generally have values close to zero, with cyclic structures tending to be more negative.

2. **Sulfur-containing compounds:**
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**: **2.63545705** (complex thiophosphate)
   - **CCNC(=S)NCC**: **0.63174477** (thiourea derivative)
   - **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1**: **1.50697591** (thioamide)
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: **-0.55378203** (organophosphate with sulfur)

   Sulfur-containing molecules vary widely, but simple thiols or sulfides are not directly represented in the examples. However, sulfur tends to increase the property value unless paired with electronegative groups (e.g., Cl, O).

3. **Functional groups:**
   - **Alcohols (OH)**: Tend to have positive values (e.g., **CC(O)C(C)(C)C**: **1.5555883**).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)**: Often reduce the value (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: **-0.27346444**).
   - **Amides/carbonyls**: Can be positive or negative depending on context.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- **CCCCS** is a simple aliphatic thiol (butane-1-thiol). 
- It lacks cyclic or aromatic structures, which tend to lower the value.
- The sulfur atom is not highly oxidized (unlike sulfones or sulfonamides), so it may contribute a slight positive effect.
- Comparing to similar-sized hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**: **-0.01325799**), the presence of sulfur might push the value slightly higher.

Given these observations, I predict the property value for **CCCCS** to be in the range of **0.1 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCCC(S): 0.25** (specific value: **0.25000000**) 

This is based on the slight positive contribution of sulfur in an otherwise neutral hydrocarbon chain.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.236602118531695
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NHâ, -COOH) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. 
   - Nonpolar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains, halogens like Cl/Br) tend to increase the property value.
   - For example:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (tertiary alcohol with a long alkyl chain) has a high value of **1.23660212**.
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (secondary alcohol) has a value of **0.43795845**.
     - **CCCCOC** (ether) has a value of **-0.72939118**, showing that ethers can lower the value.

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - More branched alkyl chains (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**) tend to have higher values (e.g., **0.84714078** for **CCC(C)(C)C** and **1.06045217** for **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**).
   - Linear chains with polar groups (e.g., **CCCCOC**) have lower values.

3. **Specific Case for CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a branched primary alcohol (**-OH** group) with a **tert-butyl-like** structure (**CCCC(C)(C)**).
   - The presence of the **-OH** group will likely reduce the property value compared to a purely hydrocarbon analog (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)C**), but the bulky hydrophobic **tert-butyl** group will increase it.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (similar branching with -OH): **1.23660212**.
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (less branched): **0.43795845**.
     - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (no -OH, highly branched): **1.06045217**.

### Prediction:
- The molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is less branched than **CCCC(C)(O)CC** but more branched than **CC(C)CC(C)O**. 
- The **-OH** group will reduce the value slightly compared to a pure hydrocarbon, but the bulky **tert-butyl** group will keep it relatively high.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **0.8 and 1.2**, closer to **1.0** due to the balance of hydrophobicity and polarity.

### Final Predicted Value:
**1.05000000** (approximating based on the trends observed in similar molecules). 

This is close to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (1.06045217)** but slightly lower due to the **-OH** group's effect.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.2016453059317369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group (-CH3) attached to one of the rings.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **Naphthalene Core**: 
   - The molecule **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **0.52687257**.
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene, similar but not identical) has a property value of **0.42512442**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (dimethyl-substituted naphthalene) has a property value of **0.42512442** (same as above, likely a typo in the SMILES).

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Adding methyl groups tends to increase the property value slightly (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** has a value of **0.99796075**, and **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** has **0.85320088**).
   - However, in fused ring systems like naphthalene, the effect of methyl substitution seems less pronounced (e.g., **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** has **0.42512442**).

3. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - Fused rings (like naphthalene) tend to have lower property values than simple benzene rings unless functionalized with electron-donating groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** has **0.49162121**, while **c1ccccc1** has **0.52687257**).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Naphthalene-like structures with methyl substitution tend to have property values in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**.
- The methyl group here is likely to slightly increase the value compared to unsubstituted naphthalene (but not as much as in simpler aromatics like toluene).

A reasonable estimate for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (1-methylnaphthalene) would be close to the value for **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (which is **0.42512442**), but perhaps slightly higher due to the methyl group's position. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.45** (rounded from likely values between 0.4 and 0.5). 

This aligns with the trend observed in similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (two amide groups attached to a 5-membered ring, similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.43103241**).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **bulky branched alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**. 
   - The branched alkyl group is somewhat similar to **CC(C)C** (property = **-0.75847805**) but more extended.
   - The vinyl group is also present in **C1CCC=CC1** (property = **-0.88896009**), suggesting a slight negative contribution.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **0.43103241**). 
- The additional **branched alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC)** likely increases hydrophobicity slightly but may not drastically alter the property compared to the simpler **CC=C** substituent.
- The vinyl group's influence is modestly negative, but the bulky alkyl might offset this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** and the balance between the slightly more hydrophobic alkyl group and the vinyl group, the property value should be **close to the original example but slightly lower**.

**Predicted Property Value: 0.35** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

### Rationale:
- The additional branching and size of the alkyl group may slightly reduce the property value compared to the simpler analog (0.431), but not drastically.
- The value is still positive, as the hydantoin core dominates the behavior, and the substituents are not strongly polar or charged.

Thus, the predicted property for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is **0.35**.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.4623269122808235
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Not explicitly given, but derivatives provide clues.
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: 0.58856456 (electron-withdrawing halogens)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: -0.01192131 (multiple halogens, steric hindrance)
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.58856456 (similar to Cl/I, Br is also electron-withdrawing)
   - **COc1ccccc1O**: 0.53927351 (electron-donating methoxy and hydroxy groups)

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWG)**:
   - EWGs like halogens (Cl, Br, I) or **CF3** tend to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCC**: -1.0116293).
   - **CF3** is a strong EWG, similar to halogens but slightly more polar.

3. **Trifluoromethylbenzene (FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1)**:
   - The **CF3** group is highly electron-withdrawing, similar to halogens but with stronger inductive effects.
   - Comparing to **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (0.58856456) and **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (0.58856456), **CF3** is likely to give a comparable or slightly higher value due to its stronger -I effect.

4. **Steric Effects**:
   - **CF3** is bulkier than Cl or Br, but the given examples with multiple halogens (e.g., hexachlorobenzene: -0.01192131) suggest steric hindrance may lower the value slightly. However, **CF3** is less bulky than multiple halogens.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of **CF3** and its similarity to halogenated benzenes (which have values ~0.58), I predict the property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** to be slightly higher than halogenated benzenes but not excessively so due to sterics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.16804858985732682
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and overall hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. The molecule in question, **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, is a sugar derivative (specifically, a hexose sugar like glucose or galactose) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding.

From the examples:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a linear sugar alcohol like sorbitol) has a high property value of **2.3994887**, likely due to its high hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding capacity.
- Other highly polar or hydrogen-bonding molecules (e.g., those with multiple -OH or -NH groups) tend to have higher property values, while hydrophobic or less polar molecules (e.g., simple hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics) have lower or negative values.

The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** but is cyclic. Cyclization may slightly reduce the flexibility and accessibility of -OH groups compared to the linear form, but the overall polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity remain very high. 

Thus, the predicted property value should be **close to but slightly lower than 2.3994887**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: ~2.2**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measuredâe.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâthis is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -2.0127001596837677
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (similar to some of the provided examples like "CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C" and "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C"). These structures tend to have negative property values due to their size and complexity.
   - Example: "CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C" has a value of **-1.95027021**.
   - Example: "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C" has a value of **-2.1516556**.

2. **Polar functional groups**: The molecule contains multiple polar groups (carbonyls C=O, hydroxyls -OH, and ester groups -OCO-), which can influence the property. These groups often reduce the property value when present in large numbers.
   - Example: "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" (highly polar) has a value of **2.3994887**, but this is an outlier due to its extreme polarity. Most polar steroids in the examples have negative values.

3. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, which typically correlates with lower (more negative) property values in the given examples.

4. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - The closest matches are the steroid-like molecules with carbonyls and hydroxyls, which have values around **-1.95 to -2.15**.
   - This molecule has additional polar groups (ester and more hydroxyls), which may further reduce the property value slightly.

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid-like examples and the additional polar groups, the predicted property value is likely slightly more negative than the closest examples. 

**Prediction: -2.25** (rounded to two decimal places based on the trend observed in the examples). 

This aligns with the trend where larger, more polar, and more complex steroid-like structures have increasingly negative values.

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -2.063816687584175
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, halogens, etc.). The property appears to be a quantitative measure influenced by these structural attributes, possibly resembling logP (lipophilicity) or a similar descriptor.

### Analysis of the target molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**  

1. **Structure**: This is a steroid-like molecule with multiple fused rings, a ketone (C=O), and a hydroxyl group (OH).  
   - The **carbonyl (C=O)** and **hydroxyl (OH)** groups introduce polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.  
   - The **fused aliphatic rings** contribute hydrophobicity.  
   - The balance between polar groups and hydrophobic bulk suggests moderate polarity.  

2. **Comparison with examples**:  
   - Molecules with **OH groups and fused rings** (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`, property = **-1.922**) tend to have negative values.  
   - The **ketone** may slightly offset the hydrophilicity compared to pure hydroxylated cases.  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - The molecule is less polar than highly halogenated or aromatic examples but more polar than purely aliphatic ones.  
   - Given the steroid-like core and polar groups, the property likely falls in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other hydroxylated polycyclics.  

### Predicted property value:  
**-1.45**  

This estimate balances the hydrophobic fused-ring system against the polar C=O and OH groups, aligning with trends in the provided data.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.16468010080849932
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Attached to the benzene ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The acetamide group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, reducing electron density on the ring.
   - The combination of these groups suggests moderate polarity but no extreme hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (0.32795571): Contains an aldehyde and methoxy group on benzene; moderately polar.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (0.49162121): Nitrobenzene; similar to our molecule but lacks the acetamide group.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (0.75728817): Nitro and methoxy on benzene; slightly higher than nitrobenzene alone.
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1** (not in examples, but similar): Acetamide + phenyl; likely less polar than nitro-substituted.

   Our molecule has both acetamide and nitro groups, which are polar but not as extreme as some highly polar or charged groups in the dataset (e.g., sulfonamides or quaternary amines).

4. **Trends**:
   - Nitro groups tend to give values around 0.4â0.8 when on benzene.
   - Acetamide is less polar than nitro but still contributes to a positive value.
   - No strongly hydrophobic (high positive) or charged (very negative) features are present.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.52**  

This balances the contributions of the acetamide (slightly positive) and nitro (moderately positive) groups. It is higher than nitrobenzene alone (0.49) but lower than methoxy-nitrobenzene (0.75) due to the acetamide being less polar than methoxy.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.8936714439764976
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. Similar phosphoryl or thiophosphoryl groups in the examples are not present, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CSSC**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., **CSSC: -1.42194855**).
2. **Aromatic heterocycle with Cl substitution (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The molecule contains a fused aromatic system with a lactam (c(=O)) and an ether (o), similar to some of the complex heterocycles in the examples.
   - Chlorine substitution (Cl) on the aromatic ring is present in several examples. Cl-substituted aromatics tend to have property values in the range of **0.36 to 0.84** (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12: 0.36180794**, **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1: 0.84178131**), but when combined with other polar groups, the value can be lower or negative.
3. **Thioether linkage (SC)**: The **S** atom is part of a thioether, which is somewhat polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as a sulfoxide or sulfone. Sulfur-containing groups in the examples (e.g., **CSSC: -1.42194855**) tend to lower the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is structurally complex, combining a phosphorothioate, a chlorinated aromatic heterocycle, and a thioether. 
- Similar complex molecules with polar/electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3: -2.03347629**, **COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3: -1.51443742**) have strongly negative property values.
- The presence of **Cl** might offset this slightly, but the overall polarity and sulfur/phosphorus contributions likely dominate.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of:
- Phosphorothioate (moderately negative contribution),
- Chlorinated aromatic (slightly positive contribution),
- Thioether and lactam (negative contributions),
the property value is likely in the range of **-1.0 to -1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is **-1.25**. 

### Final Answer:
**-1.25** (approximate prediction based on structural similarity to the provided examples).

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.847140781615469
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: Property = 0.04537865  
     (7-carbon chain with a branched -OH)
   - **CC(C)CO**: Property = -0.34837922  
     (shorter branched chain with -OH)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: Property = 2.3994887  
     (polyol with multiple -OH groups, very high value)
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = 0.37407101  
     (mid-chain -OH, moderate value)
   - **CCCCC(CC)CO**: Property = 0.7022156  
     (longer branched chain with -OH, higher value)

2. **Branched vs. Linear Chains**:
   - Branched alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)CO**) tend to have lower values than linear or less-branched alcohols (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O** or **CCCCC(CC)CO**).

3. **Tertiary Alcohols vs. Primary Alcohols**:
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is a primary alcohol (like **CC(C)CO**), but with more branching (tert-butyl group). Increased branching typically reduces the property value further (as seen with **CC(C)CO** being lower than less-branched alcohols).

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) and sulfonamides (**S(=O)(=O)N**) tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., **ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O** = 2.03064294).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) have mixed effects but often reduce the value (e.g., **BrC(Br)Br** = -0.75847805).

### Prediction for **CC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a primary alcohol with a highly branched tert-butyl group (**C(C)(C)C**). 
- Compared to **CC(C)CO** (property = -0.34837922), the additional branching in **CC(C)(C)CO** would likely reduce the property value further.
- However, the effect of branching is not strictly additive, so the decrease may not be drastic.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CC(C)(C)CO** is slightly lower than **CC(C)CO**, likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.5**. 

A specific predicted value could be:  
**-0.42** (reflecting increased branching but similar -OH influence). 

However, looking at the examples more closely, **CC(C)CO** is already quite low (-0.348), and further branching might not reduce it much more. Alternatively, it could be similar or slightly higher due to the bulky tert-butyl group's steric effects (though this is speculative). 

Given the data, a conservative estimate is:  
**-0.38** (close to **CC(C)CO** but accounting for slightly more branching). 

But to align with the trend of branching reducing the value, let's refine to:  
**-0.40**. 

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.40** (approximate, based on branching and alcohol trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.7034812642253994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Systems**:
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings (e.g., purine-like or imidazole-like structures) tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**.
   - Example: `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a value of **1.16572323**, and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` has a value of **1.05419206**.

2. **Presence of Carbonyl (C=O) Groups**:
   - Carbonyl groups in heterocycles (e.g., amides or lactams) often increase the property value slightly, especially when conjugated with nitrogen.

3. **Specific Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule is a **purine-2,6-dione** (hypoxanthine-like structure) with two carbonyl groups and multiple nitrogens in fused rings.
   - This is structurally similar to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`, but with an additional fused ring and carbonyl group.

4. **Comparison with Closest Examples**:
   - The closest analogs are the nitrogen-rich heterocycles with carbonyls, which have values around **1.0 to 1.2**.
   - The additional ring fusion and carbonyl in the target molecule may slightly increase the value compared to simpler imidazole derivatives.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is:

**1.254** (approximate, likely in the range of 1.2 to 1.3). 

This aligns with the trend observed for similar nitrogen-rich aromatic systems with carbonyl groups.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.17359497927026749
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -O-, -N-, halogens) tend to have a range of property values, but no clear linear trend is evident.
   - For example:
     - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of **-0.75847805**.
     - **CCOC=C** (ethyl vinyl ether) has a value of **-0.61035657**.
     - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...** (a complex polyether) has a very negative value (**-2.66984905**), suggesting that multiple polar groups may drive the value downward.

2. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - Esters (R-COO-R') and carbonyl-containing compounds show varied values:
     - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate) has a high positive value (**2.25371039**), but this is a phosphate ester, which is atypical.
     - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...** (a steroid-like molecule) has a negative value (**-2.02630639**), but this is likely due to its large, complex structure.
     - Simpler carbonyls like **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid) are not in the examples, but **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (an amide) has a near-zero value (**0.02562379**).

3. **Simple Esters**:
   - The closest analog to **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate) in the examples is **CCOC=C** (ethyl vinyl ether), which has a value of **-0.61035657**. However, this is an ether, not an ester.
   - Esters are more polar than ethers due to the carbonyl group, but the direction of the effect isn't clear from the examples.

4. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is a small, polar ester with no additional functional groups. Given that:
     - Isopropanol (**CC(C)O**) is somewhat negative (**-0.75847805**).
     - Ethyl vinyl ether (**CCOC=C**) is also negative (**-0.61035657**).
     - The ester group might add slight polarity but not as much as a phosphate or polyether.
   - I would expect the value to be moderately negative, similar to other small polar molecules but not as extreme as large or polyfunctional ones.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**-0.45**  

This is based on:
- The negative trend for small polar molecules like **CC(C)O** and **CCOC=C**.
- The ester group likely not pushing the value as negative as polyethers or large steroids.
- No strong positive influences (like phosphate or nitro groups) are present.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -1.4648133169742565
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (i.e., **N,N'-diphenylurea**). The structure is:
   ```
   O=C(N-Ph)(N-Ph)
   ```
   where "Ph" represents a phenyl ring.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The urea group (**C=O(N)(N)**) is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (though here it's substituted with aromatic rings, reducing H-bonding potential).
   - Two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) contribute hydrophobicity and Ï-Ï stacking interactions.
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents are present on the phenyl rings (just plain benzene).

3. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **Urea-like structures**: 
     - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (property = -0.7206): A cyclic urea with aliphatic substituents, more polar and flexible, leading to a negative value.
     - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (property = 0.4916): A smaller urea-like amide with an aromatic ring, moderately positive.
   - **Aromatic systems**:
     - `c1ccncc1` (pyridine, property = 0.5269): A simple aromatic heterocycle with a positive value.
     - `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (methylnaphthalene, property = 0.3618): A fused aromatic system with moderate hydrophobicity.
   - **Diphenyl-like structures**:
     - `N,N'-diphenylurea` is more hydrophobic than urea but less so than pure hydrocarbons due to the polar carbonyl.

4. **Expected Property**:
   - The presence of the polar urea core will pull the value toward the middle of the range, while the two phenyl rings add hydrophobicity. 
   - The lack of strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups suggests a moderate value, similar to other aromatic amides/ureas in the dataset.
   - From the examples, aromatic + polar groups tend to fall in the **0.2 to 0.6 range**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is:  
**0.45** (specific value: **0.4500**).

This aligns with the trend of aromatic polar compounds in the dataset (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` at 0.4916 and `c1ccncc1` at 0.5269), while accounting for the slightly reduced polarity due to the phenyl substituents.

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.7642983867881192
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused benzene rings.

From the examples:
- Aromatic systems with multiple fused rings tend to have negative property values (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` has a value of **-0.99935024**, and `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has **-2.03347629**).
- Fluorene is structurally similar to these fused aromatic systems but lacks highly polar or electronegative substituents (like -NOâ, -Cl, or -SOâH), which would further lower the value.

Comparing to `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH with a value of **-0.99935024**), fluorene is slightly smaller but still highly aromatic. Thus, its value should be slightly less negative but still in a similar range.

**Predicted property value for fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13): ~ -0.85**  
*(Likely between -0.8 and -1.0 based on the trend in the examples.)*  

**Final answer: -0.85** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.6171349520345718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, acidic/basic properties).
   - **Aromatic ring with -NH2**: Aniline-like (polar, basic).
   - The molecule is highly polar with multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., sulfonamides, amines, or multiple heteroatoms) tend to have negative property values in the dataset. For example:
     - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (polar, cyclic sulfonamide-like): **-0.9189655**
     - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (polar, cyclic amide): **-0.05348972**
     - **CNN** (small polar molecule): **-2.07155559**
   - The presence of the sulfonamide (**S(=O)(=O)**) and aromatic amine (**c1ccc(N)cc1**) suggests significant polarity, similar to other negatively valued examples.
   - The guanidine-like group (**NC(=N)N**) adds additional polarity and basicity, which may further lower the property value.

3. **Expected Property Value**:
   - Given the high polarity and multiple functional groups, the property value is likely negative and moderately large in magnitude (similar to other polar sulfonamide/amine-containing molecules in the dataset).
   - A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.8 and -1.3**, closer to the more polar examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-1.05** (a mid-range estimate based on the structural similarity to other polar molecules in the dataset). 

This prediction balances the contributions from the sulfonamide, aromatic amine, and guanidine-like groups, which collectively suggest a moderately negative property value.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.9349168642735879
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features such as functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular complexity. Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`

### Key Features:
1. **Nitro Groups (`N(=O)=O`):**  
   - The molecule has two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), which are strongly electron-withdrawing. In the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.6597382**).  
   - However, when combined with other features (e.g., halogens or complex structures), the effect may be moderated or reversed.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (`C(F)(F)F`):**  
   - The `CF3` group is highly electronegative and lipophilic. In the examples, fluorinated groups (e.g., `C2(F)` in steroids) often correlate with negative property values (e.g., **-1.83423248** for a fluorinated steroid).  

3. **Tertiary Amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`):**  
   - Tertiary amines (e.g., `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`) tend to have moderately positive or near-zero property values (e.g., **0.02980724**).  

4. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents:**  
   - The presence of an aromatic ring with multiple substituents (nitro and `CF3`) suggests reduced property values compared to simpler aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has **0.56767417**, but substitution lowers this).  

5. **Overall Polarity and Size:**  
   - The molecule is polar due to nitro and `CF3` groups but also has hydrophobic regions (alkyl chains). Larger, more complex molecules with polar groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., **-0.92991419** for `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (nitro + halogen + complex structure): **-0.92991419**  
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` (amide + aromatic): **-0.06643013**  
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (nitro + phenol): **0.6597382**  

The given molecule is more similar to the first example (nitro + halogen + complex), but with an additional nitro group and `CF3` (stronger electron-withdrawing effects). This suggests a property value more negative than **-0.92991419** but not as extreme as large steroids (e.g., **-1.83423248**).

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the predicted value is:  
**-0.85**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on qualitative trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be required.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.17359497927026749
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Ester (COO)**: The molecule has a formate ester group (**OC=O**), where the carbonyl (C=O) is directly attached to an oxygen (O) that is part of an alkyl group (isopropoxy, **OC(C)C**).
   - **Branched Alkyl Group**: The **isopropoxy** group (**OC(C)C**) is branched, which may influence the property.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide): Property = 0.15248693. Contains a carbonyl (C=O) with an attached heteroatom (N).
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (branched ester): Property = 0.17332492. This is structurally very similar to **CC(C)OC=O**, with a slightly longer alkyl chain.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with aromatic): Property = 0.05878292. Less similar due to the aromatic ring.
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (linear ester): Property = 0.20158243. Similar to our target but with a linear alkyl chain.

### Key Observations:
- Esters (**OC=O**) tend to have property values in the range of **0.1 to 0.3** (e.g., 0.173 for **CC(C)CCOC=O**, 0.202 for **CCCCCOC(=O)C**).
- Branching (e.g., **CC(C)**) does not drastically change the value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CCOC=O** vs. **CCCCCOC(=O)C**).
- The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., **N**) can slightly lower the value (e.g., **CC(=O)N** = 0.152).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (property = 0.17332492), but with a slightly shorter and simpler structure (**CC(C)OC=O**), the property value is likely in the same range but marginally lower due to reduced size and no additional alkyl extension.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.15** (approximate, likely between 0.14 and 0.17). 

For specificity, we can estimate:  
**Predicted value for CC(C)OC=O = 0.16**.  

This aligns with the trend observed for small, branched esters in the dataset.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.8417813122608622
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **4-methyl-2-cresol** (a methyl-substituted phenol with the SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1). Key features:
1. **Phenol core (aromatic ring with -OH group)**: Phenols in the dataset (e.g., `c1ccccc1O`, `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`) have property values ranging from **0.56767417** (simple phenol) to **-1.34747767** (complex polyphenol). The presence of -OH tends to increase hydrophilicity or polarity, but the exact effect depends on other substituents.
2. **Methyl groups (-CH3)**: Methyl groups are present in many molecules, and their effect varies. For example:
   - `CC(C)C` (isobutane) has a value of **-0.75847805** (nonpolar, aliphatic).
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (toluene derivative) has a value of **0.67449076** (aromatic with methyl).
3. **Substitution pattern**: The molecule has two methyl groups (positions 1 and 3) and one -OH (position 4). This is somewhat similar to `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (methyl gallate, value **0.91411213**), but with fewer -OH groups and more -CH3 groups.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **0.56767417**
- `Cc1ccccc1C` (p-xylene): **0.53927351**
- `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (toluene derivative): **0.67449076**

The target molecule is intermediate between phenol and xylene in terms of substituents. The -OH will increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the two -CH3 groups will decrease it slightly due to their hydrophobic nature.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is likely slightly lower than phenol but higher than xylene. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.48** (range: 0.45 to 0.55)

### Rationale:
- Phenol: 0.567
- p-Xylene: 0.539
- Target: Between these, but closer to phenol due to the -OH group. The second -CH3 pulls the value down slightly. 

Thus, **0.48** is a balanced prediction based on the dataset trends.

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.34632101989852593
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) consistently have a property value of **0.64808162**. This suggests that the phosphorothioate group strongly influences the property, likely due to its polarizable sulfur atom and bulky substituents.

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - The property seems less sensitive to the specific halogen (Cl, Br, I) or substituents on the aromatic ring when the phosphorothioate group is present. For example, replacing halogens with other groups doesn't drastically change the value (as seen in the examples where Cl, Br, or I substitutions yield the same value).

3. **Thioether (SC) and Methyl (C) Substituents**:
   - The given molecule has a **thioether (SC)** and a **methyl (C)** group on the aromatic ring. While these are not identical to the halogens in the examples, they are moderately polarizable and bulky, similar to halogens. Thus, they may not significantly alter the property value from the phosphorothioate baseline.

4. **Lack of Strong Electron-Withdrawing or Donating Groups**:
   - The **SC** and **C** substituents are not as strongly electron-withdrawing as halogens or nitro groups, nor as electron-donating as hydroxyl or amino groups. This further supports the idea that the property value will remain close to the phosphorothioate baseline.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment in determining the property value (as seen in the examples), and the fact that the aromatic substituents (**SC** and **C**) are not drastically different in electronic or steric effects compared to the halogens in the training data, the predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is likely very close to the phosphorothioate examples.

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.64808162** (same as the other phosphorothioate-containing molecules). 

### Note:
If the training data had shown significant variation due to aromatic substituents (e.g., hydroxyl or nitro groups causing large shifts), we would adjust accordingly. However, the consistency of the phosphorothioate examples suggests the substituents here are secondary in influence.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.09780747934292637
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy halogenation (Cl)**: The molecule is highly chlorinated, similar to some examples like:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property: 0.05889441)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property: 0.27141661)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: 1.39278252)

2. **Biphenyl-like structure**: The molecule consists of two chlorinated benzene rings connected directly (no linker). This is similar to the first two examples above, which also have biphenyl cores with heavy chlorination.

3. **Symmetry and substitution pattern**: The chlorines are distributed symmetrically on both rings, which may influence the property. 

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are the two biphenyl-like chlorinated structures with property values of **0.05889441** and **0.27141661**. 
- The molecule here has slightly more chlorination than the first example (which has 6 Cl atoms) but less than the second example (which has 8 Cl atoms). 
- The presence of more chlorines generally increases the property value (as seen in the trend from 0.058 to 0.271), but the exact positioning also matters. Here, the chlorines are not as densely packed as in the second example.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the biphenyl chlorinated examples, the property value is likely between the two closest examples. A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the first example but lower than the second, reflecting the intermediate level of chlorination. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.15** (approximately midway between 0.058 and 0.271). 

### Refinement:
Looking at **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: 1.392), we see that very dense chlorination on a single ring can lead to much higher values. However, in this case, the chlorines are split across two rings, so the effect is less pronounced. Thus, the value should remain closer to the biphenyl examples.

**Final predicted property value: 0.15** (with an expected range of 0.1 to 0.25). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends from the given data.)

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.206123426997196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher (more positive) property values. For example:
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (two nitrile groups): **1.06856276**
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (three nitro groups): **1.26321073**
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups): **1.85626119**
   - The presence of nitro groups seems to increase the property value significantly.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`, `CC`) tend to have very low (negative) property values:
     - `CCC`: **-2.07155559**
     - `CC`: **-3.27475897**
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC`) have slightly higher but still negative values: **-0.2428006**.

3. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` has a short alkyl chain (propyl, `CCC`) and a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).
   - From the examples, the nitro group's positive contribution likely outweighs the negative contribution of the short alkyl chain.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups + longer alkyl/aryl): **1.85626119**
- `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (three nitro groups): **1.26321073**
- `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (two nitrile groups): **1.06856276**
- `CCCN(=O)=O` has only one nitro group and a short alkyl chain, so its value should be lower than the above but still positive.

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contribution of the nitro group and the modest negative contribution of the propyl chain, a reasonable estimate for `CCCN(=O)=O` is around **0.8 to 1.2**. 

Looking at the closest analogies:
- `Nc1ccccc1O` (phenyl with NH and OH): **0.78321946**
- `Fc1ccccc1Br` (phenyl with F and Br): **0.78321946**
- `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (two nitriles): **1.06856276**

Since `CCCN(=O)=O` has one nitro group (less than the two nitriles or nitro groups in other examples) but no aromatic stabilization, a value slightly lower than `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` is reasonable.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for `CCCN(=O)=O` is **0.92**. 

This is based on:
- The nitro group's strong positive contribution (~+1.0 to +1.2).
- The propyl chain's modest negative contribution (~-0.2 to -0.3).
- Balancing these effects gives ~0.9, rounded to **0.92**.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen-Substituted Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = 0.58856456  
     (Chlorine and Bromine on benzene ring)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = -0.18937689  
     (Multiple chlorines reduce the property compared to single substitutions)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: Property = 0.53927351  
     (Chlorine + methoxy group on benzene)
   - **BrC(Br)Br**: Property = -0.75847805  
     (Non-aromatic bromine substitution lowers the property significantly)

2. **Fluorine Substitution**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: Property = 0.02562379  
     (Fluorine on benzene with an amide group)
   - Fluorine is less common in the examples, but it tends to have a moderate effect.

3. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = 0.58856456  
     (Bromine + chlorine on benzene)
   - **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: Property = 0.20164531  
     (Bromine on a fused aromatic system)

4. **Mono-Substituted vs. Di-Substituted**:
   - Mono-substituted halogens (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**) tend to have higher property values than di- or tri-substituted halogens (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**).

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- This is a benzene ring with **fluorine (F)** and **bromine (Br)** substitutions, similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = 0.58856456), but with fluorine instead of chlorine.
- Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine but less bulky, so its effect might be slightly different. 
- Comparing to **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (property = 0.02562379), fluorine alone reduces the property, but bromine tends to increase it (as seen in **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**).
- The presence of both F and Br suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing (F) and polarizability (Br).

### Estimated Property:
Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (0.58856456) but with fluorine replacing chlorine, we might expect a slightly lower value due to fluorine's stronger electron-withdrawing effect. 

**Predicted property for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: ~0.45**  
(A reasonable estimate based on the closest analogs.) 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **COc1ccccc1Cl** (0.53927351) and **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (0.58856456), replacing Cl with F (smaller, more electronegative) might reduce the property by ~0.1, leading to:

**Final predicted value: 0.48**  
(Closer to the bromine-substituted aromatic trend but adjusted for fluorine.) 

Thus, the predicted property for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is approximately **0.48**.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.6207354845364524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -Br, -Cl) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. 
     - Example: `CBr` has -3.274, `CCCCBr` has -1.011, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` has -0.426.
   - Molecules with nonpolar or weakly polar groups (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings without polar substituents) tend to have higher (more positive) property values.
     - Example: `CCCC(C)(C)O` has 0.820, `CC(C)(C)CO` has 0.847.

2. **Ring Systems**:
   - Saturated ring systems (e.g., cyclohexane derivatives) with polar substituents (e.g., -OH) tend to have moderately negative values.
     - Example: `CC1CCCO1` has -1.023, `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO` has -2.064.
   - Unsaturated or aromatic rings with polar groups can have very negative values, especially if multiple polar groups are present.

3. **Specific Case of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**:
   - This is a bicyclic saturated hydrocarbon with a tertiary alcohol (-OH) and two quaternary carbons (bulky alkyl groups).
   - The presence of -OH introduces polarity, but the bulky alkyl groups (quaternary carbons) reduce the overall polarity.
   - Similar molecules:
     - `CC(C)(C)CO` (tertiary alcohol with bulky alkyl groups) has a high value: 0.847.
     - `CC1CCCO1` (saturated ring with -OH) has -1.023.
   - This molecule is intermediate: less polar than `CC1CCCO1` due to more alkyl substitution but more polar than `CC(C)(C)CO` due to ring strain and additional -OH.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar -OH group and the nonpolar bulky alkyl/ring structure, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be necessary.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.518212647390944
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, which has a property value of **-0.86333847**. The presence of P(=S) suggests a moderately negative contribution to the property.
2. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (similar to a phthalimide-like structure), which is also present in the reference molecule above. Such groups often contribute to polarity and may lower the property value.
3. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are relatively neutral in terms of extreme contributions but may slightly increase solubility or polarity.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The reference molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a value of **-0.86333847**. Our target molecule is very similar but lacks the **SC(CCl)** substituent, which might slightly reduce the electron-withdrawing or steric effects. 
- Other molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23**, value **-0.77621286**) also fall in a similar range.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the reference molecule with **P(=S)** and the lactam ring, but with slightly fewer electronegative substituents (no **Cl** or **S** in the side chain), the property value should be slightly less negative than **-0.86333847**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-0.78** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples).

### Final Answer:
**-0.78**

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.06617094781214729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, fused rings) tend to have negative property values unless they are heavily substituted with electron-donating or bulky groups.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.560) has two aromatic rings and a carbonyl, yielding a moderately negative value.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (especially in conjugation with aromatic systems) often reduces the property value.
   - Example: `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = -0.711) has two conjugated carbonyl-aromatic systems.

3. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen/Oxygen**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) often lower the property value, especially if they are part of a conjugated system.
   - Example: `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` (property = 0.441) is an indole, but the property is slightly positive due to the lack of additional electronegative groups.

4. **Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, =O) tend to decrease the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl groups like -CH3) tend to increase the property value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, which has:
- A central **diketopiperazine-like** structure (two nitrogens and a carbonyl in a 6-membered ring).
- A fused benzene ring (c2ccccc2).
- Two methyl groups (electron-donating).
- A carbonyl group (C=O) in conjugation with the aromatic system.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.560):
   - Similar structure: two aromatic rings, a carbonyl, and nitrogen heterocycle.
   - The target molecule has an additional carbonyl and a more rigid fused system, which may further reduce the property value.

2. `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (property = 0.614):
   - This is a diketopiperazine derivative with alkyl groups, which increases the property value.
   - The target molecule lacks bulky alkyl groups but has aromatic conjugation, which would lower the value.

3. `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = 1.765):
   - This is a simple amide with two methyl groups, giving a very high value.
   - The target molecule has more conjugation and aromaticity, which would counteract this effect.

### Prediction:
Given the conjugation, aromaticity, and carbonyl group, the property value is likely **negative**. The closest analog is `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.560), but the target molecule has an additional carbonyl and a more rigid fused system, which would further reduce the value. 

However, the two methyl groups (electron-donating) would partially offset this effect. Thus, the predicted value should be slightly more negative than -0.560 but not as extreme as some highly conjugated systems (e.g., `C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54`, property = -1.180).

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.65** (rounded to -0.7 if preferring one decimal place). 

This balances the effects of the conjugated carbonyl-aromatic system (reducing the value) and the electron-donating methyl groups (increasing it slightly).

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is **-0.65**.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.6264281594936748
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Saturation**:
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isobutene, unsaturated hydrocarbon): **0.23676802**
   - **CCCCC** (pentane, saturated hydrocarbon): **-1.0116293**
   - Longer saturated hydrocarbons tend to have more negative values, while unsaturation increases the value.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol, polyol): **1.08281967** (highly positive due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate, phosphate ester): **2.25371039** (very high due to the phosphate group).
   - **COC(=O)N** (methyl carbamate): **0.20612343** (moderate, due to ester and amide).
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like ketone/ester): **-2.09372024** (very negative, likely due to complex ring structure and ketone).
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate, ester): **0.76638801** (positive, ester contribution).

3. **Esters**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CC(C)OC(=O)C**: 0.766, **CCOC(=O)N**: 0.206) tend to have moderately positive values.
   - The presence of **C(=O)O** (carboxylate/ester) seems to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Halogens**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) introduce variability but generally do not dominate over functional groups like esters or alcohols.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **ethyl hexanoate**, a simple ester with a 6-carbon chain and an ethoxy group.
- It has:
  - A saturated carbon chain (**CCCCCC**), which would contribute negatively (like pentane: **-1.011**).
  - An ester group (**C(=O)OCC**), which would contribute positively (like isopropyl acetate: **0.766** or methyl carbamate: **0.206**).
- The net effect is likely a balance between the negative contribution of the alkyl chain and the positive contribution of the ester.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): **0.76638801** (shorter chain, ester).
- **CCCCC** (pentane): **-1.0116293** (pure hydrocarbon).
- **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** has a longer chain than isopropyl acetate but is still dominated by the ester group. The value should be slightly lower than isopropyl acetate due to the longer alkyl chain.

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends, I estimate the property for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** to be **~0.5**, balancing the ester's positive contribution and the alkyl chain's negative contribution. 

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (approximate, likely between 0.4 and 0.6).

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.24674541662299065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group patterns that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-0.05666276**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, differing only by one fewer carbon in the ester group (methyl instead of ethyl).

2. **Effect of Ester Group**:
   - Esters (R-COO-R') with aromatic rings tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - Ethyl benzoate: **-0.05666276**
     - Larger aromatic esters (e.g., **CCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC**) have more negative values (**-0.42033478**), likely due to increased hydrophobicity or size.

3. **Methyl vs. Ethyl Substituent**:
   - Methyl groups often slightly increase the property value compared to ethyl (shorter chain = less hydrophobic contribution). For example:
     - **CC(C)(C)CCO** (tert-butanol derivative): **0.82052973**
     - **CCC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol): **0.84714078**
   - Thus, methyl benzoate should have a slightly higher (less negative) value than ethyl benzoate.

4. **Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**) have values around **-0.35 to -0.42**.
   - Aromatic esters are less negative than halogenated aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyl benzoate: **-0.05666276**
- Methyl benzoate is structurally similar but with a smaller alkyl group (methyl instead of ethyl), which typically increases the property value slightly (less negative).

Thus, the predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is approximately:  
**0.0** (slightly higher than ethyl benzoate, likely in the range **-0.02 to +0.05**).  

For specificity, I will predict:  
**0.01** (very close to zero, reflecting the minimal difference between methyl and ethyl esters in this context).  

However, since the examples show ethyl benzoate at **-0.056** and no direct methyl analogue is provided, a conservative estimate would be slightly less negative:  
**-0.03** (interpolating between ethyl benzoate and smaller esters).  

Given the data, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.03** (rounded to two decimal places).  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.03**.

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.13240052430167842
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (but-2-ene): Property value = **-0.19084541**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property value = **0.50985441**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): Property value = **-0.20513169**

   The presence of double bonds (especially conjugated systems) tends to increase the property value compared to saturated hydrocarbons. For example:
   - **CCCCCCC(=O)OCC** (saturated ester): **0.60371432**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, conjugated): **0.50985441**

2. **Conjugated Dienes**:
   - **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene) is a conjugated diene, which is more polarizable and has stronger Ï-electron delocalization than isolated double bonds (like **C/C=C/C**). This typically leads to a higher property value than non-conjugated alkenes but lower than aromatic systems.

3. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (isolated double bond): **-0.19084541**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (conjugated with aromatic ring): **0.50985441**
   - **C=CCC=C** (conjugated diene) should lie between these two, closer to the isolated double bond but slightly higher due to conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given the conjugation in 1,3-butadiene, its property value should be higher than **C/C=C/C** (-0.19084541) but lower than **C=Cc1ccccc1** (0.50985441). A reasonable estimate is slightly above zero, reflecting the intermediate effect of conjugation.

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: ~0.15**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- Non-conjugated alkene: **-0.19**
- Conjugated diene (predicted): Slightly positive, e.g., **0.15**
- Aromatic/conjugated: **0.51**

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.15** (approximate; exact value depends on finer structural effects). 

For consistency with the examples, I'll round to:  
**0.15000000**
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.7584780452032995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a highly halogenated molecule with F, Cl, and Br) has a high property value of **1.5555883**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (perchlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **0.27141661**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.0702292**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is fully brominated (similar to highly halogenated examples), suggesting a positive but not extreme value.

2. **Electronegativity and Size of Halogens**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than fluorine but larger and more polarizable. Fully brominated compounds (like **BrC(Br)Br**) are expected to have moderate property values due to their polarizability and molecular weight.

3. **Simple Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCC=O** (non-halogenated) has a value of **-0.80971405**, while halogenation increases the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** at **0.58856456**).
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is simpler than the perhalogenated examples but more halogenated than monohalogenated cases, so its value should be between **0.5 and 1.5**.

4. **Comparison to FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**:
   - This molecule has mixed halogens (F, Cl, Br) and a value of **1.5555883**. **BrC(Br)Br** is fully brominated but lacks fluorine, so its value should be slightly lower.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **BrC(Br)Br** is expected to have a property value in the range of **1.2 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.35** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar halogenated compounds). 

However, looking more closely at the fully brominated nature and comparing to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**, a slightly lower value is plausible. A more precise estimate would be:

**Final predicted property value: 1.25** (reflecting its fully brominated but less electronegative nature compared to fluorinated analogs). 

Given the examples, a value close to **1.3** is most consistent. 

### Exact Prediction:
After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is:

**1.28**

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.8633384737494688
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group. Similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) in the examples have property values around **0.22667713**, suggesting this group contributes positively but not extremely so.
2. **Thioether linkage (SC(CCl))**: The presence of sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl) can increase the property value, as seen in molecules like **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (1.81172665)** or **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.17724393)**. However, the effect is tempered by other groups.
3. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a rigid, planar aromatic system with a polar amide/carbonyl group. Similar structures (e.g., **Nc2cccc3nc1ccccc1cc23**) have negative values (e.g., **-0.36164252**), but the exact effect depends on substitution.
4. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as halogens or highly polar groups.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines features from **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.22667713)** and **Nc2cccc3nc1ccccc1cc23 (-0.36164252)**, with additional contributions from the Cl and aromatic systems.
- The phosphorothioate and Cl likely push the value higher, while the lactam and aromaticity may pull it down slightly.
- The overall structure is more complex than most examples, but the balance of polar/groups suggests a value in the low-to-moderate positive range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.45**  

This balances the contributions of the phosphorothioate (+), Cl (+), and lactam/aromatic (-) effects. The value is higher than **0.22667713** (due to the additional Cl and aromaticity) but not as extreme as purely halogenated molecules. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.6685595051099952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide group**: `CN(C)C(=O)N` â Similar to `CN(C)C(=O)C` (property = 1.016) and `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = 1.765). Amides with additional substitutions tend to increase the property value.
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` â Similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.533) and `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (property = -0.620). Chloro-substituted aromatics often have moderately negative to positive values.
   - **Heterocyclic fragment**: `n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` â This resembles complex heterocycles like `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (property = -0.075) or `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (property = -0.853). Such fragments often reduce the property value.
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` â Bulky alkyl groups (e.g., `CC=C(C)C`, property = 0.799) can increase the value, but here it's attached to a heterocycle, which may offset this.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The molecule has polar amide and heterocyclic carbonyl groups, which could lower the property (similar to other polar molecules like `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`, property = -0.092).
   - The chloro substituent on the aromatic ring adds electronegativity, potentially reducing the value further.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog might be `CN(C)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2` (not explicitly listed, but similar to `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2`, property = -1.732), where an amide is linked to an aromatic system via a linker. This suggests a negative value.
   - The presence of the heterocycle (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) is similar to `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (property = -0.853), reinforcing a negative trend.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The amide and chloro-aromatic fragments suggest a value between -0.5 and -1.5.
- The heterocycle and bulky tert-butyl group may push the value further negative, similar to other complex heterocycles (~-0.8 to -1.7).
- The lack of strongly positive contributors (e.g., simple alkyl chains) rules out values > 0.5.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is **-1.25**. This balances the moderately negative contributions from the polar/heterocyclic components and the slight positive influence of the bulky alkyl group.

**Final Answer**: -1.25

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.780436596404211
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule consists of two phenol rings (aromatic rings with -OH groups) linked by an ether bridge (O). Each ring is substituted with chlorine atoms:
   - First ring: 2-chloro, 4-hydroxy (and linked to the second ring via the oxygen at position 1).
   - Second ring: 2,5-dichloro (positions relative to the ether linkage).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of **multiple Cl substituents** (3 in total) and **two OH groups**.
   - Symmetrical, polar, and likely to exhibit moderate hydrogen bonding (from OH) and halogen effects (from Cl).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = **0.85320088**  
  (One phenol ring with 2,4-dichloro substitution; similar but simpler).
- **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **1.39278252**  
  (One phenol ring with 2,3,4,5-tetrachloro substitution; more Cl atoms increase the value).
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**: Property = **-0.18533556**  
  (Less polar, no OH groups; lower value).

### Trends Observed:
1. **OH groups** tend to increase the property (hydrogen bonding contribution).
2. **Cl substituents** generally increase the property, especially when multiple are present.
3. **Symmetry and conjugation** (as in this linked biphenyl-like structure) may stabilize the molecule, but the net effect depends on the balance of polar/nonpolar features.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has **3 Cl atoms and 2 OH groups**, placing it between the two chloro-phenol examples above. It is more substituted than **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.853) but less than **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (1.393). The ether linkage adds slight polarity but not as much as additional OH/Cl groups.  

Given the symmetry and additive effects of Cl/OH, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than **0.853** but below **1.393**.  

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.15** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with more polar substituents.)

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.1908454138057305
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`CC/C=C\C`  
This is **2-pentene** (specifically, *trans*-2-pentene due to the `\C` and `/C` notation indicating trans configuration). It is an alkene with a double bond and no significant polar functional groups.

**Similar examples from the dataset:**  
1. `CC/C=C/C` (property: **-0.19084541**) â This is *cis*-2-pentene (or another cis alkene). The trans isomer (our molecule) is typically slightly less polar due to symmetry, but the property value is likely close.  
2. `CCCC(=O)OC` (property: **0.53179669**) â This is an ester, much more polar due to the carbonyl and ether groups, so its value is higher.  
3. `CCCC(C)C` (property: **-0.18172332**) â This is a branched alkane (less polar than an alkene), and its value is slightly higher than the cis alkene.  

**Prediction:**  
The trans alkene (`CC/C=C\C`) should have a property value **slightly higher** than the cis alkene (`CC/C=C/C`) due to reduced polarity (but still in the same general range).  

Given the cis alkene is **-0.19084541**, I predict the trans alkene to be:  
**â -0.15 to -0.10**  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: -0.12**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that trans alkenes are typically less polar than cis alkenes and thus would have a slightly higher value in this context.)  

---  
**Final answer:**  
**-0.12** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the given examples).  

If more context about the property were available (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), the prediction could be refined further.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.729391178214291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - **CCOC** (dimethyl ether) is not explicitly in the examples, but similar ethers or oxygen-containing molecules can guide us.
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol) has a value of **0.53927351**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a value of **-0.05666276**, but this is an ester, not a simple ether.
   - Ethers without additional polar or aromatic groups tend to have lower (more negative) values, similar to hydrocarbons.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - **CC#C** (propyne) has a value of **-0.47004028**.
   - **CCC#C** (butyne) has a value of **-0.5507069** (longer chain = more negative).
   - **CCCCCC=C** (heptene) has a value of **-0.20248357**.
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) has a value of **-1.29474254** (cyclic hydrocarbons are more negative).
   - Linear alkanes/ethers with no other functional groups tend to have moderately negative values.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of **-0.75847805**.
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a value of **0.62206218**, but this is an ester.
   - Simple ethers like **CCCOCC** are less polar than alcohols, so their values are likely less negative than alcohols but more negative than pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCOCC** is a linear ether with no aromaticity or additional functional groups. It is most similar to **CCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCC** (a diester), which has a value of **-0.01981851**, but this is not a direct comparison.
   - The closest analog is likely **CCCCCC=C** (heptene, **-0.20248357**), as both are linear chains with moderate polarity.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCOCC** is a simple ether with a linear structure, its property value is expected to be moderately negative, similar to linear hydrocarbons or slightly less negative due to the oxygen atom. From the examples, the range for such molecules is between **-0.2 to -0.8**. 

A reasonable estimate is **-0.4**, as it is less polar than alcohols (which are around **-0.7**) but more polar than pure hydrocarbons (which are around **-0.2 to -0.5**).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-0.4**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or solubility, this value would align with expectations for a simple ether.)

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.155886938814363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)C`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - Two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`) attached to the amide nitrogen, contributing hydrophobicity and aromaticity.
   - A **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)c1ccccc1`) attached to the amide nitrogen, adding steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a property value of **-2.03347629**. This molecule also has a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and an additional heterocyclic group (thiazole). The presence of the polar thiazole and ester-like linkage (`COc`) likely makes it more polar than our target molecule.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** has a property value of **-2.02669266**. This is a rigid, hydrophobic structure with a tertiary amide and aliphatic rings, similar in bulkiness but more constrained than our target molecule.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a simple diphenylmethane derivative) has a property value of **-1.45477369**, indicating that two phenyl rings alone contribute significantly to hydrophobicity.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - Our target molecule has a **tert-butyl-like group** and a **tertiary amide**, which are more polar than pure hydrocarbons but less polar than molecules with additional heteroatoms or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., `-OH`, `-NO2`).
   - The absence of strongly polar groups (like `-OH`, `-NO2`, or `-CN`) suggests the property value will be less positive than molecules like `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (0.538) or `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O` (1.339).

4. **Estimated Property Value**:
   - The molecule is more hydrophobic than the amide-thiazole example (-2.033) but less hydrophobic than pure hydrocarbons (e.g., diphenylmethane at -1.454). The tert-butyl group adds bulk but not much polarity, so the value should be between these two.
   - A reasonable estimate is **-1.7 to -1.8**, closer to the rigid amide example (-2.026) but slightly less negative due to the flexibility and lack of additional polar groups.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.75** (specific value within the estimated range). 

This aligns with the trend observed for bulky, moderately polar amides with aromatic rings in the dataset.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.025623790100389492
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) attached. This is similar to aniline derivatives but with an acetylated nitrogen (amide) and a bromine substituent.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Amide (**CC(=O)N-**) is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - Bromine (**Br**) is a heavy halogen, contributing to lipophilicity and polarizability.
   - The benzene ring provides aromaticity and some hydrophobicity.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: 0.54546625): Phenol with an aldehyde group. The amide in our molecule is less polar than an aldehyde but more polar than a simple alkyl group.
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: 0.58856456): Phenol with bromine. Our molecule replaces the hydroxyl with an amide, which is less polar than a phenol but still polar.
- **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (property: 0.58856456): Methyl-substituted aniline. Our molecule has an amide instead of a free amine, reducing basicity/polarity but adding dipole moment.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property: 0.67449076): Dichlorobenzene. Halogenated aromatics tend to have moderate positive values.
- **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.51456361): Tertiary amide with bulky aromatic groups. Our molecule is simpler, so the value should be less negative.

### Key Observations:
- Amides in the examples tend to reduce the property value (e.g., tertiary amide at -0.514, secondary amides in other contexts are more negative).
- Bromine increases the value (as seen in **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** vs. non-halogenated analogs).
- The balance between the amide (reducing) and bromine (increasing) suggests a value between 0.2 and 0.6.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is:  
**0.42** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar structures).  

This reflects the competing effects of the polar amide (slightly reducing the property) and the bromine (increasing it), with the aromatic ring providing a moderate baseline.  

---  
**Final Answer:** The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **0.42**.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.25761845417828616
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): **0.78321946**
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not explicitly given, but similar to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **0.30173212**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **0.30173212**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): **0.3249352**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): **0.50985441**
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetonitrile): **0.62075179**
   - **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene): **0.56767417**

   Aromatic rings with small alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) tend to have property values in the range of **0.3 to 0.8**, with electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl) increasing the value compared to unsubstituted benzene (not given, but inferred).

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **-0.34837922**
   - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutanol-like): **-0.18172332**
   - Branching in the alkyl chain tends to slightly lower the property value compared to linear chains, but the effect is less pronounced when the alkyl group is attached to an aromatic ring.

3. **Isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1)**:
   - This is an aromatic ring with an isobutyl group (branched 4-carbon chain). 
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **0.30173212**
     - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): **0.3249352**
   - The isobutyl group is larger than ethyl or isopropyl but still electron-donating. Branching may slightly reduce the value compared to a linear chain.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely slightly lower than **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene, **0.3249352**) but higher than **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene, **0.30173212**). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.31** (approximate, likely in the range **0.30 to 0.32**). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the jump from ethyl (**0.3017**) to isopropyl (**0.3249**), the isobutyl group might add a smaller increment due to branching. Thus:  
**Final predicted value: 0.31** (closer to ethyltoluene but slightly higher). 

If forced to pick a specific number from the given examples' granularity: **0.310**. 

However, since the examples have more precision, I'll align with the trend and predict:  
**Predicted property value: 0.312**. 

But given the variability, **0.31** is a safe rounded estimate. 

### Exact Prediction:
After closer inspection, the value likely lies between **0.30** and **0.32**, so I'll predict:  
**0.31**. 

For consistency with the examples' precision, I'll select:  
**0.310**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is:  
**0.310**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is based on interpolation of the given data. The true value could vary slightly, but **0.31** is a reasonable estimate.) 

**Final answer: 0.310**

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.5098544082515718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I'll analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): 0.81758609  
     *(Polar groups like amide and hydroxyl increase the value.)*
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): 0.20769868  
     *(Less polar than phenol/amide, lower value.)*
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polyaromatic hydrocarbon): -0.93515855  
     *(No polar groups, highly negative value.)*

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (cyclic ketone): -0.04661457  
     *(Aliphatic ketone has a near-zero value.)*
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 1.03453522  
     *(Strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups increase the value.)*
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): -0.93516629  
     *(Two carbonyls in a cyclic imide, but bulky aromatic groups may lower the value.)*

3. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** has a single aromatic aldehyde group.  
     - The aldehyde (**CHO**) is polar and electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro or amide groups.  
     - Comparable to **COc1ccccc1** (0.207) but slightly more polar due to C=O.  
     - Less polar than **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.817), which has both amide and hydroxyl.

### Prediction:
The property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is likely **between 0.3 and 0.6**, reflecting its moderate polarity from the aldehyde group. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 0.45**  

*(This aligns with trends: higher than methoxybenzene (0.207) but lower than amide/phenol (0.817).)*  

### Final Answer:
**0.45**

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.2403394459862827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), one of which is part of a cyclic urea-like structure (diketopiperazine or hydantoin-like).
   - A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) attached to an aromatic ring.
   - An aromatic ether (**O** linked to an aromatic ring).
   - A conjugated system with alternating single and double bonds (aromatic ring + imine **N=C**).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which will polarize the aromatic ring and adjacent groups.
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors).
   - The imine (**N=C**) adds some rigidity and conjugation.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.983).
   - Molecules with multiple polar/amide groups (e.g., **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) also tend to have negative values (e.g., -1.156).
   - However, aromatic nitro groups combined with heterocycles (e.g., **c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2**) can have slightly positive values (e.g., 0.441), but this depends on the overall balance of polar/nonpolar groups.

4. **Unique Features**:
   - The cyclic urea/amide structure (two amides in a ring) is not directly represented in the examples, but similar polar groups (e.g., **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**) have slightly negative values (-0.092).
   - The imine linkage (**N=C**) is somewhat analogous to the **N=C** in **c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2**, which has a positive value (0.441), but the nitro group here may counteract that.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group and the two polar amide groups, the molecule is likely to have a **moderately negative property value**. The closest analogs in the examples suggest a range between **-0.5 and -1.0**. 

Considering the cyclic urea/amide structure and the nitro group, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

This balances the polar effects of the amides/nitro group with the slight positive contribution from the conjugated imine.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75**

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1.4547736866992345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) often have property values in the range of **0.5 to -1.5**, depending on substituents and functional groups.
   - For example:
     - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a value of **0.56767417**.
     - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like) has a value of **-1.07106452**.

2. **Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - Nitrogen-containing aromatic systems (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1**) tend to have positive values (~0.5).
   - When nitrogen is part of a more complex or conjugated system (e.g., **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**), the value becomes more negative.

3. **Diphenylamine-like Structure**:
   - The target molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative, where a nitrogen bridges two phenyl rings.
   - Similar structures:
     - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like) has **-1.07106452**.
     - The absence of the double-bonded nitrogen (=N) in the target molecule suggests a less conjugated system, which might result in a less negative value.

4. **Comparison to Aniline**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has **0.56767417**.
   - Adding a second phenyl group (**N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) would reduce conjugation slightly compared to azobenzene but still introduce some electron delocalization, likely resulting in a value between aniline and azobenzene.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is expected to be slightly negative but less so than **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-1.071). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Simple aniline: ~0.57
- Diphenylamine-like (less conjugation than azobenzene): ~-0.75
- Azobenzene-like (more conjugation): ~-1.07.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.788531554424903
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring fused with a diketopiperazine-like core). 
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity.
3. **Rigidity**: The fused ring system introduces rigidity, which often correlates with lower property values (more negative) in the given examples (e.g., cyclic/rigid structures like **C1CCCCCC1** have negative values).
4. **Similar Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.61437414): This has a similar diketopiperazine-like core with additional alkyl groups, yielding a positive but modest value.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = -0.67567501): A simpler cyclic amide with a negative value.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -0.72062259): A cyclic urea/amide with substituents, also negative.

### Key Observations:
- Cyclic amides/ureas in the examples tend to have **negative values** unless balanced by hydrophobic/aliphatic substituents (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a positive value due to bulky alkyl groups).
- The target molecule lacks bulky hydrophobic groups but has a rigid fused ring system, likely pushing the property toward the **negative side**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** but with less hydrophobic contribution, the property should be **less positive** than 0.61437414. Comparing to simpler cyclic amides (e.g., **O=C1CCCN1** at -0.67567501), the fused rings here may further decrease the value. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -1.0**. Averaging similar cases, I predict:  
**-0.72** (close to **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** at -0.72062259).

**-0.72**

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.263690645756618
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Symmetry and Substitution**: The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with three chlorine atoms (two on one ring, one on the other). It is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property: **-0.47273448**), which also has multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings.
2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**: The chlorine atoms are electron-withdrawing, which would influence the property similarly to other chlorinated aromatics in the dataset (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl** with property **0.78321946**). However, the biphenyl core and additional chlorines may reduce the property value due to increased steric and electronic effects.
3. **Comparison to Biphenyl-like Structures**: The molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property of **-1.16792032**, suggesting that extended aromatic systems with no polar groups tend to have lower (more negative) values. However, the chlorines here add polarity, likely raising the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Key Observations:
- The closest analog is **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (**-0.47273448**), which has more chlorines but a similar biphenyl core. The given molecule has fewer chlorines, so its property value might be slightly higher (less negative).
- Chlorinated aromatics like **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (**0.78321946**) have positive values, but the biphenyl linkage and additional chlorines here likely reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the biphenyl core (tending to lower the value) and the chlorines (tending to raise it), the property value should be slightly negative but closer to zero than **-0.47273448**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This aligns with the trend observed in the dataset for similarly substituted biphenyl systems.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.14148457671525685
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, 1,4-diethylbenzene based on the symmetry of the structure).

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with alkyl substituents** tend to have property values in the range of **-1.0 to +1.0**, depending on the nature and length of the alkyl chain.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1N` (methylaniline) has a value of **0.783**.
   - Example: `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (hexylbenzene) has a value of **-1.074**.
   - Example: `CCc1ccccn1` (ethylpyridine) has a value of **0.208**.

2. **Symmetry and substitution pattern**: The molecule is symmetric (para-substituted diethylbenzene), which may slightly lower the property value compared to monosubstituted or ortho/meta-disubstituted aromatics.

3. **Lack of polar functional groups**: Since there are no polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO), the value will likely be closer to neutral but slightly positive due to the weakly electron-donating ethyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (specific value: 0.25000000). 

This reflects its neutral aromatic character with weak alkyl substitution effects, similar to other alkylbenzenes in the dataset.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9099172343375195
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, which is a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2). 
2. **Substituent**: The aniline is substituted with a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)** at the para position relative to the amino group. This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group due to the sulfonyl (=O) bonds.
3. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**: The sulfonamide group is highly polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding (both as a donor and acceptor), which typically increases solubility or related properties. The amino group is electron-donating, while the sulfonamide is electron-withdrawing, creating a push-pull effect.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline) has a property value of **0.53333665**. Here, the nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to the sulfonamide group but without the hydrogen-bonding capability of the sulfonamide's NH.
- **Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O** (a complex heterocycle with multiple H-bonding groups) has a value of **-1.30658751**, but this is less relevant due to the vastly different structure.
- **Oc1ccncc1** (hydroxypyridine) has a value of **0.56767417**, which is somewhat comparable due to the aromatic ring with a polar substituent (OH).
- **Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1** (methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **1.11713836**, reflecting the impact of polar OH and aromaticity.

### Key Observations:
1. The sulfonamide group is more polar and H-bonding-capable than a nitro group, so we might expect a higher value than nitroaniline (0.53333665).
2. However, it is less polar than a phenol with multiple methyl groups (1.11713836), as the sulfonamide's electron-withdrawing nature may counteract some of the polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the electron-donating amino group and the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide, along with the additional H-bonding capability, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than nitroaniline but lower than the methylated phenol. 

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâe.g., logP, solubility, etc.âthis is a qualitative estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

True Property: -0.7789945811263388
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's more complex). The structure can be broken down as:
- A central naphthalene-like core (two fused rings) with additional fused rings extending out.

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**, property = 0.20769868) tend to have modest positive values.
   - Larger fused aromatic systems (e.g., **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**, property = -0.69963878) tend to have negative values, likely due to increased conjugation and rigidity.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro groups) often increase the property value (e.g., **c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1**, property = 0.85320088).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxy) can also increase the value (e.g., **Cc1ccc(O)cc1**, property = 0.58856456).

3. **Fused Polycyclic Systems**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property = -0.69963878): A complex fused system with 4 rings, similar to the target molecule.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property = -1.1447625): A larger fused system with 5 rings, showing more negative values as size increases.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** (property = -1.1447625): Another 4-ring system, identical in structure to the target molecule, with a value of -1.1447625.

### Prediction:
The target molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is **identical in structure** to one of the examples provided (**c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, property = -1.1447625). Thus, the predicted property value is:

**-1.1447625**  

### Reasoning:
- The molecule is a fully conjugated, planar, and rigid polycyclic aromatic system with no substituents. Such systems typically exhibit negative property values in the given dataset, likely due to electronic or steric effects captured by the property.
- The value aligns with other fused aromatic systems of similar size in the examples.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -1.3474776663871986
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity (e.g., size, branching, functional groups). 

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**  

### Key features of the molecule:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: The molecule has four -OH groups, which are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. This typically lowers the property value (as seen in similar molecules like `Oc1cccc(O)c1` with a value of 0.674 and `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` with -0.851).
2. **Aromatic rings**: There are two aromatic rings, one of which is fused with a lactone-like structure (C(=O)CC). Aromaticity alone doesn't seem to dominate the property (e.g., `c1cc2ccc(OC)c(CC=C(C)(C))c2oc1=O` has a value of -0.094), but combined with polar groups, it tends to reduce the value.
3. **Lactone/carbonyl group (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl in a cyclic structure adds polarity but is less impactful than -OH (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` has -0.321).
4. **No halogens or large hydrophobic groups**: The absence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) or long aliphatic chains (which often increase the value, e.g., `CCCCC(C)(O)CC` has 1.154) suggests the value will not be strongly positive.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` (-0.851): Similar polarity but with halogens; our molecule lacks halogens but has more -OH groups.
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (0.674): Simpler but with two -OH groups; our molecule has more -OH and additional complexity.
- `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (-1.316): Structurally similar (fused rings, -OH, C=O), and our molecule is even more polar.

### Prediction:
The molecule is highly polar due to multiple -OH groups and a carbonyl, with no hydrophobic or halogenated regions to offset this. Based on the trend, such molecules tend to have **negative property values**, especially when compared to similar examples like `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (-1.316).  

Given the additional -OH groups and lack of halogens, the value should be slightly more negative than -1.316 but not as extreme as very large or halogenated molecules (e.g., -2.0).  

### Final predicted value:  
**-1.45** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the data).

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 2.5685746920991814
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)** often lead to **moderate positive values** (e.g., 0.648, 0.897, 3.266). The highest value (3.266) is for a complex phosphorus ester with multiple electronegative groups (Cl, O).
2. **Amide groups (NC=O)** tend to have **neutral to slightly positive values** (e.g., 0.025, 0.491).
3. **Thioether (S-C) or thiol (S-H) groups** often contribute **positive values** (e.g., 1.054 for Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1).
4. **Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC)** have **negative values** (e.g., -1.011).
5. **Combination of P=O, amide, and S-C** in a single molecule is not directly present in the examples, but similar fragments suggest additive or synergistic effects.

### Analysis of **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**:
- The molecule contains:
  - A **phosphate group (P=O)** with an amide linkage (NC(C)=O) and a thioether (S-C).
  - The **P=O** and **S-C** fragments are likely to contribute **positive values**.
  - The **amide (NC=O)** may slightly reduce the effect (but not drastically).

### Closest Matches in Examples:
1. **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** â **0.648** (P=S, Cl substituents).
2. **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** â **0.897** (P=O, Cl substituents).
3. **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** â **-0.421** (P=S, but with long aliphatic chains reducing the value).

Given that **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A **P=O** (stronger than P=S in terms of polarity),
- An **amide** (neutralizing some effect),
- A **thioether (S-C)** (positive contribution),
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) to push the value higher,

the value is likely **between 0.6 and 1.0**, closer to the phosphate examples but slightly lower due to the amide.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.75** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar fragments). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the absence of exact matches in the training data.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.3300278387899034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of **0.05889441**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a value of **0.85320088**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a value of **0.58856456**.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroacetanilide) has a value of **0.02562379**.
   - **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** has a value of **-1.26816012**.

   Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive or near-zero values, but the presence of other functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, amine) can significantly affect the property.

2. **Alkenes and Simple Halogenated Alkenes**:
   - **CCC=O** (butyraldehyde) has a value of **-0.80971405**.
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (a branched alkene) has the same value as **CCCC(=O)C** (0.20612343), suggesting that the presence of a double bond (C=C or C=O) can lead to similar property values.
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a simple halogenated alkene with no additional functional groups.

3. **Trend for Dichloroethene**:
   - The molecule is small and symmetric with two chlorine atoms on a double bond. Compared to other halogenated compounds, it lacks aromaticity or additional functional groups.
   - Given that **CCC=O** (a simple unsaturated compound) has a negative value (-0.80971405) and **CCCC(=C)C** has a positive value (0.20612343), the property for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is likely intermediate.
   - The presence of electronegative chlorines may slightly increase the value compared to non-halogenated alkenes, but the lack of aromaticity or complex structure suggests it won't be as high as chlorinated aromatics.

### Predicted Property:
Considering the above, the property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15** (specific value: 0.15000000). 

This reflects its simple halogenated alkene nature, intermediate between non-halogenated alkenes and more complex halogenated aromatics.

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.526872574036889
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Contains a pyridine-like nitrogen in a complex aromatic system, property = -1.356.
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: Contains multiple nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings, property = -0.214.
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**: Contains nitrogen in aromatic rings, property = +0.362.
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: Contains nitrogen in aromatic rings, property = -0.093.

   Pyridine-like nitrogens (as in **c1ccncc1**) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.2 to +0.4**, depending on substitution and conjugation.

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: Aniline derivative, property = +0.208.
   - **CCNc1ccccc1**: Similar to aniline but with ethyl substitution, property = -0.205.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: Polyaromatic hydrocarbon, property = -0.748.

   Simple aromatic systems without heteroatoms tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative.

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. From the examples, similar nitrogen-containing aromatics (e.g., **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**) have property values around **-0.2 to +0.4**.
   - Since pyridine is less conjugated than some of the more complex examples and lacks additional functional groups, its property value is likely closer to zero but slightly negative due to the electronegative nitrogen.

### Predicted Property for **c1ccncc1**:
Given the trends, the most reasonable prediction for pyridine is a property value of **-0.15**. This aligns with:
- The slight negative influence of the nitrogen atom.
- The lack of additional functional groups or conjugation that would push the value further negative or positive.

### Final Answer:
**-0.15**

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -1.5955022791900173
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Ether (OCC(O)CO-)**: Ethers like **CCOC=C** have a value of **-0.61035657**, but this is part of a larger polar group here.
   - **Ester (COC(=O)-)**: Esters like **CCOC(=O)CC** have values around **0.5052007**.
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents (c1ccccc1N-)**: Aromatic rings with polar groups (e.g., **N**) tend to have values in the range of **-0.3 to 0.5** (e.g., **c1ccc2cnccc2c1** is **0.31407929**).
   - **Chlorinated aromatic (cc(Cl)ccc)**: Chlorinated aromatics like **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** have values around **0.58856456**.
   - **Heterocyclic nitrogen (ccnc)**: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine-like) often have values near **0.1 to 0.3** (e.g., **c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2** is **0.14261584**).
   - **Hydroxy groups (OCC(O)-)**: Polyols like **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** have very high values (**2.3994887**), but this molecule only has two hydroxy groups.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is large and polar due to multiple functional groups (ester, hydroxy, aromatic N, Cl). This suggests a balance between positive (polar) and negative (size/heterocycle) contributions.

3. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2** (similar ester + aromatic + ether) has **-1.0133635**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** (diester + aromatic) has **0.5221487**.
   - The presence of **Cl** and **N** in the aromatic system may push the value toward the middle of the range.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of polar groups (increasing the value) and the larger size/heterocycle (decreasing the value), I estimate the property to be **slightly negative but closer to zero** than some of the more extreme examples. A reasonable guess is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.25**  

This balances the ester's positive contribution (~0.5), the aromatic N/Cl (~0.2), and the size/heterocycle's negative impact (~-0.5). The exact value would depend on finer electronic effects, but this is a plausible estimate based on the given data.
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.729391178214291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: 
   - Larger aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, property = -0.205) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Smaller alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O**, property = 1.266) have positive values, likely due to polarity/hydrogen bonding.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: 
     - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a property of -1.137, suggesting that aliphatic alcohols with larger rings are more negative.
     - **CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol) has a high positive value (1.266), likely due to steric effects and reduced hydrogen bonding.
   - **Ethers (e.g., COC=O)**: Negative values (-0.810), but less negative than alcohols with similar size.

3. **Chain Length**:
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane) has a property of -0.366, while **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane) is -0.348. Longer chains are slightly more negative.
   - **CCCCCO** is a 5-carbon alcohol, similar in length to **CCCCCCCI** but with an -OH group instead of iodine.

4. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) is -0.610, while **COC=O** (methyl formate) is -0.810. Longer chains reduce the negativity slightly.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)...** (complex ester) is -2.013, but this is likely due to the large, rigid structure.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- It is a medium-chain aliphatic alcohol (similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** but linear and shorter).
- The hydroxyl group will contribute some polarity, but the aliphatic chain (5 carbons) will dominate, pushing the value toward the moderately negative range.
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-1.137), **CCCCCO** is linear and smaller, so the value should be less negative (closer to zero).
- Compared to **CCCc1ccccc1** (-0.205), the -OH group adds polarity but not enough to make it positive.

### Estimated Property:
Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCO** is:  
**-0.75** (between -0.205 and -1.137, closer to -0.5 to -0.8 based on chain length and -OH influence).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at similar molecules:
- **OC1CCCCCCC1**: -1.137 (cyclic, 7 carbons + OH)
- **CCCCCCCI**: -0.366 (6 carbons + I)
- **CCC(C)Cl**: -0.348 (4 carbons + Cl)

For **CCCCCO** (5 carbons + OH), the value should be between -0.366 and -1.137. A good compromise is:  
**-0.65** (accounting for the OH's polarity offsetting the aliphatic chain).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is:  
**-0.65** (approximate, based on structural trends).

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.8313852443932119
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))** attached to a **cyclic ether (CCO1)** and a **substituted benzene ring (Nc2ccccc2)**. The presence of a **carbonyl group (C=O)** attached to the nitrogen (amide-like) and a **thiophene-like ring (CC1=C...S...)** suggests moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - Amide (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - Aromatic ring (moderate hydrophobicity).
   - Cyclic ether (moderate polarity).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **sulfonyl groups** (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**) have values around **0.164**.
   - Molecules with **amides + aromatics** (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**) have values around **0.026**.
   - Molecules with **cyclic ethers + polar groups** (e.g., **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**) have values around **-0.393**.
   - The **sulfonyl + amide + aromatic** combination suggests a balance between polarity and hydrophobicity.

4. **Hybrid Features**:
   - The sulfonyl group is more polarizing than a simple ether but less than a nitro group.
   - The amide adds polarity but is offset by the aromatic ring.
   - The cyclic ether is less polar than a free hydroxyl group.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (sulfonyl, amide) and moderately hydrophobic (aromatic, cyclic ether) features, the property value is likely in the **range of 0.1 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.215**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset while accounting for the specific functional group interplay.

Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.1533434330007103
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is present in the fragment `c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`. From the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has 0.53333665, `CC(C)N(=O)=O` has 1.01649641).
2. **Ester groups (C(=O)OC)**: The molecule has two ester groups. Esters can contribute to polarity and may slightly increase the property value (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC` has 0.5052007).
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (NC=)**: The presence of a nitrogen in a ring can influence the property. For example, `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` has 0.44068919, while `c2ccc1NCCc1c2` has -0.3566366. Here, the nitrogen is part of a more complex system, so its effect is harder to isolate.
4. **Substituted aromatic systems**: The molecule has a substituted benzene ring, which is common in many examples. The exact effect depends on the substituents, but nitro and ester groups are present here.
5. **Branched/alkyl groups**: The molecule has methyl groups (`C(C)`), which are common in many examples with positive values (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has 0.23839346).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The nitro group and ester groups suggest a positive contribution.
- The heterocyclic nitrogen might slightly reduce the value, but the overall effect is likely dominated by the nitro and ester groups.
- The molecule is more complex than most examples, but structurally similar to `CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC` (property 2.50711281), which has multiple polar groups (though not identical).

### Predicted property:
Given the strong positive contributions from the nitro and ester groups, and the lack of strongly negative features (e.g., long aliphatic chains or polycyclic systems), the property value is likely in the **positive range, around 1.0 to 1.5**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**1.24000000** (rounded to 8 decimal places as in the examples). 

This is based on the combined effects of the nitro group (similar to `CC(C)N(=O)=O` at 1.016) and the ester groups (similar to `CCCCC(=O)OC` at 0.505), with some adjustment for the heterocyclic nitrogen.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.8128969105227446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests some polarity, but the rigid cyclopropane ring may counteract this effect.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Amides**: Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23`, property = -0.776) tend to have negative property values, likely due to hydrogen bonding and polarity.
   - **Rigid Rings**: Cyclopropane introduces strain and rigidity, which may reduce flexibility and interaction potential (e.g., `C1CCCCC1`, property = -1.374 for cyclohexane, but cyclopropane is more strained).
   - **No Aromaticity**: Unlike many examples with aromatic rings (which often have values around 0 to -1), this molecule lacks aromaticity, which could push the value further negative.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog might be `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (property = -0.714), which has two amide-like groups and some rigidity. However, our molecule lacks aromaticity and chlorine substituents, so its value might be slightly less negative.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of two amide groups (polar, negative contribution) and a strained cyclopropane ring (reducing flexibility and interactions), the property value is likely **negative and moderately sized**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.85**  

This balances the polar amides' effects with the rigidity of the small ring, placing it between the more negative aromatic amides and the less negative flexible aliphatics.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -2.0715555858337034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -1.0116293  
     A simple alkane with no functional groups has a moderately negative value.
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane, 2,2-dimethylbutane): 1.21199338  
     Branching seems to increase the property value significantly compared to linear alkanes.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): 0.56767417  
     Aromatic ring with a single chlorine substituent has a positive value.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorobenzene): 1.17724393  
     Multiple chlorines on an aromatic ring increase the property value further.
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.47004028  
     A nitrile group reduces the property value compared to simple alkanes.

2. **Chlorinated Small Alkanes**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is a simple chlorinated alkane. From the examples, halogenation (especially chlorine) tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated alkanes (e.g., pentane is -1.0116293, while chlorobenzene is 0.56767417). However, the effect is less pronounced for small aliphatic chlorinated compounds.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile) is a small polar molecule with a nitrile group and has a value of -0.47004028. Chloroethane is also small and polar but with a less electron-withdrawing group (Cl vs. CN), so its value might be slightly higher.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of 0.56767417, but chloroethane lacks the aromatic ring, so its value should be lower.

### Prediction for ClCC:
Given that:
- Simple alkanes (e.g., pentane) have values around -1.0.
- Chlorination increases the value (e.g., chlorobenzene is ~0.57).
- Small chlorinated aliphatics (like chloroethane) likely have values between these extremes.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCC** is **~0.1 to 0.3**. Considering the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCC: 0.25**  

This is based on the balance between the small size of the molecule (reducing the value compared to larger chlorinated aromatics) and the presence of chlorine (increasing the value compared to pure alkanes).

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.640734655439768
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -1.226). 
   - However, **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a highly positive value (1.824), likely due to the nitro group (N(=O)=O), which seems to override the chlorine effect.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Chlorine**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = -0.3446 (moderately negative).
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: Property = -0.3549 (similar to above).
   - These suggest that chlorinated aromatics without strongly polar groups tend to have slightly negative values.

3. **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (Trichloromethyl Group)**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: Property = -1.068.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Property = -0.4727.
   - The trichloromethyl group appears to contribute to negative property values, especially when combined with aromatic systems.

4. **Heterocycles with Chlorine**:
   - The target molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is a chlorinated pyridine (nitrogen-containing aromatic) with a trichloromethyl group. 
   - Pyridine itself (without substituents) is not in the examples, but nitrogen in aromatic systems (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**) can lead to positive values (0.4407). However, the trichloromethyl group and additional chlorines likely dominate here.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has:
- A chlorinated pyridine ring (similar to chlorinated benzenes, which tend toward slightly negative values).
- A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group, which strongly pushes the property negative (as seen in other examples).

Given the combination of these features, the property value is likely **more negative** than simple chlorinated aromatics but less extreme than highly chlorinated aliphatics (e.g., -0.5 to -1.0 range). 

Comparing to similar structures:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: -0.4727 (two aromatic rings + C(Cl)(Cl)Cl).
- **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: -1.068 (more complex, but with C(Cl)(Cl)Cl).

The target molecule has one aromatic ring + C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, so the value should be between these two. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (approximately midway between -0.47 and -1.07, accounting for the pyridine nitrogen's slight mitigating effect). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.08470018262600972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = **0.37407101**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property = **0.23839346**
   - **CCC(C)CCO**: Property = **0.20719331**
   - **CCC(CC)CO**: Property = **0.51224177**

   Alcohols generally have positive property values, and the value seems to increase slightly with branching (e.g., **CCC(CC)CO** has a higher value than **CCC(C)CCO**).

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to decrease the property value slightly (e.g., **CCCCCCCCl** = **-0.36639592** vs. **ClCC** = **-2.07155559**).
   - Branching in alcohols seems to increase the property value (e.g., **CCC(CC)CO** = **0.51224177** vs. **CCC(C)CCO** = **0.20719331**).

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group on a secondary carbon (similar to **CCC(CC)CO**, which is a 6-carbon branched alcohol with a value of **0.51224177**).
   - Shorter branched alcohols like **CCC(C)CCO** have a value of **0.20719331**.

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O**:
- It is a 5-carbon branched alcohol, structurally similar to **CCC(CC)CO** but with one fewer carbon in the main chain.
- The property value is likely slightly lower than **CCC(CC)CO** (0.51224177) but higher than **CCC(C)CCO** (0.20719331).
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.35**, considering the trends.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is **0.35**.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.5885645612506096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property value = **-0.42685231**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4-chlorobiphenyl with another Cl): Property value = **-0.42685231**
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): Not explicitly given, but similar structures with single halogen substitutions tend to have negative values (e.g., **ClCCl** = -2.07155559, but this is aliphatic).

   The presence of halogens (Cl/Br) on aromatic rings generally leads to negative property values, with the magnitude depending on the number and position of halogens.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs (less negative).
   - For example, **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform) = -0.75847805, while **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride) = 0.51451203. This suggests that increasing halogen substitution can sometimes increase the property value.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted aromatics (para-substitution) like **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** have a property value of **-0.42685231**.
   - The given molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is the brominated analog of this structure.

### Prediction:
- The brominated analog (**Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**) is expected to have a property value slightly less negative than the chlorinated version due to bromine's larger size and polarizability. 
- Adjusting for the trend seen in other halogenated aromatics, I estimate the property value to be **approximately -0.35 to -0.40**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the closest analog (**Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -0.42685231) and accounting for bromine's effects, the predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is:

**-0.38** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

This is a reasonable interpolation based on the data.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.10139052188669313
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them with the provided examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl derivative** with chlorine atoms substituted on both aromatic rings. 
2. It resembles the second example in the provided list:  
   **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which has a property value of **0.57803127**.  
   However, the given molecule has fewer chlorine substitutions (some positions are unsubstituted or have fewer Cl atoms).

3. The presence of multiple **chlorine atoms** and **aromatic rings** tends to contribute to a **moderate positive or near-zero property value** in the examples (e.g., 0.578, 0.205, 0.817 for nitro/chloro aromatics).

4. The molecule is **less chlorinated** than the second example but more chlorinated than simple aromatic systems like **c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = 0.817). 

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the second example but with slightly fewer chlorines, the property value should be **slightly lower** than 0.57803127 but still **positive**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolation from the given examples. If more context were available, the prediction could be refined further.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -1.518457730978069
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -NO2, -CN, -NH2) tend to have more negative or positive property values, depending on their electronegativity and hydrogen bonding potential.
   - Example: **CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C** (highly polar, value = 2.41287253).
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Aromaticity alone doesn't strongly dictate the property, but substitution patterns (e.g., halogens, polar groups) influence it.
   - Example: **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (non-polar substituents, value = 0.78321946).
3. **Phosphorus/Sulfur Groups**: Phosphates (P=O, P=S) and sulfur-containing groups can lead to more extreme values (either highly negative or positive).
   - Example: **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** (value = 2.00342105).
4. **Size and Branching**: Larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have more negative values.
   - Example: **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** (value = -2.06381669).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**
- **Structure**: Contains a central phosphate group (**OP(=O)(OR)OR**) linked to two aromatic rings (one with a methyl substituent and one with a methyl and phenyl substituent).
- **Polarity**: The phosphate group is highly polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
- **Aromaticity**: Two substituted aromatic rings (moderate influence).
- **Size**: Relatively large and complex, similar to some of the more negative examples.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** (value = 2.00342105) and **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (value = -0.86333847), but with a phosphate (P=O) instead of phosphorothioate (P=S).
- The presence of the **P=O** group and aromatic rings suggests a moderately negative value, but not as extreme as some of the highly polar or large cyclic examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1** is:

**-1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples). 

This balances the polar phosphate group with the aromatic contributions and size of the molecule.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.7898603973850887
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the aromatic ring. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`) tend to have moderate positive values (~0.128 to ~0.967). The CF3 group is electronegative but not strongly polarizing in this context.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The aromatic ring has a CF3 and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached. Similar structures (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` and `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have values around **0.533**.
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle**: The `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` moiety introduces two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Chlorines are electronegative but often balance out in larger structures (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **0.271**). The ketone (C=O) is polar but not strongly destabilizing.
4. **Overall polarity**: The molecule is polar due to CF3, Cl, and C=O, but the aromaticity and balanced substituents suggest a moderate value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`: **0.533** (similar nitro/amino-aromatic)
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`: **0.659** (chloro + nitro)
- `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`: **0.128** (complex heterocycle with Cl/SO2)

The presence of CF3 (slightly more electron-withdrawing than NO2) and the chlorinated heterocycle (similar to other chloro-aromatics) suggests a value between **0.4 and 0.7**.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the balance of electronegative groups and aromatic stability, the most plausible estimate is:  
**0.56** (similar to `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` at **0.561**).

### Final Answer:
**0.56** (rounded to two decimal places).

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7572881673792355
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a **methoxy-substituted benzene ring** with a **nitro group (N(=O)=O)**. 
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.
   - The methoxy group (OCHâ) is electron-donating and moderately polar.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of **0.53856227**. This is a highly polar molecule with two nitro groups.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **0.56767417**, reflecting moderate polarity due to the hydroxyl group.
   - **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a chlorinated pyridine) has a value of **0.64073466**, showing that halogenation increases the property.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) is less polar than phenol but still has a significant value (0.53856227).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to increase the property value (e.g., dinitrobenzene at 0.53856227).
   - Methoxy groups are less polar than hydroxyl groups but still contribute positively (compare phenol at 0.56767417 to anisole, which would likely be slightly lower).
   - The combination of methoxy and nitro groups suggests a balance between electron donation (methoxy) and withdrawal (nitro), leading to moderate polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitroanisole) should have a property value **slightly lower than phenol but higher than dinitrobenzene**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.52**  

This reflects the competing effects of the electron-donating methoxy group and the electron-withdrawing nitro group, resulting in a moderately polar molecule.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.8713974753367544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule contains **8 chlorine atoms**, making it heavily halogenated. This is similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane), which has a property value of **0.07115594**. However, the given molecule has even more chlorines and a more complex polycyclic structure.

2. **Polycyclic Framework**: The molecule has a bridged polycyclic structure (likely a chlorinated norbornane or similar), which introduces steric and electronic effects. Polycyclic structures in the examples (e.g., **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**) tend to have negative property values, but chlorination may counteract this.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: Chlorines are electron-withdrawing, which could increase the property value (as seen in **Clc1ccccc1** with a value of **0.56767417**). However, extreme chlorination may lead to steric hindrance or other effects.

4. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - **ClCCCl** (dichloroethane): **-1.42194855** (simple aliphatic chlorination).
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): **0.85320088** (aromatic chlorination with OH).
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**: **0.07115594** (aliphatic, highly chlorinated).

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and polycyclic nature, the property value is likely **positive but lower than aromatic chlorinated compounds**. The closest analog is **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**, but with more chlorines and rigidity, the value might be slightly higher. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (estimated based on balancing polycyclic effects and heavy chlorination). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted (e.g., solubility, reactivity, etc.) isn't specified, but the trend suggests a moderately positive value.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.4455776058356753
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Cycloalkanes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) has a low value (-1.29474254), indicating that saturated hydrocarbons tend to have negative values.
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne) has a value of -0.5507069, suggesting that unsaturation (alkynes) reduces the magnitude of the negative value compared to alkanes.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has a value of 0.05878292, showing that esters (RCOOR') with aromatic groups can have slightly positive values.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenethyl alcohol) has a value of 0.23839346, indicating that alcohols attached to aromatic rings increase the property value.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C(C)C** (a cyclic imide with unsaturated side chains) has a value of 0.53950838, showing that multiple carbonyl groups can increase the value.

3. **Formates (HCOOR)**:
   - No direct examples of formates are given, but esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester) have slightly positive values (~0.058). Formates are simpler esters, so their values may be similar or slightly lower.

4. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., C=O, OH) tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - Small esters like **CCCOC=O** are polar but lack aromaticity or additional functional groups, so their values are likely modest.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
- **CCCOC=O** is a small aliphatic ester (propyl formate). 
- It lacks aromaticity or additional functional groups, so its value should be slightly positive but lower than esters with aromatic rings (e.g., ethyl 4-aminobenzoate at 0.058).
- Comparing to **CCC#C** (-0.5507069, alkyne) and **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (0.23839346, aromatic alcohol), the ester group in **CCCOC=O** should place it between these values but closer to zero due to its simplicity.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**0.05** (slightly positive, similar to other small esters but without aromatic contributions). 

However, looking more closely at **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (0.058) and noting that **CCCOC=O** is simpler, I would adjust slightly downward.  

### Final Prediction:  
**0.03** (specific value based on interpolation of similar examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The actual value may vary slightly, but it should be in this range.)  

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is **0.03**.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.5550536589860438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with property **-1.0740025**) tend to have negative values. 
   - Shorter chains or polar groups reduce the negativity (e.g., **CCOc1ccccc1** with **-0.20513169**).

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(...)** with **1.09705413**) often increase the property value.
   - Alcohols (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** with **0.58856456**) also contribute positively but less than esters.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings alone (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** with **0.20164531**) tend to have small positive values unless heavily substituted with halogens or other groups.

4. **Halogens**:
   - Halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** with **1.06378252**) increase the property value significantly.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrophobic chain would typically push the property toward negative values (as seen in **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with **-1.0740025**).
- However, the ester group is polar and would counteract this effect, likely bringing the value closer to neutral or slightly positive.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2...** (a steroid-like structure with ketone) has **-2.01648902**, but this is more complex.
- **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde) has **1.6829077**, but the unsaturation and aldehyde group are more polarizing.
- **CCCOC** (simple ether) has **-1.0116293**, but this lacks the ester group.

Given the long chain and the ester, the property value is likely **between -0.5 and 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is closer to **0.0** because the ester's polarity balances the hydrophobicity of the chain.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.12345678**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trends; the actual value may vary slightly.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8531258443252334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**:
   - Phenol groups (e.g., `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` in the examples) tend to lower the property value (e.g., `0.20164531` for a simple phenol).
   - Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) further reduces the value (e.g., `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has `0.30173212`).

2. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**:
   - Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value slightly (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has `0.6597382`).
   - Multiple Cl substitutions (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`) reduce the value (`-0.7804366`).

3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**:
   - Amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1ccccc1`) have moderate values (`0.49162121`), but when combined with aromatic systems, they can lower the value.

4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Nitro groups (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) significantly increase the property value (`0.6597382`).

5. **Aromatic systems**:
   - The molecule has two aromatic rings with substitutions, which typically moderate the value unless polar groups dominate.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (nitro + Cl): `0.6597382`
- `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (phenol + Cl): `0.30173212`
- `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` (multiple Cl + phenol): `-0.7804366`
- `NC(=O)c1ccccc1` (amide): `0.49162121`

### Prediction:
The molecule combines:
- A phenol group (reducing effect).
- Two Cl substitutions (moderate reducing effect).
- A nitro group (strong increasing effect).
- An amide linker (moderate effect).

Given the competing effects:
- The nitro group will dominate, pushing the value higher.
- The phenol and Cl substitutions will partially offset this.

From similar examples, the nitro + Cl system (`Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) has `0.6597382`, while the phenol + Cl system (`COc1ccc(Cl)cc1`) has `0.30173212`. The amide linker may slightly reduce the value.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **`0.3 to 0.5`**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: `0.42`**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -1.3550273437183598
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC))**: These are present twice in the molecule. From the examples, molecules with P(=S) groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have property values around **0.22667713**. This suggests that P(=S) groups may contribute positively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic Rings and Thioether Linkage (Sc2ccc...)**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings linked by a thioether (S) bridge. Aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) tend to have positive values (~0.5), while thioethers (e.g., **CCSSCC**) have negative values (~-0.729). The combination may balance out somewhat.
3. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, with two identical phosphorothioate-aryl fragments. Larger molecules with multiple functional groups often have property values that average out the contributions of individual groups.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = **0.22667713** (phosphorothioate + aromatic + polar groups).
- **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.19901378** (large, halogenated aromatic).
- **CCSSCC**: Property = **-0.72939118** (thioether).

Given the presence of two phosphorothioate groups (positive contribution) and a thioether bridge (negative contribution), the property value is likely to be modestly positive but lower than single phosphorothioate examples due to the counteracting effects of the thioether and increased size.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.15**, balancing the positive contributions of the phosphorothioates and the negative influence of the thioether.

**Final Answer: 0.15**

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6597382009197083
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: The molecule is a nitrophenol derivative (phenol with a nitro group). 
   - Example: **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has a property value of **0.81758609** (amide + phenol).
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (toluene with nitro group) has a property value of **0.81758609**.
   - Example: **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** (aniline with chloro) has a value of **0.67449076**.

2. **Electron-withdrawing groups (NOâ)**: The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value compared to plain phenol or aniline, but the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group adds some polarity.

3. **Similar molecules**:
   - **Clc1cccc(Br)c1** (halogenated benzene) has a value of **0.67449076**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (more complex nitro+ether) has **-0.9830511**, but this is likely due to additional complexity.

4. **Phenol derivatives**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (chlorinated phenol) has **1.06378252**, but this is likely due to heavy halogenation.
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** (methylated phenol) has **0.84178131**.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a simple nitrophenol. Given that:
- Nitrobenzene-like structures (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) have values around **0.81758609**,
- Phenol derivatives with moderate substituents tend to have values in the **0.6â0.9** range,
- The nitro group is electron-withdrawing but the OH is electron-donating (leading to some cancellation),

A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than **0.81758609** but higher than **0.67449076** (plain halogenated benzene). 

### Final Prediction:
**0.75** (interpolated based on similar examples). 

However, looking closely, **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** (aniline with chloro) is **0.67449076**, and **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene) is **0.81758609**. Since nitrophenol is more polar than nitrotoluene but less than heavily substituted examples, a value close to **0.8** is plausible. 

Given the exact match for **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (0.81758609) and the similarity, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.81758609** (same as nitrotoluene, as the OH and NOâ effects may balance out similarly). 

But if we account for the OH group's additional polarity, a slight adjustment downward is reasonable (e.g., **0.78**). 

Given the data, the most consistent answer is:  
**0.81758609** (same as the nitrotoluene example, as no stronger trend overrides this). 

However, if forced to pick a distinct value, I'd say **0.80** (rounded from 0.817...). 

But based on the exact examples, the safest answer is:  
**0.81758609**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.81758609** (same as the nitrotoluene example, as the substituent effects appear comparable in the given data).

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -1.9636440466059613
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a highly oxygenated carbohydrate (a sugar derivative, likely a oligosaccharide or polysaccharide fragment) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) and ether (-O-) groups, which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, carbonyls) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `-0.39343403`).
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages in the given molecule suggests strong polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, which aligns with negative property values in the training data.

The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is even more polar and complex than the simpler sugar `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`, so its property value should be more negative. 

Comparing to similar structures in the examples (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` with `-2.06381669`), this molecule is less hydrophobic but has more polar interactions, so the value should be less negative than that but more negative than simpler sugars.

**Predicted property value: -1.2**  
(Estimated based on the trend of increasing polarity/oxygenation leading to more negative values, but not as extreme as large hydrophobic + polar mixed structures). 

This is an educated guess given the limited examples and lack of explicit rules, but it fits the observed trend.

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.5507069021279681
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene), which has a property value of **1.06856276**. This suggests that triple bonds (C#C) may contribute to higher property values, especially when conjugated or part of an electron-withdrawing group (like cyano, C#N).

2. **Simple Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptan-4-ol): **0.37407101**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (hexadecanol): **0.20043106**
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (pentan-2-one): **0.20612343**
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (4-methylpentan-2-one): **1.17964514**
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal): **-0.31180371**

   Saturated hydrocarbons or simple functionalized chains tend to have property values in the range of **-0.3 to 0.4**, with carbonyls (C=O) sometimes increasing or decreasing the value unpredictably.

3. **Terminal Alkynes vs. Internal Alkynes**:
   - **CCC#C** is a terminal alkyne (C-H bond at the triple bond), while **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** is an internal alkyne. Terminal alkynes are slightly more polar due to the acidic proton, but this may not directly translate to the property value here.

4. **Conjugation and Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing/donating groups have varied values (e.g., **COc1ccccc1Cl**: **0.53927351**, **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: **0.67449076**).
   - Non-aromatic alkynes like **CCC#C** lack conjugation, so their values may be lower than conjugated alkynes.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- The molecule is a simple terminal alkyne with no conjugation or strong functional groups. 
- Compared to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (internal alkyne with conjugation and cyano groups), **CCC#C** should have a significantly lower value.
- Compared to saturated hydrocarbons like **CCCC(O)CCC** (~0.37) or **CCCC(=O)C** (~0.21), the triple bond might slightly increase the value due to its polarizability, but not as much as in conjugated systems.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCC#C** is around **0.3 to 0.5**. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.45** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between simple hydrocarbons and conjugated alkynes). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâe.g., logP, dipole moment, or another descriptorâthis is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.5617289047388602
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in some of the examples (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with property **0.22667713** and `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` with property **3.96318768**). This group tends to contribute to higher property values, especially when combined with other polar or bulky substituents.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions**: The `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` fragment resembles molecules like `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property **0.05889441**) and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` (property **0.99796075**). Multiple chlorines on an aromatic ring generally increase the property value, but the exact effect depends on substitution patterns.
3. **Ethoxy and ethyl groups**: The `CCOP` and `CC` fragments are less polar and may slightly reduce the property value compared to more polar substituents.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The molecule `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a property of **0.22667713**. This is somewhat similar but has additional polar amide and carbonyl groups.
- The molecule `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` (simpler dichlorobenzene) has a property of **0.99796075**, but our molecule has more chlorines and a bulky P=S group.
- The molecule `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has a very high property value (**3.96318768**), but it is much more complex with multiple polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the P=S group and multiple chlorines on the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be **moderately positive**. The exact value is hard to pinpoint, but based on the examples, a reasonable estimate would be between **0.5 and 1.5**. 

A more precise prediction, considering the balance between the P=S group (increasing the value) and the less polar ethoxy/ethyl groups (slightly decreasing it), would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.24674541662299235
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NHâ, -NOâ, halogens)** tend to have higher (more positive) property values.
   - Molecules with **nonpolar aliphatic chains (e.g., C=C, CCCC)** have lower (more negative) values.
   - Aromatic systems with **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NOâ)** often have moderately positive values (e.g., Clc1ccccc1Cl: 0.783).
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) with polar substituents tend to have values in the **0.2 to 0.6 range** (e.g., Nc1cccc2ccccc12: 0.362; Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2: 0.573).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The hydrazide group (**C(=O)NN**) is more polar than simple halogens or amines, similar to **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2** (0.573) or **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (0.533).
   - The pyridine ring is less electron-rich than benzene, but the hydrazide group adds significant polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong hydrogen-bonding capability and polarity of the hydrazide group, the value should be **higher than simple aromatic halides but not as extreme as highly nitrated or sulfonated compounds**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.55**  

This aligns with similar nitrogen-rich polar molecules in the dataset (e.g., 0.573 for the imidazole derivative). The exact value may vary slightly, but 0.55 is a chemically plausible prediction based on the examples.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.4219529427198055
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (property = 0.50719816). This group often contributes to moderate positive or near-zero property values.
2. **Thioester (SCC(=O))**: The presence of sulfur and carbonyl groups can influence the property, but no exact match in the examples.
3. **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Present in a cyclic structure (N1CCCCC1C). Amides like **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** have high positive values (1.76474763), but cyclic amides may differ.
4. **Alkyl chains (CCCO, OCCC, etc.)**: These are neutral contributors unless paired with strongly polar or functional groups.
5. **Overall polarity and size**: The molecule is large and polar, which may lower the property value compared to smaller polar molecules.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: Property = 0.50719816 (phosphorothioate + nitro groups).
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**: Property = 1.76474763 (high due to amide and dimethyl groups).
- **CC(C)OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = -0.30962765 (amide + ester + chloro group).
- **CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23**: Property = -0.8422773 (complex amide + aromatic).

The given molecule has a phosphorothioate (moderate positive contribution) and a cyclic amide (likely moderate positive), but the large size and additional alkyl/ether groups may reduce the overall property. 

### Predicted property:
Given the balance of moderately positive (P(=S), amide) and neutral/negative (alkyl chains, size) contributions, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 0.45** (similar to phosphorothioate-containing examples but slightly lowered by the bulky structure). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâe.g., logP, solubility, etc.âthis is an educated guess based on the trend in the examples.)

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.36639592191884474
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics):**
   - **CC(Cl)Cl** (dichloropropane): -0.758  
   - **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (cyclohexane derivative): -0.843  
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol): -0.366  
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -0.064  
   - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexyl-substituted alkane): -1.543  

   Alkanes and saturated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, with longer chains or cyclic structures showing more negative values.

2. **Functional Groups:**
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers) often increase the property value (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)CO**: 1.083).  
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **ClCCBr**: -1.422).  
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., nitro, hydroxyl) can vary widely.  

3. **Octane (CCCCCCCC):**
   - This is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups or halogens.  
   - Comparing to similar molecules:  
     - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol, 7 carbons + OH): -0.366. Removing the -OH would likely make the value more negative.  
     - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (branched/cyclic): -1.543. Straight chains are less negative than cyclic/branched analogs.  
     - **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (cyclohexane): -0.843. Octane is less cyclic but longer.  

### Prediction:
Octane is a saturated, linear hydrocarbon with no polar groups. Based on the examples:  
- Longer alkanes have more negative values than shorter ones.  
- Linear alkanes are less negative than cyclic/branched ones.  
- The closest analog is **CCCCCCCO** (-0.366), but without the -OH, octane should be more negative.  

Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCC** is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.85**  

This aligns with the cyclohexane derivative (-0.843) and accounts for the longer chain.  

### Final Answer:  
**-0.85**

Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -1.9396071075795465
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Presence of polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -NOâ, halogens)**: These often increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` = 0.674, `Brc1ccccc1Br` = 0.783).
2. **Ring systems and conjugation**: Aromatic rings or conjugated systems tend to have moderate values (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` = -0.153, `NC(=O)c1ccccc1` = 0.492).
3. **Hydrophobic/aliphatic chains**: These often decrease the property value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` = -1.374, `CCC1CCCCC1` = -1.136).
4. **Complexity and functional group combinations**: Molecules with multiple functional groups or fused rings show intermediate values (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` = -1.966, `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` = -1.949).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`

1. **Structure**: This is a **steroid-like fused polycyclic system** with:
   - A **carbonyl group (C=O)**.
   - Two **hydroxyl groups (-OH)**.
   - A **terminal alkyne (C#C)**.
   - Multiple fused rings (steroid backbone).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (property = -1.966) and `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (property = -1.949), which are also steroid-like with C=O and -OH groups.
   - The additional **terminal alkyne** might slightly increase the property (alkynes are moderately polar but less than -OH/C=O).

3. **Expected Property**:
   - The presence of **two -OH groups and a C=O** would typically give a value around **-1.5 to -2.0** based on similar examples.
   - The alkyne might raise this slightly, but the dominant effect is the hydrophobic fused ring system.

### Predicted Property:
**-1.75** (interpolated between -1.966 and -1.682 for similar structures). 

This aligns with the trend where steroid-like molecules with polar groups but large hydrophobic cores have values in this range.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2.669849052628284
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the training data to predict the property value.

### **Molecule Structure Analysis:**
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
- **Aromatic rings** (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`)
- **Ether linkages** (`OC`, `OCO`)
- **Lactone-like ring** (`COC2=O`)
- **Multiple oxygen-containing groups** (hydroxyl `OH`, methoxy `OCH3`)
- **Fused ring systems** (`C6C2C...c7cc5OCOc5cc67`)

### **Comparison with Training Data:**
1. **Oxygen-rich aromatic systems** (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` â **0.783**, `COc1ccccc1Cl` â **0.539**) tend to have moderately positive values.
2. **Polycyclic aromatic systems** (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` â **-1.331**) tend to have negative values.
3. **Highly oxygenated aliphatic systems** (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br` â **3.091**) can have very high values, but this is an outlier.
4. **Molecules with multiple fused rings and oxygen functionalities** (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` â **-2.647**) tend to have strongly negative values.

### **Prediction:**
Given the **high oxygen content, fused ring systems, and aromaticity**, this molecule likely has a **negative property value**, similar to other complex polycyclic oxygenated structures in the training set. 

However, the presence of **methoxy and hydroxyl groups** may slightly offset the negativity compared to purely hydrocarbon polycyclics. 

### **Final Predicted Value:**
**-1.45** (estimated based on structural similarity to highly oxygenated polycyclic compounds in the training set). 

This balances the negative contribution from fused rings with the slightly positive influence of oxygen substituents.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.7832194619854209
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities with other molecules. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule is a phenol derivative with a chlorine substituent (chlorophenol). Similar molecules in the dataset include:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): Property = 0.6597382  
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol, possibly a different isomer): Property = 0.81758609  
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene): Property = 0.78321946  
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene): Property = 0.56767417  

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The presence of an **electron-withdrawing group (Cl)** on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted phenol (not in the dataset, but we can infer from trends).
   - The hydroxyl group (**OH**) is electron-donating, but the chlorine (**Cl**) is weakly electron-withdrawing, leading to a balance. The property value is likely between the nitrophenol and fluorobenzene examples.

3. **Comparison with Clc1ccccc1I**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene) has a property of **0.78321946**, which is close to what we might expect for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, as both have a chlorine substituent and similar aromatic systems. The hydroxyl group in **Oc1ccccc1Cl** may slightly lower the value compared to the iodine substituent in **Clc1ccccc1I**.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the similarities, the property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is likely in the range of **0.65 to 0.78**. A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **Clc1ccccc1I** (0.783) but higher than **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (0.659).  

### Final Predicted Property Value: **0.72**

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.6206312614147376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` in some examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (similar to `NC(=O)` in some examples).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly present in examples, but triple bonds are rare in the dataset).
   - **Chlorinated alkyl chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` in examples).
   - **Ether linkage**: `COC` (similar to `COC` in some examples).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The molecule has polar groups (amide, Cl substituents) and an alkyne (moderately polar).
   - The Cl-substituted aromatic ring and amide suggest moderate electron-withdrawing effects.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with Cl-substituted aromatics and amides (e.g., `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` with property `-0.7898604`) tend to have negative property values.
   - The alkyne and ether might slightly increase the property value compared to purely Cl/amide-heavy molecules.
   - The presence of two Cl atoms (one on the aromatic ring and one on the alkyl chain) suggests a value closer to `-0.7` to `-1.0`.

4. **Closest Analogues**:
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (`-0.7898604`): Similar Cl/amide complexity.
   - `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F` (`-1.01562656`): More Cl/F substitutions, more negative.
   - `CCCCl` (`-1.42194855`): Simple Cl-terminated alkyl, but lacks aromatic/amide features.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of Cl substitutions, amide, and alkyne/ether, the property value is likely **between -0.7 and -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  

This aligns with the trends observed in the dataset for similar functional group combinations.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.851551034704321
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular properties like polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central oxygen (O) attached to three aromatic rings:
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (heteroaromatic): **c2cncnc2**
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring: **c3ccccc3Cl**

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: Likely contributes to hydrogen bonding (negative contribution to the property, as seen in other hydroxylated aromatics like `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` with a value of 0.588).
   - **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Increase polarity/hydrophobicity (positive contribution, e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has 0.674).
   - **Heteroaromatic ring (c2cncnc2)**: Similar to `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (0.201) or `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (0.621), but with less hydrogen bonding.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Three aromatic rings (two phenyl, one pyrimidine) with extended conjugation. Multi-ring systems like `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (0.361) or `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (-0.152) show moderate values.

4. **Polarity and Sterics**:
   - The hydroxyl and chlorines increase polarity, but the bulky aromatic systems may offset this.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are molecules with multiple aromatic rings and polar substituents:
  - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (-0.472): Similar chlorinated biphenyl with additional Cl, but our molecule has a hydroxyl and heteroaromatic ring.
  - `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (-1.067): Diphenylamine (less polar than our molecule).
  - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (0.588): Simpler dihydroxybenzene.

### Prediction:
Given the hydroxyl group (negative contribution), two chlorines (positive contribution), and the heteroaromatic ring (moderate positive contribution), the property likely balances out to a **moderate negative value**. 

Considering the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This aligns with the structural complexity and polar interactions observed in similar molecules.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.31180370893473464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of **CCCCOC=O**:
1. **Functional Group**: The molecule contains an ester group (**-OC=O**), which is polar and can influence the property value.
2. **Chain Length**: It has a butyl chain (**CCCC**), which is moderately long and hydrophobic.
3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a property value of **0.63174477**. This is also an ester with a similar chain length.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (methyl acetoacetate) is not directly comparable, but esters with shorter chains tend to have lower values.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has a value of **-0.31180371**, but this is an aldehyde, not an ester.
   - **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate) is not in the dataset, but butyl formate is expected to have a slightly higher value than propyl formate due to the longer chain.

### Key Observations:
- Esters with moderate chain lengths (like ethyl butyrate) tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**.
- The presence of the formate group (**-OC=O**) may slightly lower the value compared to larger esters like ethyl butyrate.
- Butyl formate is less polar than ethyl butyrate due to the longer alkyl chain, which could reduce the property value slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to **CCCC(=O)OCC (0.63174477)** but with a slightly less polar structure, I predict the property value for **CCCCOC=O** to be:

**0.55** (approximate, likely between 0.5 and 0.6). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking more closely:
- The formate group is smaller than the butyrate group, which may reduce the value slightly.
- The butyl chain is longer than the ethyl chain in ethyl butyrate, which could also reduce polarity slightly.

Thus, a more precise estimate would be:

**0.58** (closer to the ester trend but adjusted for chain length and formate group). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **0.58**.

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2.0715555858337034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the examples:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Alkanes**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **-1.42194855**.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) also has a property value of **-2.07155559**, but this is the same as **CNN**, suggesting this might be an outlier or a default value for very small molecules with certain halogens.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a high value of **1.39278252**, likely due to aromaticity and multiple chlorines.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** is a small, non-aromatic, chlorinated alkane with a value of **-1.42194855**.
   - **ClCCl** is even smaller (dichloromethane), so we might expect a similar or slightly lower value due to reduced size and symmetry compared to ClCCCl.

3. **Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CCCC** (butane) has the same value as **ClCCCl** (-1.42194855), suggesting that small alkanes and small chlorinated alkanes may have similar property values in this dataset.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
Given that:
- **ClCCCl** has a value of **-1.42194855**,
- **CCCC** (similarly small but non-halogenated) has the same value,
- **ClCCl** is smaller than **ClCCCl** but similarly chlorinated,

it is reasonable to predict that **ClCCl** would have a property value close to **-1.42194855**. There is no evidence in the examples that smaller chlorinated alkanes deviate significantly from this trend.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **-1.42194855**.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.9979607450438149
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol-like structures (aromatic ring with -OH)**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): **0.67449076**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol): **0.70311575**
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): **0.6597382**
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., -CH3) tend to have **positive property values** (~0.6 to 0.7).

2. **Methyl-substituted aromatics**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,5-dimethylphenol). 
   - The presence of two methyl groups is likely to further increase the property value compared to single-methyl phenols due to enhanced electron donation.

3. **Other relevant examples**:
   - Simple phenol (**Oc1ccccc1**) is not in the dataset, but substituted phenols with -CH3 or -OCH3 (e.g., **COc1ccc(C=CC)cc1**: **0.19240833**) show variability based on substitution.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **0.70311575**,
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has an additional methyl group (2,5-dimethylphenol), which is likely to slightly increase the property value due to additive electron-donating effects,

the predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** would be **~0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**0.75** (approximate, based on structural analogy and trends).

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.1893768870517522
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.18528079**
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.13791609**
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **1.39278252** (higher due to the presence of -OH)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Not explicitly given, but similar to the above.

2. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)**-like structure with two benzene rings connected and multiple chlorine substituents.
   - The property values for such structures tend to be **low to moderate positive values** (e.g., ~0.1 to ~0.2).
   - The presence of more chlorines generally increases the property slightly, but not drastically (compare 0.137 and 0.185 for similar structures).

3. **Comparison with Given Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.18528079).
   - The new molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is very similar but has slightly fewer chlorines (5 Cl vs. 6 Cl in the example). This suggests the property might be slightly lower.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example with property **0.18528079** but with one fewer chlorine, I predict the property for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** to be:

**Predicted Property: 0.15** (slightly lower than 0.185 due to reduced chlorination). 

(Note: If more precision is required, a value around **0.16** could also be reasonable, but the trend suggests it should be slightly less than 0.185.) 

### Final Answer:
**0.15** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data).

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.7990642724746111
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains/Alkenes**: 
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a property value of **-0.03616825**.
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane) has a property value of **-0.36639592**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon) has a higher value of **1.06045217**, suggesting branching may increase the property value.

2. **Alkenes vs. Alkanes**: 
   - The presence of a double bond (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**) seems to slightly increase the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., **CCCCCCCC**).

3. **Branched Alkenes**: 
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isoprene), similar to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** but with a double bond. Given that branching increases the value and the double bond may also contribute, we can expect a higher value than **CCCCCCCCC=C** (-0.036) but lower than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (1.060).

4. **Other Examples**: 
   - **CC(=O)C** (acetone) is not directly comparable, but carbonyl groups tend to lower the value (not relevant here).
   - **CC=C** (propene) is not in the examples, but smaller alkenes might have lower values.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- The molecule is a branched alkene with a structure less complex than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** but more branched than **CCCCCCCCC=C**.
- Given the trends, a reasonable estimate would be between **0.5 and 1.0**.
- A plausible value is **~0.75**, considering the double bond and branching effects.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.75** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data patterns.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2.0715555858337034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) by analyzing trends in the data. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Observed Trends**:
   - Molecules with **higher chlorine content** (e.g., perchlorinated compounds like hexachlorobenzene or octachlorocubane) tend to have **moderate positive values** (e.g., 0.196 for Clâ-phane, 1.811 for CClâ=CClâ).
   - Small, simple chlorinated alkanes (e.g., CClâ analogs) are not explicitly in the dataset, but related structures suggest **positive values**.
   - The presence of **oxygen or nitrogen** often reduces the property value (e.g., alcohols, amides), but **ClCCl** lacks these.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **1.811**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a value of **0.196**.
   - **ClCCl** is simpler and less chlorinated than these, so we expect a **lower but still positive value**.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given its small size and two chlorines, the property value is likely **between 0.5 and 1.5**.
   - A reasonable estimate is **~0.9**, considering the balance between chlorine's positive contribution and the molecule's simplicity.

**Final predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.92** (approximate).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâe.g., logP, solubility, etc.âthis is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.1772439286707685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated aromatic rings**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is very similar to the target molecule but with slightly different substitution) has a property value of **1.11713836**. 
   - The molecule **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (fully brominated benzene) has a value of **0.84178131**, suggesting that heavy halogen substitution increases the property value.
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is a trichlorophenol, and its value is already high (1.11713836).

2. **Target molecule**: 
   - The target is **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which is also a trichlorophenol but with a slightly different substitution pattern (1,2,4-trichlorophenol instead of 1,2,3-trichlorophenol). 
   - The difference in substitution (meta vs. ortho/para) may slightly affect the property, but the overall impact of three chlorines and a hydroxyl group is likely similar.

3. **Other trends**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** at 0.841, **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** at 1.117).
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) does not drastically lower the value (as seen in the trichlorophenol example).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (1.11713836), the target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** will likely have a very close value, possibly slightly lower due to the less crowded substitution pattern (1,2,4 vs. 1,2,3). 

**Predicted property value: ~1.05** (slightly lower than 1.117 due to the meta substitution effect). 

However, since the examples show that trichlorophenols are consistently high, another reasonable estimate is to assume the same value as the very similar example: **1.117**. 

Given the data, the most precise answer is to match the nearly identical example:  
**Predicted value: 1.11713836** (same as **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**). 

But if we must distinguish, a slight decrease to **1.05** could be argued. For consistency with the given examples, I will stick to the original example's value. 

### Final answer:
**1.11713836** (same as the provided trichlorophenol example).

True Property: -2.669849052628284
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and trends in the given data to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCHâ) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: From the examples, aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -OCHâ, -NOâ) tend to have property values in the range of -1.0 to +1.0. For example:
   - `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 0.533.
   - `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` has a value of 1.117.
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2` has a value of -0.430.

2. **Multiple oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., furan-like rings, sugar-like moieties)**: Molecules with multiple oxygenated rings (e.g., sugars) tend to have negative property values. For example:
   - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of -1.155.
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` has a value of -2.046.

3. **Lactone or carbonyl groups (C=O)**: These groups often contribute to more negative values when part of a rigid cyclic system. For example:
   - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of -1.669.

4. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, which could lower the property value (as seen in large polycyclic systems like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` with -0.970).

### Trends from Examples:
- Simple aliphatic chains or halides tend to have more negative values (e.g., `CCCCl` at -1.421, `ClCC` at -2.071).
- Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -NHâ) reduce the property value.
- Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NOâ, -Cl) can increase or decrease the value depending on context.
- Highly oxygenated or polycyclic systems (e.g., steroids, sugars) tend to have strongly negative values.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is highly oxygenated, contains multiple aromatic rings with polar substituents, and has a large polycyclic framework. These features suggest a property value in the **negative range**, likely between -1.0 and -2.0. Given the complexity and similarity to sugar-like or steroid-like examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` at -2.046), I predict a value closer to the lower end of this range.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-1.75** (estimated based on structural similarity to highly oxygenated polycyclic examples).

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.2816697907869326
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group attached. The ring also has:
   - A **carbonyl (=O)** group.
   - An **amino (NH)** group.
   - A bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - The **thiomethyl (CS)** group is moderately polar but less polar than an alcohol or amine.
   - The **carbonyl (=O)** and **NH** groups add polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   - The **tert-butyl group** is hydrophobic and bulky, reducing overall polarity.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 1.16572323): This has a similar pyrimidone-like structure with NH and carbonyl groups, but lacks the bulky tert-butyl and thiomethyl groups. Its value is relatively high (~1.17).
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = -0.81564947): This has a thioether (similar to CS), a carbonyl, and a tert-butyl group. Its value is negative (~ -0.82).
   - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = 0.20164531): This is a polar heterocycle but lacks the bulky tert-butyl group.

### Key Observations:
- The **tert-butyl group** tends to reduce the property value (as seen in the second example above).
- The **thiomethyl (CS)** group is less polar than an OH or NH2, contributing to a lower value.
- The **carbonyl and NH** groups add some polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl group counteracts this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar groups (carbonyl, NH) and the non-polar bulky tert-butyl group, the property value is likely **moderately negative**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.65**  

This aligns with the trend observed in similar molecules (e.g., the second example with a value of -0.82, but here the presence of the NH group slightly increases the value).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05666275602925446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene)**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1`, `c1ccccc1`) tend to have property values around **0.5 to 0.8** unless strongly perturbed by substituents.
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) reduce the value slightly, while electron-donating groups (e.g., amino) increase it.

2. **Esters (R-COOR')**:
   - Esters like `CCCC(=O)OC` and `CCCCC(=O)OCC` have values around **0.47 to 0.64**.
   - The property seems slightly higher when the ester is part of a larger/aliphatic system.

3. **Phenyl Esters (Aromatic + Ester)**:
   - The molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is an ethyl ester of benzoic acid (ethyl benzoate). 
   - Similar examples:
     - `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` has a value of **1.097** (but this is more complex with multiple substituents).
     - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (cyclic imide) has **0.727**.
   - Simpler esters like `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) have **0.643**.

4. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The phenyl ring with an ester (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`) is less polarizable than aliphatic esters, so the value may be slightly lower than aliphatic esters but higher than bare benzene.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Ethyl benzoate (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`) is structurally similar to `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate, **0.643**) but with a phenyl ring instead of an alkyl chain. 
- Phenyl rings in similar contexts (e.g., `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, **-0.061**) can reduce the value, but this example has additional carbonyls.
- Simpler phenyl esters are not explicitly in the examples, but interpolating between aliphatic esters and benzene derivatives suggests a value **between 0.4 and 0.7**.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.55**, considering:
- The ester group adds a slight positive contribution (~0.6 from aliphatic esters).
- The phenyl ring is less polarizable than aliphatic chains, so the value is slightly reduced.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: 0.55** (approximate, likely in the range 0.5â0.6).

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.36639592191884474
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides**: 
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a very low property value of **-3.27475897**, likely due to the high polarizability and size of iodine.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (a polychlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.36538025**, indicating that multiple chlorines reduce the property value but not as drastically as iodine.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.20164531**, suggesting that bromine in an aromatic system doesn't drastically lower the property.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a value of **-0.20248357**.
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-heptanol) has a value of **-0.36639592**, indicating that adding a polar group (OH) reduces the property slightly.
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (4-heptanone) has a value of **0.63174477**, showing that a carbonyl group increases the property.

3. **Bromine in Aliphatic Chains**:
   - There are no direct examples of simple alkyl bromides, but we can infer from the trends:
     - Bromine is less polarizable than iodine but more than chlorine, so its effect should be between the two.
     - The property value for **CCCCCCCBr** should be higher than **CI** (-3.274) but lower than neutral alkanes or slightly polar molecules.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- The molecule is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). 
- Comparing to **CCCCCCCO** (1-heptanol, -0.366) and **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene, -0.202), bromine is less polar than OH but more polarizable than a double bond. 
- The presence of bromine likely reduces the property slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons but not as drastically as iodine. 
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **CCCCCCC=C** but higher than **CCCCCCCO**.

Given these trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is approximately:  
**-0.25** (estimated based on interpolation between similar structures). 

However, looking at **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (0.2016, bromoaromatic) and **CI** (-3.274, iodoalkane), the effect of bromine in an aliphatic chain is likely less negative than in an aromatic system. A more precise estimate might be closer to **-0.15 to -0.30**. 

Given the examples, a plausible prediction is:  
**-0.28** (this balances the slight reduction due to bromine with the alkyl chain's neutral contribution). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **-0.28**.

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -3.2747589721483004
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol)**:

1. **Simple, polar molecules with an -OH group** tend to have property values in the moderately negative range. For example:
   - **OC1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol)**: -1.058477  
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O (a sugar derivative)**: 0.00246076  
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a branched alcohol)**: -0.54298398  

2. **Methanol (CO)** is a very small, polar molecule with a single -OH group. Compared to larger alcohols or polyols, it lacks additional complexity (e.g., rings, multiple functional groups) that might push the value toward extremes.  

3. The presence of the -OH group suggests a value less negative than non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC: -2.07155559**) but not as extreme as highly polar or conjugated systems (e.g., **NC(N)=NC#N: 1.49100978**).  

### Predicted Property Value for **CO**:  
**-0.5**  

This is a reasonable estimate based on the trend observed for small alcohols in the dataset.  

*(Note: The property appears to be a computed or experimental descriptor, possibly related to logP, solubility, or another physicochemical parameter. Without explicit clarification, this prediction is based on structural analogies.)*
