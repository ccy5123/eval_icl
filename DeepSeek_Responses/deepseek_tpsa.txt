SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with certain structural features, particularly the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, nitro, etc.) and the absence of highly halogenated or purely hydrocarbon structures (which often have a value of 0.0). 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate), we can observe the following:
1. It contains an ester group (**C(=O)OC**), which is polar and contributes to the property value.
2. The molecule is not highly halogenated or purely hydrocarbon (it has a functional group).
3. Similar molecules with ester or carbonyl groups and moderate chain lengths (e.g., **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is methyl octanoate, though not explicitly listed) or analogous structures like **CCCC(C)O** (20.23) or **CCOC(=O)CC** (26.3) suggest values in the 20-30 range.

The closest analog in the given examples is **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate), which is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (not explicitly listed but analogous to shorter-chain esters like **CCOC(=O)CC** with a value of 26.3). Given the longer carbon chain, the value might slightly decrease due to reduced polarity per unit mass, but the ester group's contribution remains significant.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is likely **26.3**, matching the trend observed for similar ester-containing molecules in the dataset. 

**Final answer: 26.3**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 46.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with only halogens (Cl, Br), aliphatic chains, or simple aromatic systems without polar functional groups (e.g., ClC=C, BrC(Cl)Cl, CCCC#C, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl).
   - Highly halogenated or non-polar structures tend to have this property.

2. **Property = 20.23**: 
   - Molecules with a single hydroxyl group (-OH) or ether (-O-) attached to an aliphatic or aromatic system (e.g., CCC(O)CC, OC1CCCCCCC1, CO, Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1).
   - The presence of one polar group (like -OH) often correlates with this value.

3. **Property = 75.27**: 
   - Molecules with multiple amide or urea-like functionalities (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C).
   - These structures often contain **two or more N-C=O (amide/imide) groups**.

4. **Other Values**:
   - Values like 29.1, 25.78, 54.86, etc., are associated with specific heterocyclic or mixed functional groups (e.g., thioamides, nitro groups, or complex fused rings).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, which can be rewritten as:

```
     Cl
      |
     c2
    /   \
  c1     c3
  ||     |
  o      c4
  |      |
  C=O    c5
   |     |
  [nH]   c6
      \ /
       c7
```

Key features:
1. A **chlorinated benzene ring** (Cl attached to an aromatic ring).
2. A **fused lactam-like structure** (oc(=O)[nH]), which is a cyclic amide (similar to a uracil or barbiturate core but smaller).
   - The `oc(=O)[nH]` moiety is a **cyclic amide (lactam)** with a carbonyl (C=O) and NH group.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 29.1) has a similar cyclic thioamide structure.
- The molecule **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (property = 54.86) has a more complex fused ring with two amide groups.
- The molecule **O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1** (property = 75.27) has two amide groups in a ring.

Since the target molecule has **one cyclic amide group** (not two like the 75.27 examples) and no additional polar groups beyond the Cl and lactam, it is most similar to **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 29.1) but with a slightly less polar lactam (oxygen instead of sulfur). 

However, the presence of the aromatic ring and Cl might reduce the property slightly compared to purely cyclic amides. 

### Predicted Property:
Given the examples, the closest match is likely **29.1**, but since the lactam here is less polarizing than a thioamide, a slightly lower value is plausible. However, no exact match exists in the examples, so the safest bet is **29.1**.

**Final Answer: 29.1**
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 43.14
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):**
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **81.19**.
   - The nitro group is highly polar and can significantly increase the property value when present in certain contexts.

2. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds:**
   - The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is an aliphatic nitro compound (specifically, 2-nitropropane). 
   - From the examples, aliphatic nitro compounds are not explicitly listed, but nitro groups generally contribute to higher property values unless counterbalanced by other features (e.g., symmetry, non-polar groups).

3. **Other Functional Groups:**
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -NO2, -SO, -CO) tend to have higher property values unless they are symmetrically substituted or part of a non-polar scaffold (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** has a value of **0.0** due to symmetry).
   - Simple aliphatic chains or non-polar molecules (e.g., **CCCCCl**, **CCC(C)CC**) have values of **0.0**.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules:**
   - The molecule **CCCOCC** (an ether) has a value of **9.23**, while **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is more polar due to the nitro group.
   - The molecule **NC(=O)CCl** (chloroacetamide) has a value of **43.09**, and the nitro group in **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is similarly polar or more so.

### Prediction for **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
Given the presence of the nitro group (a strong electron-withdrawing and polar functional group) and the lack of symmetry or counterbalancing non-polar features, the property value should be moderately high. 

Looking at similar polar but non-symmetrical molecules:
- **NC(=O)CCl**: 43.09  
- **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**: 81.19 (higher due to additional polar groups and heterocycle)  
- **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is less polar than the heterocyclic nitro example but more polar than simple aliphatic compounds.

A reasonable estimate would be between **40 and 50**. 

### Final Prediction:
**Property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O: 45.0** (approximate, based on structural analogy and polarity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., solubility, dipole moment, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend that nitro groups increase the property value in the given examples.)

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 74.6
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Steroids/Ketones**: Molecules with steroid-like structures or ketone groups (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`) tend to have values around **34.14**.
   - The given molecule is a steroid derivative with multiple rings, hydroxyl (`OH`), and carbonyl (`C=O`) groups, similar to this example.
2. **Hydroxyl and Carbonyl Groups**: The presence of `OH` and `C=O` (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` with **75.27**) can increase the value, but the steroid backbone seems to dominate in this case.
3. **No Halogens or Aromatic Systems**: The molecule lacks halogens (Cl, Br, I, F) or purely aromatic systems, which often result in **0.0** in the examples.

### Structural Similarity:
The given molecule closely resembles `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (value: **34.14**), but with additional polar groups (`OH` and `C(=O)CO`). These additions may slightly increase the property value due to enhanced polarity/hydrogen bonding.

### Predicted Value:
Given the steroid backbone and the additional polar functional groups, the predicted property value is likely slightly higher than **34.14**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**~36.0** (rounded to one decimal place as in the examples).

However, since the examples show that steroid-like structures with ketones hover around **34.14**, and no clear trend suggests a significant increase for the extra `OH`/`C(=O)CO`, the most conservative prediction is:  
**34.14** (same as the closest analogous example).

### Final Answer:
**34.1** (rounded to one decimal place).

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 58.2
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to deduce the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity (or lack thereof)**:
   - Molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC...CC) or purely hydrocarbon/aromatic structures (e.g., c1ccccc1) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain polar functional groups.
   - Halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, BrC(Br)(Br)Br) also tend to have **0.0** unless paired with polar groups.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: Often associated with values like **20.23** (e.g., CCCC(O)CC, Cc1cccc(C)c1O).
   - **Ethers (-O-)**: Lower polarity than -OH, e.g., O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has **9.23**.
   - **Amides (-C(=O)N-)**: Higher polarity, e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 has **38.05**, and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has **55.98**.
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: Contributes to polarity, e.g., CCCC=O has **17.07**.
   - **Multiple polar groups**: Can significantly increase the value (e.g., OCC2OC(...)C(O)C(O)C2O has **119.61**).

3. **Combination of Groups**:
   - Molecules with both aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., amides, hydroxyls) tend to have intermediate to high values depending on the number and type of polar groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**  
- Contains two aromatic rings (fluorinated and chlorinated).
- Has **two amide groups (-C(=O)N-)**, which are highly polar.
- No long aliphatic chains or purely hydrophobic regions.

### Similar Examples:
1. **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (amide-like + aromatic): **38.05**  
2. **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (amide + aromatic): **55.98**  
3. **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** (amide-like + aromatic): **68.01**  

The target molecule has **two amide groups**, which would increase polarity compared to single-amide examples. However, the fluorinated/chlorinated aromatic rings may slightly reduce the overall polarity compared to purely non-halogenated cases.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the presence of two amide groups and halogenated aromatics, the value is likely between **38.05** (single amide) and **68.01** (amide + hydrazine). A reasonable estimate is **~55-60**, leaning toward the higher end due to the two amides.

From the examples, **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (single amide + aromatic) is **55.98**, so the target (two amides) should be higher. The closest match is likely **~60-70**.

However, the exact value isn't in the examples, but the most plausible prediction is:  
**68.01** (similar to c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, which also has a polar group + aromatic).  

### Final Answer:  
**68.01**
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 9.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Hydrophilicity/Polarity Indicator**: The property value seems to correlate with the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -C=O, -N-, -S=O, halogens like F/Cl/Br/I, etc.). Molecules with these groups tend to have higher values, while purely hydrocarbon structures (e.g., alkanes, aromatics without polar groups) have a value of **0.0**.
   - Examples: 
     - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (pure hydrocarbon) → **0.0**
     - `CCCC#C` (alkyne hydrocarbon) → **0.0**
     - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (hydrocarbon) → **0.0**
     - `Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1` (aromatic hydrocarbon) → **0.0**

2. **Ether/Alcohol Contribution**: 
   - Ethers (`-O-`) and alcohols (`-OH`) tend to have moderate values (e.g., **20.23** for `CCC(C)(O)CC` or `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O`).
   - The value **20.23** appears frequently for small alcohols/ethers with limited additional polarity (e.g., `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` has **26.02** due to the -NH2 group, which is more polar than -OH/-O-).

3. **Structure of CCCOC(C)C**:
   - The molecule is **propyl isopropyl ether** (`CCCOC(C)C`), containing an ether linkage (`-O-`) but no other polar groups.
   - It is structurally similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (value **20.23**) and `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (value **20.23**), where the -OH or -O- group is the sole polar feature.

### Prediction:
Since **CCCOC(C)C** is an ether with no additional polar groups, its value should align with other simple ethers/alcohols in the dataset. The most consistent value for such cases is **20.23**.

### Final Answer:
**20.23**
==================================================
Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 54.86
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is present in some of the examples (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` with a value of 29.1).
   - It has a **diketopiperazine-like core** (two carbonyl groups attached to a nitrogen-containing ring), similar to structures like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (75.27) or `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (61.69).
   - The **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is attached to the nitrogen, which is somewhat analogous to the alkyl substitutions in other examples.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The presence of **NH and C=O groups** suggests significant hydrogen bonding potential, which often correlates with higher property values in the examples (e.g., 59.32–75.27 for similar polar structures).
   - The **bromine** adds some polarity but is less influential than hydrogen-bonding groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analogs are molecules with cyclic amides/carbamates and halogen substitutions:
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (29.1) has a bromine but lacks the cyclic diketopiperazine core.
     - `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (61.69) has a similar cyclic structure with Cl instead of Br.
     - `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` (46.26) has a complex heterocycle but no Br.

### Prediction:
Given the **cyclic diketopiperazine-like core + Br substitution**, the property value is likely in the **mid-to-high range** (similar to 61.69 for the Cl analog). However, Br is less polar than Cl, and the alkyl group (CCC(C)) may slightly reduce the value compared to aromatic substitutions. 

**Predicted value: ~58.0**  
*(This is a rough estimate based on structural similarity to examples like `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (61.69) and `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` (46.26), adjusted for Br vs. Cl and alkyl substitution.)* 

### Refined Estimate:
Given the examples, a reasonable prediction is **~58.12** (close to `Cc3ccnc4N(C1CC1)c2ncccc2C(=O)Nc34`). 

**Final answer: 58.12**
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (which is biphenyl), I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Molecules with simple aromatic systems (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, or fused aromatic rings without polar substituents) tend to have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (methylnaphthalene): 0.0
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene): 0.0
   - `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (benzocyclohexane): 0.0
   - `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (dimethylnaphthalene): 0.0

2. **Polar or Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., nitro, amino, carbonyl, halogens) tend to have non-zero values. Examples:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene): 86.28
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` (sulfanilamide): 86.18
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)C(C)C` (hydantoin derivative): 75.27

3. **Biphenyl Structure**: The molecule `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl) consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. It lacks polar or functional groups and is purely aromatic, similar to naphthalene or other unsubstituted polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the dataset.

4. **Conclusion**: Since biphenyl is a simple, non-polar aromatic system like the other examples with a value of 0.0, its predicted property value is **0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value: 0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), I can make the following observations:

1. **Property Trends**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatics without polar groups) typically have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`, `CCC1CCCCC1`, `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`).
   - Molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -CO, -SO₃H, halogens) often have non-zero values (e.g., `NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` has 122.06, `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` has 126.65).
   - Thiols (-SH) are polar but not as strongly as -OH or -NH₂. In the examples, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (non-polar) is 0.0, while `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (phenol with -Cl) is 20.23.

2. **Thiol Group Impact**:
   - The -SH group introduces some polarity but is less impactful than -OH or -NH₂. For example, `CC(O)C(C)(C)C` (tertiary alcohol) has 20.23, while `CC1CO1` (epoxide) has 12.53.
   - Since **CCCCS** is a simple aliphatic thiol without additional polar groups, its property value is likely **low but non-zero**.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Similar small polar molecules (e.g., `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` with 46.0, `CC1CO1` with 12.53) suggest that **CCCCS** would have a value in the lower range.
   - No exact thiol examples are provided, but analogous trends suggest a value around **12-20**.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCCS**: **12.53**  
*(This is based on the closest analogy to small polar molecules like `CC1CO1` (epoxide), which has a similar size and moderate polarity.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Zero Property**: 
   - Molecules with **no polar functional groups** (e.g., pure hydrocarbons like **CCC(C)(C)C**, **Clc1ccccc1**, **BrC(Br)Br**) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**) also often have **0.0** unless paired with polar groups.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: 
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** → **20.23**
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** → **20.23**
     - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** → **20.23**
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** → **20.23**
     - **Cc1cccc(O)c1** → **20.23**
     - The presence of **-OH** consistently gives a value of **~20.23** unless other polar groups are present.

3. **Ethers (-O-)**: 
   - **CCCCOC** → **9.23**
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl** → **9.23**
   - Ethers alone seem to give a lower value (~9.23) compared to -OH.

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - More complex polar groups (e.g., nitro, amide, sulfonamide) increase the property value significantly (e.g., **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl** → **118.36**).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- The molecule is a branched hydrocarbon with a **terminal hydroxyl group (-OH)**.
- It closely resembles **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = **20.23**) and **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property = **20.23**), which are also branched alkanes with a single -OH group.
- No other polar functional groups are present, so the property should align with these examples.

### Predicted Property:
**20.23** (same as other branched alkanes with a single -OH group).

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Molecules with only carbon and hydrogen (pure hydrocarbons) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. Examples include:
   - `c1ccccc1` (benzene),
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (a substituted benzene),
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` (another substituted benzene),
   - `C1Cc2ccccc2C1` (a bicyclic hydrocarbon).

2. Molecules with heteroatoms (like O, N, S, halogens) or functional groups (like nitro, carbonyl, etc.) tend to have non-zero property values. Examples include:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) → 43.14,
   - `CCC(=O)C` (a ketone) → 17.07,
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (a urea derivative) → 23.55.

3. The molecule `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is a **naphthalene derivative** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene), which is a pure hydrocarbon with no heteroatoms or functional groups. 

Given the consistent trend that pure hydrocarbons have a property value of **0.0**, the predicted property value for `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is:

### Predicted property value: **0.0**

Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 75.27000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Molecules like **CC(C)C**, **ClCCl**, **CCSSCC**, and **CCCCCCCCCCCCCC** have a property value of **0.0**, indicating that purely hydrophobic/aliphatic or simple halogenated structures contribute little to the property.
   
2. **Polar/Aromatic Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**) have higher values (e.g., **75.27**). 
   - The presence of **amide (NC=O)**, **carbonyl (C=O)**, and **double bonds (C=C)** increases the property value significantly.

3. **Substitution Patterns**:
   - Adding bulky or polar substituents (e.g., **C(C)CCC**) to a core structure (like the hydantoin ring here) tends to moderately increase the property value compared to simpler analogs.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The given molecule is a derivative of hydantoin (a cyclic diurea) with:
- Two **amide (NC=O)** groups in a 5-membered ring (similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**, which has a value of **75.27**).
- A **C=C double bond** (similar to the reference molecule).
- A **bulky substituent (C(C)CCC)** replacing the simpler **methyl (C)** group in the reference.

The bulky substituent (**C(C)CCC**) is more hydrophobic but also adds steric bulk, which may slightly reduce the property compared to the reference. However, the core polar groups dominate.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (75.27)** but with a slightly less polar substituent, the predicted value would be **slightly lower**. 

**Final Prediction: ~70.0**  
(Approximate due to lack of exact matches, but likely in the **70-75** range based on structural analogs.)  

For precision, I'd estimate **72.5** as a balanced value. However, since the reference with a simpler substituent is **75.27**, and the substituent here is less polar but bulkier, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted Property: 73.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, etc.—this is based on the trend in the given data where polar/cyclic amide structures have high values.)  

Would you like to refine this further with additional context?

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of functional groups that can participate in dipole-dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding. The property value is **0.0** for non-polar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halogens without polar groups, or symmetric structures), while polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, ester, amide, phosphate, etc.) increase the value.

For the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene):
1. The **CF3 group** is highly electronegative but does not participate in hydrogen bonding (no H-bond donors/acceptors beyond weak dipole interactions).  
2. The **benzene ring** is non-polar.  
3. The molecule lacks any strong polar or H-bonding functional groups (like OH, COOH, etc.).  

Comparing to similar examples:
- **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (halogenated benzene, no polar groups) → **0.0**  
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (perchlorinated biphenyl) → **0.0**  
- **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (alkyl-substituted benzene) → **0.0**  

The **CF3 group** alone (without additional polar/H-bonding features) does not seem to contribute enough to raise the property value above **0.0** in the given dataset.  

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 110.38000000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the given examples and the structure of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, I can predict its property by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule is a sugar-like polyol with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and an ether linkage (cyclic structure). This is similar to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (property = 121.38), which is a linear polyol (sugar alcohol like sorbitol or mannitol). 
2. **Cyclic vs. Linear**: The given molecule is a cyclic version (likely a pyranose or furanose form of a sugar), while the example is linear. Cyclic structures often have slightly lower values for properties like solubility or polar surface area compared to their linear counterparts, but the effect is not drastic for this property.
3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: The high number of -OH groups (5 in this case, similar to the linear example) suggests strong hydrogen bonding and high polarity, correlating with a high property value.

### Comparison:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (linear, 6 -OH groups): **121.38**
- **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (cyclic, 5 -OH groups): Slightly lower due to reduced flexibility and one fewer -OH, but still very high.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity, the predicted value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is likely close to the linear polyol but slightly lower. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: ~110.0**  

(Note: If the property is something like polar surface area or solubility, the cyclic form would be slightly less than the linear form, but still very high due to the abundance of -OH groups.) 

However, if we consider that the linear form has 6 -OH groups and the cyclic form has 5, the reduction might be proportional. For example, if we assume ~20 units per -OH group (approximate trend from the data), the cyclic form would be around **100-110**. 

Given the examples, I'd refine the prediction to:  
**Predicted Property: 105.0**  

But since the linear form is 121.38, and the cyclic form is slightly less, a more precise estimate is:  
**Final Predicted Property: 115.0**  

(Exact values depend on the property, but this is a reasonable interpolation.)  

**Answer: 115.0**  

(If the property is polar surface area, this aligns well with the trend.)  

---

**Correction**: Looking back at the examples, the linear **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** is 121.38, and the cyclic form here has one less -OH but similar polarity. A safer estimate is slightly lower, e.g., **110.0**.  

**Final Answer: 110.0**

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 100.90000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule contains a multi-ring steroid-like structure (similar to some of the examples, e.g., `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`, which has a property value of **37.3**). This suggests the property is likely influenced by the rigid, hydrophobic core with polar substituents.
2. **Polar functional groups**:
   - Two ketone groups (`C=O`).
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`C(O)`).
   - An ester group (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`).
   These polar groups will increase the property value significantly, as seen in other examples with multiple polar groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **121.38** due to its high polarity).
3. **Conjugated system**: The `C=CC=C` fragment suggests some conjugation, but this is less impactful than the polar groups.
4. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and complex, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O` with **202.32**, though this is an extreme case with many hydroxyls).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The steroid-like core with polar groups is most similar to:
  - `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (**37.3**), but our molecule has additional polar groups (ester and extra hydroxyls).
  - `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (**43.37**), which also has an ester and ketone but fewer hydroxyls.
  - The extra hydroxyls and ketones in our molecule will push the value higher than these examples.

### Predicted property:
Given the steroid core, multiple polar groups (ester, ketones, hydroxyls), and size, the property value is likely in the range of **50-60**. A reasonable estimate is **55.0**, balancing the contributions from the polar groups and the hydrophobic core.

**Final predicted property value: 55.0**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 37.3
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Hydrophilic Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **hydroxyl (-OH)**, **carbonyl (C=O)**, **amide (N-C=O)**, or **ester (COOR)** groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., 20.23, 40.46, 66.48, etc.).
   - Example:  
     - **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (40.46) has two -OH groups.  
     - **O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1** (75.27) has multiple carbonyl/amide groups.

2. **Hydrophobic/Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with purely **aromatic rings** or **nonpolar aliphatic chains** (e.g., **Brc1ccccc1**, **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Mixed Features**: 
   - Molecules with both polar and nonpolar regions (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O**, 40.46) have intermediate values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule has the structure:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**

- **Functional Groups**:  
  - **1 carbonyl (C=O)** group (from **CC(=O)**).  
  - **1 hydroxyl (-OH)** group (from **CCC4O**).  
  - The rest is a **steroidal/aliphatic framework** (largely hydrophobic).

- **Comparison to Examples**:  
  - Very similar to **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = 40.46), which also has a steroidal backbone with -OH groups.  
  - The additional **C=O** group in the target molecule may slightly increase the property value, but the overall hydrophobic framework limits it.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around **40.46**, and accounting for the slight increase due to the carbonyl group, the predicted value is:  
**40.46** (same as the closest analog in the examples).

### Final Answer:
**40.46**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 72.24000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: The **CC(=O)N** fragment is an acetamide group, which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as a donor and acceptor).
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: The **N(=O)=O** group is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.
   - **Aromatic ring**: The **c1ccc(cc1)** is a benzene ring, which is hydrophobic but can interact via π-stacking or polar interactions if substituted with polar groups.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (26.3)**: Contains a polar aldehyde and methoxy group on a benzene ring.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (52.37)**: Contains a nitro group and methoxy group on a benzene ring.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (43.14)**: Nitrobenzene, with just a nitro group on a benzene ring.
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2 (90.06)**: Contains a nitro group, amide, and aromatic rings.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of both an acetamide and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, similar to the examples with nitro and polar substituents.
   - The property values for nitro-containing aromatic compounds range from **43.14** (nitrobenzene) to **52.37** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) and higher when additional polar groups (like amides) are present (e.g., **90.06** for the more complex amide-nitro compound).

### Prediction:
Given that **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has:
- An acetamide group (more polar than a methoxy group) and a nitro group, its property value should be higher than **52.37** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) but lower than **90.06** (more complex amide-nitro compound). 
- The closest analog is **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (52.37)**, but the acetamide group is more polar than the methoxy group, so the value should be higher.

A reasonable estimate is **~60-70**. Looking at other examples with amides and nitro groups:
- **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 (32.34)**: Less polar due to aliphatic chain.
- **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2 (90.06)**: More complex, higher value.

Given the balance, a plausible prediction is **~65.0**.

### Final Answer:
**65.0**

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 53.6
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -CN, -NO₂, -NH, -S=O, etc.) tend to have higher property values. Examples:
   - **OCc1ccccc1 (20.23)**: Phenol-like with -OH.
   - **CC#N (23.79)**: Nitrile group.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (86.28)**: Two nitro groups.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (75.27)**: Multiple carbonyl and amide groups.

2. **Non-Polar or Symmetric Molecules**: Molecules with no polar groups (e.g., pure hydrocarbons, halogens without polar substituents) tend to have **0.0**. Examples:
   - **Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13 (0.0)**: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.0)**: Chlorinated aromatic with no polar groups.
   - **CSSC (0.0)**: Disulfide (non-polar).

3. **Intermediate Values**: Molecules with moderate polarity (e.g., esters, ethers, single polar groups) have values between 20-60. Examples:
   - **CCCC(=O)OC (26.3)**: Ester.
   - **COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3 (84.08)**: Complex polar groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**  
This molecule has:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Highly polar, similar to phosphate esters (which are polar).
2. **Thiocarbamate (SCn1c(=O)oc2...)**: Contains -S- and -C=O, contributing to polarity.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc)**: Adds some polarity but less than the P=S and C=O groups.
4. **Ether linkages (OCC)**: Moderate polarity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (75.27)** or **COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3 (84.08)**). 
- The presence of **P=S** (similar in polarity to P=O) and **C=O** suggests a high property value, likely in the **75-85 range**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong polarity from P=S, C=O, and S-C linkages, the predicted value is **~80.0**. 

However, looking at the examples, the highest values are for nitro groups (86.28) or multiple carbonyls (75-85). Since this molecule lacks nitro groups but has P=S and C=O, a reasonable estimate is **~75.99** (similar to the second example with multiple polar groups).

### Final Answer:
**75.99**
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with the presence of certain functional groups, particularly hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and the overall molecular structure. 

For the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** (which is tert-butanol, a tertiary alcohol with the structure (CH₃)₃C-OH), we can observe the following:

1. **Hydroxyl (-OH) group presence**: Many molecules with an -OH group have a property value of **20.23** (e.g., CCCCCCC(C)O, CC(C)CO, CCCCC(CC)CO, etc.). This suggests that the -OH group is a strong contributor to this value.
2. **Tertiary vs. primary/secondary alcohols**: The property value does not seem to change significantly based on whether the alcohol is primary, secondary, or tertiary, as long as the -OH group is present. For example, CC(C)CO (isobutanol, a primary alcohol) and CC(C)CO (tert-butanol, a tertiary alcohol) would likely have the same value.
3. **No other functional groups**: Since the molecule lacks additional functional groups (like nitro, carbonyl, or halogens), the value is not influenced by other factors.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:

**20.23**

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 74.43
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as hydrogen-bonding capability, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, nitro, etc.). Nonpolar or highly halogenated molecules (e.g., CCl4-like structures, simple hydrocarbons) tend to have a property value of **0.0**, while polar or heterocyclic molecules with hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (e.g., amides, hydroxyls, nitro groups) have higher values.

The molecule in question is:  
**O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**  

This is a **purine-like heterocycle** with multiple hydrogen-bond donors (NH groups) and acceptors (carbonyl and ring nitrogens). Similar molecules in the dataset with such features (e.g., Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F: 71.77, Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1: 71.77) have high property values (~70–75).  

Thus, the predicted property value for this molecule is:  
**71.77**

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)** and **ethers (R-O-R')** often have property values around **20.23** (e.g., CCCCCO, CC(C)O, CCCCCO, CC(C)O).
2. **Esters (R-COO-R')** tend to have higher values, e.g., **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (44.76)**, **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O (91.01)**.
3. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)C, c1ccccc1)** and **halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl)** typically have **0.0**.
4. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** in aldehydes/ketones (e.g., CC(=O)C, COc1ccc(C=O)cc1) often have values around **17.07–26.3**.
5. The presence of **nitrogen** or **polar functional groups** (e.g., amides, nitro groups) tends to increase the property value significantly.

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is an **ester (methyl acetate-like structure)** with the formula **CH3-COO-CH(CH3)**.
- Esters in the examples have property values ranging from **44.76** (for a phosphate ester) to **91.01** (for a complex ester with additional polar groups).
- The given ester is simpler (no additional polar groups), so its value should be closer to the lower end of the ester range but higher than alcohols/ethers (~20.23).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the ester functionality and comparison to similar structures, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**44.76** (matching the phosphate ester example, as simple esters like this one are not directly listed but fall in this range). 

However, if we consider that **CC(=O)OC** (methyl formate, a simpler ester) might be slightly lower, but no exact match exists in the examples, the closest ester example is **44.76**. 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**44.76**

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 41.13
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO, -NO₂) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (phenol with Cl): **20.23**
     - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (benzaldehyde with OH): **37.3**
     - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (nitrophenol): **63.37**
     - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide with aromatic N): **55.98**

2. **Hydrogen Bonding Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO) have very high values:
     - `OCC(O)CO` (glycerol): **60.69**
     - `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (sugar-like): **110.38**

3. **Non-Polar or Symmetric Molecules**:
   - Molecules with no polar groups or symmetric halogens (e.g., `C1CCCCC1`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) have **0.0**.

4. **Amides and Ureas**:
   - Amides (e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1`): **38.33**
   - Ureas (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`): **61.44**

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a **urea derivative** with two aromatic rings attached to the urea group (-N-C(=O)-N-). 

Key features:
- The urea group is highly polar with two hydrogen bond donors (NH) and one hydrogen bond acceptor (C=O).
- Two aromatic rings add some hydrophobicity but do not dominate over the urea's polarity.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (amide with aromatic ring): **38.33**
2. `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea): **61.44**
3. `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (aromatic amide): **55.98**

The target molecule is a **diaryl urea**, which is more polar than simple amides but less polar than cyclic ureas (due to less constrained hydrogen bonding). 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong hydrogen bonding capability of the urea group and the aromatic contributions, a reasonable estimate is **~55-60**. 

A precise prediction based on the examples is **58.5**. 

However, looking at the closest analogs:
- The cyclic urea (61.44) is slightly higher due to rigidity.
- The aromatic amide (55.98) is slightly lower.

Thus, the predicted value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is **58.5**. 

(Note: If the property is something like "aqueous solubility in mg/L" or "hydrogen bond acceptor count," the value would differ, but based on the given examples, this is the most consistent estimate.) 

### Final Answer:
**58.5**

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). The structure is fully aromatic and planar, with no polar functional groups or heteroatoms (like O, N, S, or halogens).

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Fully aromatic hydrocarbons without polar groups tend to have a property value of 0.0**:
   - Examples: 
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (fully fused polyaromatic, value = 0.0)
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (chlorinated aromatic, but still = 0.0)
     - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene derivative, but no polar groups, value = 0.0)
     - `Brc1ccccc1` (bromobenzene, value = 0.0)
     - `CCCc1ccccc1` (alkyl-substituted benzene, value = 0.0)
     - `C1C=CCC=C1` (non-aromatic cyclic, value = 0.0)

2. **Polar or heteroatom-containing groups increase the property value**:
   - For example, molecules with amides, esters, nitro groups, or halogens (when combined with polar groups) have higher values.

### Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13):
- No heteroatoms (only C and H).
- No polar functional groups (like -OH, -NH2, -COOH, etc.).
- Fully conjugated and aromatic, similar to other hydrocarbons with value = 0.0 in the examples.

### Conclusion:
Since fluorene is a purely aromatic hydrocarbon without any polar or heteroatom-containing substituents, its predicted property value is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 122.05999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (e.g., >50)** are associated with molecules containing:
   - Multiple polar functional groups (e.g., sulfonamides, nitro groups, carbonyls, hydroxyls, amines).
   - Conjugated systems with electron-withdrawing/donating groups (e.g., aromatic rings with NO₂, SO₂, or NH₂).
   - Examples:
     - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O (88.37)**: Contains cyclic urea, nitro, and thiazole.
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (92.47)**: Nitro, amide, phenol, and chloro groups.
     - **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O (82.28)**: Sulfonamide, thiazole, and ether.

2. **Low/Zero Property Values (e.g., 0.0)** are seen for:
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, aromatics without polar groups).
   - Simple halides (e.g., C-Cl, C-Br) without additional polar moieties.

3. **Intermediate Values (e.g., 20–50)** often involve:
   - Single polar groups (e.g., OH, NH₂, esters) or limited conjugation.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**  
- Contains:
  1. A **sulfonamide group (SO₂NH)**, which is highly polar and often associated with high property values (e.g., 63.84 for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**).
  2. A **guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N)**, which is very polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
  3. An **aromatic ring with an amine (NH₂)**, adding polarity and conjugation.
  4. The **SO₂ and NH groups are conjugated with the aromatic ring**, enhancing electron delocalization and polarity.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12 (46.17)**: Less polar than our molecule (only cyclic imide).
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1 (63.84)**: Sulfur-containing polar group with conjugation.
- **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O (88.37)**: Multiple polar groups (nitro, cyclic urea).

Our molecule has **more polar groups and conjugation** than the 46.17 example but lacks the nitro group of the 88.37 example. It is most similar to sulfonamide-containing molecules with values in the **60–80 range**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong polarity of the sulfonamide, guanidine-like moiety, and aromatic amine, the predicted value is **~75.0**. 

However, looking for closer analogs:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (92.47)** has nitro and amide, but our molecule lacks nitro.
- **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O (82.28)** is a closer match (sulfonamide + heterocycle).

Thus, a refined estimate is **~80.0**. 

### Final Answer:
**80.0** (rounded to match the precision of the given examples).

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 89.51999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be related to molecular weight, solubility, or some other physicochemical property, but given the examples, it seems most consistent with **molecular weight (MW)** in g/mol. Here's the reasoning:

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Small, non-polar molecules (e.g., C1CCOCC1, CCCC=O, CCCC)**: These have low or zero values (e.g., 0.0 or 9.23), suggesting they are lightweight or lack functional groups contributing to the property.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., COc1ccccc1O, c1ccccc1O)**: These have moderate values (~20–30), increasing with additional polar substituents.
3. **Complex molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., steroids, large heterocycles)**: These have high values (e.g., 100.9, 268.68), correlating with their size and polarity.
4. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: These significantly increase the property (e.g., Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has 63.37 vs. phenol at 20.23).
5. **Trifluoromethyl (CF3)**: Adds substantial mass/polarity (e.g., compare Cl-substituted aromatics at 0.0 vs. CF3-containing molecules).

### Given molecule:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**  
- Contains:
  - Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O).
  - A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F).
  - A tertiary amine (CCN(CC)).
  - An alkene (CC(C)=C).
  - An aromatic ring.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (84.6): Has two nitro groups and a complex fused ring system.
- **Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl** (60.91): One nitro-like group and a heterocycle.
- **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (63.37): One nitro group on phenol.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has **two nitro groups** and a **CF3 group**, which will significantly increase the property value. It is less complex than the steroid-like structures (~100.9) but more complex than simple nitroaromatics (~60–85).  

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~84.6** (similar to the molecule with two nitro groups and a fused ring system).  

However, since this molecule has an additional CF3 group (which is heavy/polar) but lacks the fused ring complexity, we might adjust slightly higher.  

**Final prediction: 86.5** (rounded from the closest analogous examples).  

---
**Answer:** The predicted property value is **86.5**.

*Note: If the property is not molecular weight but another metric (e.g., solubility, logP), the reasoning would differ, but the examples strongly suggest MW is the property being predicted.*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)** without polar functional groups (e.g., **C1CCCCCCC1**, **c1ccccc1**, **C=CC=C**) have a property value of **0.0**.
2. **Simple alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CCC(O)CC, OC1CCCCCC1)** consistently have a value of **20.23**.
3. **Aldehydes (R-CHO)**:
   - **CCCC=O** has a value of **17.07**.
   - **O=C1CCCCC1** (cyclic aldehyde) also has **17.07**.
4. **Esters (R-COOR')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has **52.32** (but this includes an aromatic amine, complicating the comparison).
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** has **26.3** (simpler ester).
5. **Ethers (R-O-R')**:
   - **CC(C)SC(C)C** (thioether) has **0.0**, but oxygen ethers are not directly represented in the examples.
6. **Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., polyols like OCC(O)C(O)CO)** have much higher values (e.g., **80.92**).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is an **ester** (specifically, **methyl acetate**-like structure: **isopropyl formate**, **CH3-CH(CH3)-O-CHO**).
- It has:
  - An aldehyde group (**C=O**).
  - An ether linkage (**O**).
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (ester) has **26.3**.
  - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (branched ester) has **26.3**.
  - **CCCC=O** (aldehyde) has **17.07**.
- The presence of the **ester group (OC=O)** suggests a higher value than a simple aldehyde but similar to other simple esters.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O (26.3)** and **CCCCCOC(=O)C (26.3)**, the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely:

**26.3**
==================================================
Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophilicity/Polarity**: The property seems to correlate with the presence of polar or hydrophilic groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH, -NO2, -NH2, -SO3H, etc.). Molecules with multiple polar groups tend to have higher values.
   - Example: `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (3 -OH groups + ester) → **86.99**.
   - Example: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C` (multiple amide groups) → **75.27**.
   - Example: `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (5 -OH groups) → **121.38**.

2. **Nonpolar/Hydrophobic Molecules**: Molecules with no polar groups (e.g., pure hydrocarbons, halogens without polar substituents) tend to have **0.0**.
   - Example: `CC(C)C` (isobutane) → **0.0**.
   - Example: `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) → **0.0**.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (chlorinated biphenyl) → **0.0**.

3. **Single Polar Group**: Molecules with one polar group (e.g., -OH, -OCH3, -Br) tend to have intermediate values.
   - Example: `O=Cc1ccccc1` (benzaldehyde) → **17.07**.
   - Example: `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) → **20.23**.
   - Example: `CO` (methanol) → **20.23**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, which is a methyl-substituted phenol (specifically, 3-methylphenol or m-cresol with an additional methyl group). It has:
- One hydroxyl group (-OH).
- Two methyl groups (-CH3), which are nonpolar.

This is structurally similar to phenol (`c1ccccc1O`, property = **20.23**) but with additional methyl groups. Methyl groups slightly reduce polarity but not drastically.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) → **20.23**.
- `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene, no -OH) → **0.0** (no polar group).
- `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (toluidine, -NH2) → **26.02** (amine is more polar than -OH in this context).

The -OH group dominates the property, so the value should be close to phenol but slightly lower due to the methyl groups' hydrophobic effect.

### Predicted Property:
Given the examples, the most reasonable prediction is **20.23** (same as phenol, as the methyl groups' effect is minor in this context). However, if we consider that methyl groups slightly reduce the property, a value slightly lower than 20.23 (e.g., ~17-20) might also be plausible. But the closest match in the examples is **20.23**.

### Final Answer:
**20.23**

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 27.69
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphate/Thiophosphate Esters (P(=S)(OR)OR')**:
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment (or similar) tend to have property values around **27.69** when attached to aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, I). Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → 27.69
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → 27.69
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → 27.69
   - The presence of halogens on the aromatic ring seems consistent for this value.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Non-Halogen Substituents**:
   - When the aromatic ring has non-halogen substituents (e.g., alkyl, alkoxy, thioether), the property value may differ. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` → 20.23 (no halogens, but hydroxyl and methyl groups)
     - `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` → 20.23 (similar to above)
     - `Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1` → Not in examples, but structurally similar to the above with a thioether (SC) group.

3. **Thioether (SC) Substituent**:
   - The given molecule has a **thioether (SC)** group on the aromatic ring. None of the phosphate ester examples include this, but other molecules with thioethers or sulfides (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` → 86.18) have higher values. However, this is a sulfonamide, not directly comparable.
   - Simpler thioethers (e.g., `SC`) are not present in the examples, but alkyl/aryl thioethers might not significantly increase the property value beyond the phosphate ester baseline.

4. **Methyl Substituent (C)**:
   - Methyl groups on aromatic rings (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` → 20.23) do not seem to increase the property value beyond the base phosphate ester value when halogens are absent.

### Prediction:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has:
- A **phosphate/thiophosphate ester** core (COP(=S)(OC)O), which typically gives ~27.69 when attached to halogenated aromatics.
- An aromatic ring with a **thioether (SC)** and a **methyl (C)** substituent (no halogens).

Since the aromatic ring lacks halogens but has a thioether, the property value is likely **lower than 27.69** but higher than simple alkyl/alkoxy-substituted aromatics (e.g., 20.23). A reasonable estimate is slightly below the halogenated phosphate ester value, perhaps in the **20-25 range**. 

Given the examples, the closest match is **20.23**, which appears frequently for non-halogenated aromatic systems with hydroxyl or alkoxy groups. The thioether might not drastically alter this.

### Final Prediction:
**20.23**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatic systems** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain other functional groups (e.g., NO₂, SO₂, etc.). Examples:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0**
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` → **0.0**
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0**

2. The presence of **polar or ionizable groups** (e.g., NO₂, SO₂NH, OH, COOH, etc.) increases the property value significantly. Examples:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O` → **109.49** (due to SO₂NH and OH)
   - `CN(=O)=O` → **43.14** (due to NO₂)

3. **Fully halogenated non-polar aromatics/aliphatics** consistently show **0.0**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with:
- No polar or ionizable groups (only Cl substituents).
- Symmetrical, highly halogenated aromatic rings.

This matches the examples where similar structures (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0** (due to the absence of polar/ionizable groups and high halogenation).
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 43.14
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value tends to be non-zero when the molecule contains certain functional groups or structural features, such as:

1. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. Multiple polar or electronegative atoms (O, N, halogens)
4. Complex or extended conjugated systems

Molecules with simple aliphatic chains, pure hydrocarbons, or single halogen substitutions tend to have a property value of 0.0.

For the molecule CCCN(=O)=O:
- It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is a strongly polar and electron-withdrawing functional group
- The nitro group is attached to a short aliphatic chain (propyl group)

Looking at similar examples:
- O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (three nitro groups) has 129.42
- N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (two nitrile groups) has 47.58
- Nc1ccccc1O (amino and hydroxyl) has 46.25

Given that our molecule has one nitro group on a small aliphatic chain (less conjugated than aromatic examples), a reasonable estimate would be between the simple aliphatic compounds (0.0) and the aromatic nitro compounds. 

The closest analog is probably Nc1ccccc1O (46.25), but with one less aromatic ring and one less polar group. Considering the strong effect of the nitro group but the small size of the molecule, I would predict a value around:

**46.25** (same as Nc1ccccc1O, as the nitro group's effect may compensate for the lack of aromaticity compared to the aniline phenol)

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, BrC(Br)Br) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups beyond halogens (Cl, Br) and simple alkyl/aryl substitutions.
   
2. The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a **monosubstituted benzene with fluorine and bromine** but no other functional groups (e.g., no -OH, -NO2, -CO, -NH2, etc.). This is structurally similar to the examples with property values of **0.0**.

3. The presence of halogens alone (without polar or ionizable groups) does not appear to contribute to a non-zero property value in the given dataset. For example:
   - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 0.0  
   - BrC(Br)Br → 0.0  
   - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl → 0.0  

4. Non-zero values are associated with more complex functional groups (e.g., -NO2, -CO, -NH2, -OH, esters, amides, etc.), as seen in molecules like:
   - NC(=O)N → 69.11 (urea, highly polar)  
   - O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1 → 75.27 (cyclic imide)  
   - Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O → 43.14 (nitro group)  

### Conclusion:
Since **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a simple halogenated aromatic compound with no additional functional groups, its property value is predicted to be **0.0**, consistent with similar examples in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Framework**: The molecule is a bicyclic structure with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one of the rings. It has two quaternary carbons (fully substituted carbons, denoted as C(C)(C)(C)) and a rigid, saturated hydrocarbon backbone.
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Hydroxyl group (-OH), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - No other heteroatoms (like N, S, or halogens) or highly polar groups (like carbonyls or sulfonamides) are present.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is moderately sized (similar to some steroids or terpenes in the examples) but lacks extended conjugation or highly polar substituents.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Similar Molecules**:
  - **CC(C)(C)CO** (property = 20.23): A simple tertiary alcohol with a small hydrocarbon tail. The hydroxyl group dominates the property.
  - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (property = 93.06): A complex steroid-like molecule with multiple polar groups (hydroxyl, carbonyl, fluorine). The high value is due to the cumulative effect of these groups.
  - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property = 35.53): A bicyclic system with a carbonyl and aromatic ether. The property is higher due to the carbonyl and aromaticity.
  - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 37.3): A steroid-like molecule with a hydroxyl and carbonyl group. The property is elevated due to these polar groups.

- **Key Observations**:
  - The presence of a hydroxyl group alone (without other polar groups) typically gives a property value in the ~20 range (e.g., CC(C)(C)CO = 20.23).
  - Rigid bicyclic structures with hydroxyl groups but no other polar features tend to have slightly higher values than simple alcohols, likely due to reduced flexibility and increased effective polarity.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** has a hydroxyl group and a rigid bicyclic framework but lacks other polar or conjugated features. Its property value should be slightly higher than a simple tertiary alcohol (like CC(C)(C)CO = 20.23) but lower than molecules with additional polar groups (e.g., carbonyls or halogens).

A reasonable estimate is **~25-30**. Given the examples, a value close to **26.3** (seen for molecules like CCOC(=O)C or CC(C)COC=O) seems plausible, but since this molecule lacks a carbonyl, a slightly lower value is more appropriate. 

However, the rigid bicyclic structure may compensate for the lack of additional polar groups, so I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 28.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that hydroxyl groups + rigid frameworks yield values in this range.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 55.84
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CC=CC1), fully halogenated structures (e.g., ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl), or symmetric aromatic systems (e.g., c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1) tend to have a property value of 0.0. These lack polar or functional groups that could contribute to the property.

2. **Intermediate Property Values (20-80)**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, hydroxyl groups, amines, or heterocycles) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol with Cl substituent) = 20.23
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** (complex polar structure) = 80.37
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C** (cyclic urea derivative) = 75.27

3. **High Property Values (>100)**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar/ionic groups or extended conjugation (e.g., **OCC(NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)C(O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** = 112.7).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**. Its structure includes:
- A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)** – polar and bulky.
- A **cyclic amide (lactam) group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)** – polar and aromatic.
- The molecule resembles **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 55.84), but with a slightly simpler structure (no thioether or chloroalkyl group).

### Comparison:
- The phosphorothioate and lactam groups are highly polar, similar to the example with property = 55.84.
- The absence of the thioether (S) and chloroalkyl (CCl) groups may slightly reduce the property value compared to 55.84, but the core polar features remain.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity and the influence of polar groups, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is approximately **50.0**. 

However, since the closest example is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (55.84), and the target molecule is slightly less polar (no S or Cl), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 52.0** (rounded to match the precision of the given examples). 

This aligns with the trend where molecules with similar polar/heteroatom-rich structures fall in the 50-60 range.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 26.93
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **uracil-like** core with a **cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1** framework. This resembles heterocyclic systems with conjugated carbonyl groups (e.g., imides or lactams), which often exhibit higher property values due to polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.
   - Example: **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** has a similar imide motif and a value of **75.27**.
   - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** also has a similar structure and the same value (**75.27**).

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has:
   - A **methyl group (C)** attached to the nitrogen (n1C).
   - A **phenyl ring (c2ccccc2)** attached to the other nitrogen.
   - A **carbonyl group (C=O)** conjugated with the heterocycle, increasing polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **imide-like structures (C(=O)N-C(=O)N)** or **lactams** tend to have high values (e.g., **75.27**).
   - The presence of **aromatic rings** (e.g., phenyl) attached to polar cores can further stabilize the structure but may not drastically change the property if the core dominates.
   - The **methyl groups** are non-polar and minimally affect the property.

4. **Closest Matches**:
   - **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (75.27): Very similar imide core + aromatic ring.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (75.27): Same core with aliphatic substituents.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (23.55): Simpler diamide, lower due to lack of conjugation/aromaticity.

### Deviations from Examples:
- The molecule lacks the **second carbonyl in the ring** (unlike the imides with 75.27), but the **C=O and N-phenyl** groups still confer significant polarity.
- It is not as polar as **sulfonamides** or **multiple conjugated carbonyls** (e.g., **99.6** or **133.75**).

### Prediction:
Given the **imide-like core with one carbonyl and aromatic substitution**, the property value is likely **close to the imide examples (75.27)** but slightly lower due to the absence of a second carbonyl. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 42.43**  
*(This aligns with examples like O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23 (42.43), which also have a single carbonyl in a heterocycle with aromatic substitution.)*  

However, if the property is more sensitive to the **imide-like character**, it could be higher (e.g., **62.73**, like the thiourea examples). Given the ambiguity, **42.43** is a conservative estimate based on the closest structural match. 

**Final answer: 42.43**

Based on the provided examples, the property being predicted appears to be **water solubility** (likely in mg/mL or similar units), where higher values indicate greater solubility and 0.0 indicates negligible solubility.

### Analysis of the given molecule: **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**  
This is **ethyl hexanoate**, an ester with the structure:  
- A 6-carbon chain (**hexanoate**) with a terminal ester group (**=O)OCC**) attached to an ethyl group (**OCC**).

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1)**: All have **0.0** solubility (hydrophobic).  
2. **Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)N, CC(C)OC(=O)C, CCCCCOC(=O)OC)**:  
   - Esters with small alkyl groups (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**) have moderate solubility (~52.32).  
   - Larger esters (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)OC**) have lower solubility (~26.3).  
3. **Polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -C=O, -N)**: Increase solubility significantly if present in high proportions (e.g., sugars like OCC(O)C(O)CO ~80.92).  

### Prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **medium-sized ester** (6-carbon chain + ethyl group).  
- It lacks additional polar groups (e.g., -OH, -N) that would boost solubility.  
- Comparable examples:  
  - **CCCCCOC(=O)OC** (26.3) is similar in size/structure.  
  - **COC=O** (26.3) is a smaller ester but aligns with the trend.  

### Final Prediction:
The solubility of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is likely **26.3** (same as other esters of similar size in the examples).

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic esters** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` with a value of **26.3**) and similar structures tend to have values in the **20-30 range** when they lack additional polar or functional groups.
2. The presence of a **methyl ester (COC=O)** attached to a phenyl ring (as in this case) is structurally similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl ester of benzoic acid, value = 26.3), but with a **shorter alkyl chain (methoxy instead of ethoxy)**.
3. Shorter alkyl chains (e.g., methyl vs. ethyl) sometimes slightly reduce the property value, but the effect is often small unless other functional groups are involved.
4. Simple aromatic esters without additional substituents (e.g., halogens, hydroxyl, or nitro groups) typically fall in the **20-30 range**.

### Comparison:
- `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate): **26.3**
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, with just one fewer carbon in the ester group. 

Given the minimal difference between methyl and ethyl esters in the examples, the value is likely **close to 26.3**, possibly slightly lower due to the shorter chain. However, no examples of methyl benzoate are provided, so we'll approximate based on the closest analog.

### Predicted Property Value:
**26.3** (same as ethyl benzoate, as the alkyl chain length difference is unlikely to significantly alter the property in this context). 

Thus, the predicted value for `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` is **26.3**.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons without polar substituents) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. 

The molecule in question, **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), is a simple hydrocarbon with no polar functional groups or heteroatoms. It is structurally similar to other molecules in the dataset with a value of 0.0, such as:
- **CC/C=C/C** (0.0)  
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (0.0)  
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (0.0)  

Thus, the predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional group presence. Molecules with highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines, or multiple electronegative atoms) tend to have higher values, while nonpolar or symmetrically halogenated molecules (e.g., fully substituted halogens, aromatic hydrocarbons) tend to have a value of **0.0**.

For the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane):
1. It is a fully halogenated compound with no polarizable hydrogens or functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding.
2. The symmetry and lack of dipole moment (due to the three bromines canceling out any net polarity) make it nonpolar.
3. This is analogous to other fully halogenated or symmetric nonpolar molecules in the examples (e.g., CCl₃CCl₃, C₆H₅Br, C₁₀H₈), which all have a property value of **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 55.84
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of molecular polarizability), given the values and trends observed in the examples.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: Present in some examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** with a value of **38.77**). This group contributes significantly to polarizability.
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many examples, typically contributing ~20-30 units unless heavily substituted.
3. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: Similar to cyclic amides in the examples (e.g., **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** with **66.48**), which add substantial polarizability.
4. **Chlorine (CCl)**: Halogens like Cl add modestly (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has **0.0**, but when combined with polar groups, they contribute more).
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP)**: Ether linkages (e.g., **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has **52.37**) add moderate polarizability.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: **38.77**) but has an additional lactam ring and more complex structure.
- The lactam contribution is similar to **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (value: **66.48**), but the rest of the molecule is less polarizable than that example.

### Estimated value:
Given the combined contributions:
- Phosphorothioate + aromatic + lactam + chloroalkyl ≈ **~50-70** range.
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (38.77)**, but with the added lactam, the value should be higher.

### Final prediction:
**Predicted property value: 58.2**  
*(This aligns with similar structures like **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F**, which has a value of **58.2** and shares features like aromaticity, halogens, and amide groups.)*

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 80.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, amides, halogens, heterocycles, etc.).

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Tertiary amide group**: **CN(C)C(=O)N** – Similar to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property = 23.55) but with an additional aromatic substitution.
2. **Chlorinated aromatic ring**: **c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)** – Chlorine substitution on an aromatic ring (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a property of 43.14).
3. **Heterocyclic group**: **n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** – A fused heterocycle with a carbonyl group and bulky tert-butyl substitution. This resembles complex heterocycles in the examples (e.g., **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23** has a property of 30.19).
4. **Polar and conjugated system**: The molecule has significant polarity due to the amide, chlorine, and heterocyclic carbonyl.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (simpler amide): 23.55  
- **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (aromatic amine + fused ring): 26.02  
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (chloro-nitro aromatic): 43.14  
- **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23** (complex heterocycle): 30.19  
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (thiourea + aromatic): 38.05  

Given the combination of a tertiary amide, chloro-aromatic, and a complex heterocycle with a carbonyl, the property value is likely higher than simpler amides but not as extreme as nitro-containing compounds (e.g., 69.16 or 86.28). 

### Predicted property:
A reasonable estimate is **~58.2**, similar to **CCCC(C)C1(CC)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O** (58.2), which also has a complex polar structure with amide and heterocyclic features.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 29.46
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core**: The molecule contains two phenol-like aromatic rings (with -OH groups) connected by an ether linkage (O). Phenol derivatives in the examples (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**) have a property value of **20.23**.
2. **Chlorine substitutions**: The molecule has multiple Cl substitutions (3 Cl atoms total). Cl substitutions often appear in molecules with property values of **20.23** (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**, **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**).
3. **Symmetry and size**: The molecule is symmetric and larger than simple phenol derivatives, but the examples show that larger symmetric molecules with similar functional groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) retain the **20.23** value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: 20.23 (phenol + 2 Cl)
- **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: 20.23 (phenol + 4 Cl)
- **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**: This is structurally similar to the above but with two phenol-ether-linked rings and 3 Cl atoms. The ether linkage and additional ring do not seem to significantly alter the property in other examples (e.g., **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** has 37.3, but this has an aldehyde, which is more polar).

### Conclusion:
The property value is likely **20.23**, as the Cl and OH substitutions dominate the trend, and the ether linkage does not appear to introduce a significant deviation in the given examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**20.23**

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property being predicted appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and electronic structure). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Alkanes and purely hydrocarbon structures** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCC`, `C1CCc2ccccc2C1`, `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`) have a property value of **0.0**, indicating minimal polarizability or no significant contribution to refractivity beyond simple hydrocarbons.
2. **Molecules with double bonds but no heteroatoms or functional groups** (e.g., `CC/C=C/C`) also have a value of **0.0**, as seen in the example `CC/C=C/C` in the dataset.
3. The presence of heteroatoms (O, N, Cl, etc.), carbonyl groups (`C=O`), or conjugated systems increases the property value significantly.

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C` (a trans-butene derivative, structurally equivalent to `CC/C=C/C` in the examples). Since this is a simple hydrocarbon with a double bond but no heteroatoms or functional groups, its property value is **0.0**, consistent with the examples.

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 9.23
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to be related to **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and functional groups). Here are the key observations:

1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, simple aromatics)** without polar groups (e.g., `CC#C`, `C1CCCCCC1`, `Cc1cccc(C)c1`) have a property value of **0.0**.
2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups** (e.g., alcohols, ethers, carbonyls) increase the value:
   - Simple alcohols/ethers (e.g., `CC(C)O`, `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1`) have values around **20.23**.
   - More complex oxygenated structures (e.g., esters, multiple OH groups) yield higher values (e.g., `CC(C)COC(=O)C` = 26.3).
3. **Halogens** (Cl, Br, F) generally do not contribute significantly unless combined with polar groups (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 0.0).
4. **Nitrogen-containing groups** (e.g., amides, nitro groups, heterocycles) substantially increase the value (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` = 75.27).

### Prediction for `CCCOCC`:
- This is a **symmetrical ether** (`C3H7-O-C3H7`, dipropyl ether), structurally similar to other ethers/alcohols in the dataset (e.g., `CC(C)O` = 20.23, `CCC(O)CC` = 20.23).
- Ethers and alcohols with comparable carbon numbers have values around **20.23**.
- No additional polar or conjugated groups are present to increase the value further.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 32.34
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar or hydrophilic groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -CN, -CO, -SO₂, -N=O, -F, -Cl, -Br) tend to have higher property values.
   - Molecules with purely hydrophobic/aliphatic or aromatic structures (e.g., long alkyl chains, simple aromatics like benzene rings without polar substituents) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

2. **Hybrid Structures**:
   - Molecules with both hydrophobic (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings) and hydrophilic groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -CO) have intermediate property values. For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)CC(=O)OCC** (ester and ether groups) has a value of **52.6**.
     - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (amide, ether, and aromatic rings) has a value of **42.43**.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with polar groups (e.g., -NO₂, -CN, -OH, halogens) increase the property value. For example:
     - **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups and a hydroxyl) has a value of **106.51**.
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (one nitro group) has a value of **43.14**.

4. **Amides and Ureas**:
   - Amide groups (-CONH-) tend to contribute significantly to the property value. For example:
     - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (amide with hydrophobic groups) has a value of **32.34**.
     - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (amide with ether and aromatic) has a value of **38.33**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**. Its structure includes:
- Two aromatic rings (hydrophobic).
- A tertiary amide group (-CON(C)(C)-), which is polar.
- A dimethyl-substituted amide nitrogen (further increasing hydrophobicity but balanced by the polar amide).

This structure is similar to:
- **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 42.43), which has an amide, aromatic rings, and a polar ether/thiazole group.
- **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property = 32.34), which has an amide and hydrophobic aliphatic rings.

The target molecule has more hydrophobic character (two aromatic rings and a bulky tert-butyl-like group) but retains the polar amide. Thus, its value should be slightly lower than **42.43** but higher than **32.34**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**38.33** (similar to **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1**, which also has an amide and aromatic rings).

### Final Answer:
**38.33**
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 29.1
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**: 0.0 (halogen substituents only)
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 0.0 (halogen substituents only)
   - **c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1**: 0.0 (multiple halogens)
   - **ClCc1ccccc1**: 0.0 (halogen on aliphatic side chain)
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 20.23 (phenol with bromine)
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: 0.0 (alkyl substituents only)
   - **Cc1ccc(O)cc1C**: 20.23 (alkyl and hydroxyl substituents)

2. **Amide or Nitrogen-Containing Groups**:
   - **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 32.34 (tertiary amide with aromatic rings)
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**: 61.44 (cyclic amide/urea)
   - **CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1**: 62.73 (complex nitrogen heterocycle)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 20.31 (tertiary amide with aromatic rings)

3. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 20.23 (phenol with bromine)
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**: 0.0 (bromine and fluorine)
   - **c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1**: 0.0 (multiple bromines)

4. **Acetanilide-Like Structures**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1**: Not explicitly in the examples, but similar to **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (20.31) and **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (32.34). The presence of an amide (N-C=O) attached to an aromatic ring tends to give values in the 20-35 range unless other polar groups are present.

### Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- This is an **acetanilide derivative** with a **bromine substituent** on the aromatic ring.
- The amide group (**CC(=O)N-**) is polar and contributes to a higher property value (similar to other amides in the examples, which range from 20.31 to 32.34).
- The bromine substituent alone does not drastically increase the value (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** is 20.23, same as phenol without bromine).
- No other polar or ionizable groups are present.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, the closest analogs are:
- **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 20.31 (amide + aromatic)
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 20.23 (phenol + bromine)
- **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 32.34 (more complex amide)

Since **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is simpler than the tertiary amides but has a polar amide group, the value is likely in the **20-30 range**, similar to **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (20.31). The bromine does not significantly alter this.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**26.02**  
*(This matches **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (26.02), which also has a nitrogen substituent on an aromatic ring, though not an amide. The amide group's polarity is roughly balanced by the bromine's lack of additional contribution.)*

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the property in question is likely related to **water solubility** or **logP (partition coefficient)**, where higher values indicate greater solubility or polarity, and a value of 0.0 typically indicates very low solubility or non-polarity.

Key observations:
1. **Aromatic rings without polar groups** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1`, `CCCC=C`, `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**, indicating they are non-polar/hydrophobic.
2. **Aliphatic chains without polar groups** (e.g., `CC1CCCCC1`, `CCC=C`) also have a value of **0.0**.
3. **Presence of polar groups (e.g., -OH, -CO, -NO2, -NH2)** increases the property value significantly (e.g., `CC(C)CO` = 20.23, `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = 63.37).
4. **Branched aliphatic chains with polar groups** (e.g., `CC(C)CCO`, `CC(C)CCCO`) consistently have a value of **20.23**.

The molecule in question is **`CC(C)Cc1ccccc1`**:
- It has a branched aliphatic chain (`CC(C)C-`) attached to a benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`).
- There are **no polar functional groups**; the benzene ring and alkyl group are both hydrophobic.
- Similar molecules like `Cc1ccccc1`, `CCc1ccc(C)cc1`, and `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` all have a property value of **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **`CC(C)Cc1ccccc1`** is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 17.07
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Aromatic Hydrocarbons**: 
   - Molecules like **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthalene derivative) and **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polycyclic aromatic) have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that pure aromatic systems without polar or functional groups tend to have low or zero property values.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-NO2**, **-CO**, **-NH**, **halogens**) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **63.32**
     - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): **86.28**
     - **Fc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O** (fluorouracil): **65.72**

3. **Aldehydes and Ketones**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (unsaturated ketone): **17.07**
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (ketone): **17.07**
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): **58.2**
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (**C=O**) seems to contribute moderately to the property value, especially if conjugated with an aromatic ring or other polar groups.

4. **Benzaldehyde Derivatives**:
   - The molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) has a **formyl group (-CHO)** directly attached to a benzene ring. This is similar to:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **63.32**, but benzaldehyde lacks the additional phenol and amide groups.
     - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid ketone): **43.37**, but this is more complex.
   - The formyl group is polar and conjugated with the aromatic ring, which should increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but not as much as nitro or hydroxyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons: **0.0**
- Ketones/aldehydes without additional polar groups: ~**17.07** (e.g., **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1**)
- Benzaldehyde has a conjugated carbonyl (more polar than aliphatic ketones) but no additional strong polar groups, its value should be higher than aliphatic ketones but lower than nitro or hydroxyl-substituted aromatics.

A reasonable estimate is **~30-40**. Looking at similar molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: **32.34** (amide + chloro)
- **c1cncnc1**: **25.78** (polar heterocycle)
- **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: **58.2** (imide, more polar)

Benzaldehyde is less polar than the imide but more polar than simple ketones. A good prediction is **~35.0**.

However, in the examples, **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (unsaturated ketone) is **17.07**, and benzaldehyde is more polar due to conjugation. A closer match is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (**32.34**), but benzaldehyde is slightly less polar. 

Given the trends, the predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is:  
**30.0** (rounded to match the precision of the examples). 

But looking back, **c1cncnc1** (polar heterocycle) is **25.78**, and benzaldehyde is likely higher due to the carbonyl. A more precise estimate is **~28.0**.

After reconsidering, the most consistent prediction is:  
**28.5** (interpolating between simpler ketones and more polar aromatics). 

However, in the absence of an exact match, the closest reasonable value is:  
**30.0** (aligning with mid-range polar aromatics).

True Property: 118.04999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Heterocyclic core**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like ring** (imidazolidine-2,4-dione) with two carbonyl groups (O=C2 and C(=O)N2). This is a polar and hydrogen-bonding motif.
2. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (c1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, increasing polarity.
3. **Aromatic system**: The molecule has an aromatic ring (benzene or furan-like, though here it's likely a furan derivative due to the "o1" notation) connected to the nitro group.
4. **Amide-like linkages**: The N-C=O and N-N=C groups suggest additional hydrogen-bonding capacity.

### Comparison with training examples:
- Molecules with **nitro groups** (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 52.37).
- Molecules with **multiple hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23`) have very high values (133.75).
- The presence of **polar heterocycles** (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`) gives intermediate values (~41.57).
- The **hydantoin-like core** here is similar to some of the higher-value examples, but the exact combination is unique.

### Predicted property value:
Given the **nitro group + hydantoin core + aromatic system**, this molecule will likely have a **higher property value**, similar to other nitro-containing polar heterocycles. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**~50.0** (likely between 45 and 55, based on the examples).

### Refined prediction:
Looking closer, the structure resembles a hybrid of:
- The nitro-aromatic fragment (like the first example, value = 52.37).
- The hydantoin core (similar to some amide/imide examples with values ~40-50).

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**51.5** (close to the nitro-aromatic benchmark but slightly adjusted for the heterocycle). 

### Final answer:
**51.5**

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 24.06
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds** often have non-zero property values. For example:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a value of **26.02**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene derivative) has a value of **24.72**.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (carbazole) has a value of **26.02**.

2. **Symmetry and substitution** play a role:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative, similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene), but with a single nitrogen bridge instead of a double-bonded N=N. This suggests a slightly higher value than azobenzene due to increased flexibility and electron donation from the nitrogen lone pair.

3. **Comparison with similar structures**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1**: 26.02  
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 24.72  
   - **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally between these two, likely closer to **26.02** because the single N-N bond retains more electron density on nitrogen than the N=N bond.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Nc1ccccc1** (26.02) and the slightly reduced conjugation compared to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (24.72), the predicted value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:

**26.02**

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 75.27
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to another 5-membered ring (hydantoin-like core but with a cyclopentane).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The two amide groups are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically increases the property value (likely related to solubility, boiling point, or some other polar descriptor).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (75.27): This is a similar cyclic diamide with additional alkyl groups. The property is high due to the polar amides and cyclic structure.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (hydantoin core): If we had this in the examples, it would likely be high (similar to other cyclic amides).
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (29.1): This is a less polar cyclic amide (lactam), so the value is lower. The diamide here should be higher.

4. **Size and Rigidity**:
   - The molecule is small and rigid (two fused 5-membered rings), which may slightly reduce flexibility but not significantly impact polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the high polarity from the two amide groups and the cyclic structure, the value should be **close to other cyclic diamides** in the examples. The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (75.27), but our molecule lacks the extra alkyl groups, which might slightly reduce the value. 

However, the **cyclopentane ring** adds some hydrophobicity, but the two amides dominate. A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than 75.27 but still in the **60-70 range**. 

Looking at other examples:
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (61.44): This is a similar cyclic diamide with alkyl substitutions. Our molecule is simpler but structurally analogous.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (75.27): As mentioned, this is higher due to more alkyl groups.

Thus, splitting the difference, the predicted value is **~68.5**.

### Final Answer:
**68.5**

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of specific functional groups. Molecules with no polar groups or hydrogen-bonding capabilities (e.g., simple hydrocarbons like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, halogenated aromatics like `Clc1ccccc1Cl`, or non-polar structures like `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. 

The molecule in question, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure with no polar or hydrogen-bonding functional groups. It consists solely of a biphenyl core with chlorine substituents, which do not introduce significant polarity or hydrogen-bonding potential. 

Thus, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for this molecule is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trend**: The property values seem to correlate with molecular hydrophobicity (logP). Nonpolar, hydrocarbon-rich molecules (e.g., alkanes, simple aromatics) have lower values, while polar or functionalized molecules (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens) have higher values.
   - Example: **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a value of **0.0**, while **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) has **26.02** due to the polar -NH₂ group.

2. **Aromatic Hydrocarbons**: 
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not explicitly listed, but **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) has **26.02**, suggesting the base aromatic hydrocarbon (toluene) would be lower.
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) is **0.0**, but this is likely an outlier or special case (possibly due to symmetry or lack of polar interactions).

3. **Alkyl-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene) is a dialkyl-substituted benzene with no polar groups. It is more hydrophobic than toluene but less than hexylbenzene (which is oddly **0.0**). 

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has **12.89** due to the polar nitrogen.
   - **CCCC(=O)CC** (4-heptanone) has **17.07**, but this includes a carbonyl group.

### Prediction:
- **Diethylbenzene** is a nonpolar, symmetric hydrocarbon with no functional groups. Its value should be higher than **0.0** (hexylbenzene outlier) but lower than **26.02** (toluidine). 
- A reasonable estimate is **~12.0**, but given the inconsistency in the data (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** at **0.0**), I'll lean toward **20.23**, which appears frequently for nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC(O)C=C**, **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**).

### Final Answer:
**20.23**

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 86.18
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with:
   - An amino group (**NH2**) at position 1.
   - A sulfonamide group (**S(N)(=O)=O**) at position 4 (para to the amino group).

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - The **NH2** group is electron-donating and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - The **sulfonamide group** is polar, hydrogen-bond accepting (due to the S=O bonds), and can contribute to solubility or other polar interactions.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline) has a property value of **69.16**. This is structurally similar but replaces the sulfonamide with a nitro group.
   - **Nc1cccc2cccnc12** (a fused heterocycle with NH2) has a value of **33.12**.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine-like) has a value of **80.48**.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is more polar than nitroaniline due to the additional hydrogen-bonding capability of the sulfonamide.

4. **Sulfonamide Influence**:
   - Sulfonamides are typically more polar and have higher solubility contributions than nitro groups due to their ability to form stronger hydrogen bonds (both donating and accepting).
   - This suggests the property value should be higher than nitroaniline's **69.16**.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Given the increased polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than nitroaniline but not as high as highly polar heterocycles like purine derivatives.
   - A plausible value is **~75-80**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is **76.5**. 

This is based on interpolation between nitroaniline (69.16) and more polar heterocycles (80.48), accounting for the sulfonamide's additional polarity.

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with multiple fused benzene rings. Similar PAHs in the dataset (e.g., `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`, `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`) all have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules share the characteristic of being large, planar, and highly conjugated aromatic systems with no polar or functional groups.

2. **Lack of Functional Groups**: The molecule has no heteroatoms (like O, N, S), no halogens (like Cl, Br), and no polar substituents (like -OH, -NO2, -CO, etc.). The absence of such groups correlates strongly with a property value of **0.0** in the dataset.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: The molecule is symmetric and fully conjugated, similar to other PAHs in the dataset with a value of 0.0. This suggests that such structural features do not contribute to the property being measured (which appears to be related to polarity, solubility, or another group-dependent property).

4. **Comparison to Non-Zero Examples**: Molecules with non-zero values typically contain polar or ionizable groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO, -N, -S, etc.). Since this molecule lacks these, it aligns with the 0.0 trend.

### Predicted Property Value: **0.0**

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 107.22000000000001
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, it appears that the property being predicted is likely related to **water solubility** or **logP (partition coefficient)**, given the range of values and the trends observed. 

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Highly polar molecules with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups** tend to have higher values (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of 110.38).
2. **Molecules with no polar groups or halogens (Cl, Br, I, F)** tend to have values of 0.0 (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `Fc1ccccc1`).
3. **Aromatic systems with hydroxyl groups** often have moderate values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has 40.46).
4. **Molecules with carbonyl (C=O) and hydroxyl groups** tend to have higher values (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` has 58.2).

### Molecule to predict:
`Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`

Structural features:
- **Four hydroxyl (-OH) groups**: These significantly increase polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
- **One carbonyl (C=O) group**: Adds polarity.
- **Fused aromatic rings with oxygen linkages**: Enhances rigidity but also polarity due to oxygen.
- **No non-polar bulky groups**: No large hydrophobic regions.

Comparison to similar examples:
- `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` has a value of 70.67 (multiple -OH and aromatic rings).
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has a value of 40.46 (two -OH groups).

Given the **four -OH groups and a C=O group**, this molecule is even more polar than the examples above. Thus, its value should be **higher than 70.67** but likely less than 110.38 (which is for a fully sugar-like structure). 

### Predicted value: **~85.0** (estimated based on the high polarity and structural similarity to the higher-valued examples). 

However, looking more closely, the molecule resembles flavonoids or polyphenols, which are highly soluble. A more precise estimate would be:

**Final predicted value: 78.5** (balancing the aromaticity and multiple -OH groups). 

But given the examples, the closest fit is likely **~70-80**, so I'll refine to **75.0** as a conservative estimate. 

However, the presence of **four -OH groups and a C=O** suggests even higher, so **80.0** is more accurate. 

After reconsidering, the value is likely **82.3**. 

But to match the trend, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property value: 80.5**

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 55.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, Cc1cccc(C)c1)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0**, indicating minimal or no contribution to the property.
2. **Polar/Functional Groups**:
   - **Carboxylic Acid Esters (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC, CCCC(=O)OC)**: ~26.3
   - **Phosphate Esters (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: ~27.69
   - **Amides (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1)**: ~55.98
   - **Nitro Groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O)**: ~43.14
3. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**:
   - Hydroxyl (OH) groups (e.g., CCC(O)CC, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1) contribute ~20.23.
   - Multiple H-bond donors/acceptors (e.g., NC(N)=NC#N) can push values very high (~88.19).
4. **Complexity/Combination of Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl) have additive or synergistic effects (~44.76).

### Analysis of **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**:
- **Phosphate Group (P=O)**: Similar to phosphate esters in examples (~27.69).
- **Amide (NC(C)=O)**: Contributes ~55.98 (from NC(=O)c1cccnc1), but here it's part of a larger structure.
- **Thiol (SC)**: Likely adds some polarity (no direct example, but similar to other S-containing groups like Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1 ~45.75).
- **Methoxy (COP)**: Minor contribution (similar to COc1ccc(C=CC)cc1 ~9.23).

### Synthesis:
The molecule combines:
1. A phosphate group (~27.69).
2. An amide (~55.98, but scaled down as it's not standalone).
3. A thiol group (~45.75, but scaled down).
4. No hydrophobic dominance (no long aliphatic chains).

Given the additive but not fully cumulative nature of these groups, the property value is likely **between 30 and 50**. A reasonable estimate is **~38.0**, considering the phosphate and amide are the dominant contributors, and the thiol adds moderately.

### Final Prediction:
**38.0** (approximate, based on analogous examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The property could be related to solubility, polarity, or a specific bioactivity metric.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)** and **fully halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl)** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups like alcohols, carbonyls, or heteroatoms (N, O, S, etc.).
2. **Simple alkenes (C=C)** without polar functional groups (e.g., **CC1=CCCCC1**, **CCCC(=C)C**) also have a property value of **0.0**.
3. The presence of **chlorine atoms alone** (without other polar groups) does not necessarily increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has **0.0**).
4. The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a simple dichlorinated alkene with no additional functional groups (like OH, C=O, N, etc.).

### Conclusion:
Since **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a non-polar molecule (symmetrical trans-dichloroethene) with no hydrogen-bonding or other polar functional groups, its property value is likely **0.0**, consistent with similar examples in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 12.89
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with No Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules like **c1ccccc1** (benzene), **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene), and other simple aromatic hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**) have a property value of **0.0**. 
   - These lack polar or hydrogen-bonding functional groups.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms (N, O, S)**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) has a value of **12.03**, likely due to the weakly polar **N-methyl** group.
   - **Pyridine-like structures** (e.g., **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**, which is a fused heterocycle with multiple nitrogens) have higher values (e.g., **60.79**), but this is more complex.
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused nitrogen-containing heterocycle) has a value of **25.78**.

3. **Simple Heterocycles**:
   - Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It has a lone pair but no strongly polar substituents. 
   - Compared to **CNc1ccccc1** (12.03), pyridine's nitrogen is less polarizable (no alkyl group attached), but it is still more polar than pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**):
- Pyridine has a nitrogen atom contributing to polarity, but no additional functional groups. 
- Its property value is likely **higher than 0.0** (due to the nitrogen) but **lower than 12.03** (since it lacks an alkyl group on the nitrogen).
- A reasonable estimate is **~5.0**, but looking at the examples, the smallest non-zero value for a nitrogen-containing aromatic is **12.03**. Since pyridine is less polar than N-methylaniline, but still polar, I'll predict a value slightly lower than 12.03.

However, none of the examples directly include pyridine, so we must interpolate:
- If **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) is **12.03**, then pyridine (no alkyl group) might be slightly lower. 
- But **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (more nitrogens) is **25.78**, suggesting a single nitrogen in a simple ring would be lower.

Given the lack of exact matches, the most conservative estimate is **0.0** (since pyridine's polarity is modest and no similar simple heterocycles are non-zero in the examples). However, this seems unlikely given the nitrogen. 

Alternatively, if we assume the property is **solubility in some solvent or a partition coefficient**, pyridine is somewhat polar, so a value like **10.0** might be plausible. But the closest example is **CNc1ccccc1** at **12.03**, so pyridine might be slightly lower.

### Final Prediction:
Given the data and trends, the predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** is **10.0**. 

(Note: If the property is binary or categorical, the answer might differ, but assuming it's a continuous measure of polarity/solubility, this is a reasonable estimate.) 

However, looking back, the smallest non-zero value for a nitrogen-containing aromatic is **12.03**, so to align with the examples, I'll adjust to **12.03** as the closest match. 

But pyridine is less polar than N-methylaniline, so perhaps **8.0** is better. Given the uncertainty, the safest answer based on the examples is **0.0** (since no simple heterocycles are non-zero unless substituted). 

After reconsideration, the most consistent answer is **0.0**, as pyridine's polarity may not exceed the threshold in this property scale. 

**Final Answer: 0.0**

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 91.67999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains multiple polar groups: hydroxyl (**OCC(O)**), ester (**COC(=O)**), aromatic amine (**Nc2ccnc3**), and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring (**cc(Cl)ccc23**). These groups increase polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   
2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Two aromatic rings (one with a chloro substituent and one linked via an amine) and an ester-linked phenyl group contribute to the size and complexity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, property = 41.13) or ester + aromatic amine (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, property = 52.32) have higher values.
   - The presence of **Cl** and **N** in aromatic systems (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**, property = 0.0) doesn't always increase the value, but combined with polar linkers like esters and hydroxyls, the value tends to rise.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is larger than most examples, with a fused aromatic system and multiple functional groups. Larger polar molecules in the dataset (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = 121.38) have very high values, but this molecule isn't as heavily hydroxylated.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of:
- Ester (**COC(=O)**)
- Hydroxyl groups (**OCC(O)**)
- Aromatic amine (**Nc2ccnc3**)
- Chloro-substituted aromatic ring,

the molecule is likely to have a **higher value** than simpler esters/amines but lower than polyhydroxy compounds. A reasonable estimate is **~52.6**, similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** (52.6), which also has an ester and aromatic ring but lacks the additional polar groups. Accounting for the extra hydroxyls and amine, we adjust slightly higher.

**Final Prediction: 56.79**  
*(This matches the value for **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2**, which has comparable polarity and functional group complexity.)*

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional groups. The molecule in question, **CCCCCO (1-pentanol)**, has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, which is a polar and hydrogen-bonding functional group. 

Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (nonpolar, no -OH) has a property value of **0.0**.
- **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol with -OH) has a property value of **20.23**.
- **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclohexanol with -OH) also has a property value of **20.23**.
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (nonpolar, no -OH) has a property value of **0.0**.

Since **CCCCCO** is a primary alcohol (similar in polarity/hydrogen-bonding capability to the tertiary alcohol and cyclohexanol examples), its predicted property value would likely align with those molecules.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**, a **carbonyl group (C=O)**, and a **benzene ring (c2ccccc2)** attached to an **amide (Nc2ccccc2)**. It also has a **heterocyclic ring (CCO1)** with an **oxygen** and a **double bond (C1=C)**.
2. **Polarity and Functional Groups**: 
   - The sulfonyl and carbonyl groups are highly polar and can contribute significantly to the property value.
   - The aromatic ring with an amide linkage adds further polarity (similar to **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2**, which has a value of **52.04**).
   - The heterocyclic ring with oxygen resembles some of the cyclic structures in the examples (e.g., **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O**, which has **37.3**).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **sulfonyl groups** (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**) have high values (**56.79**).
   - Molecules with **amides + aromatic rings** (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**) have values around **58.2**.
   - The presence of **multiple polar groups** (sulfonyl, carbonyl, amide) suggests a higher value than simpler aromatic or aliphatic structures.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of **sulfonyl**, **amide**, and **aromatic** moieties, the property value is likely in the range of **50–60**. A reasonable estimate, based on similar structures, is:

**Predicted Property Value: 58.2**  

This aligns closely with **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (58.2)**, which has comparable polar/aromatic features. The sulfonyl group may slightly increase the value, but the overall structure is well-represented by this example.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 107.77
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be related to **polar surface area (PSA)** or **hydrogen bonding potential**, given the values and trends observed in the examples. Here's the reasoning:

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **High values (e.g., >50)** are associated with:
   - Multiple hydrogen bond acceptors/donors (e.g., `-NO2`, `-OH`, `-NH-`, `-C=O`, `-SO2-`).
   - Polar functional groups (e.g., `-N(=O)=O`, `-COOH`, `-PO4`).
   - Example: `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (89.52) has two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group.

2. **Low/zero values (e.g., 0.0)** are associated with:
   - Non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`).
   - Halogenated aromatics without polar groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`).

3. **Intermediate values (e.g., 10–50)** are associated with:
   - Single polar groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-NH-`, `-C=O`).
   - Example: `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (20.23) has one `-OH` and two `-Cl`.

### Analysis of the given molecule:
**SMILES:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC`  
- **Structural features:**
  1. Two ester groups (`-COOCH3`), which are hydrogen bond acceptors.
  2. A nitro group (`-NO2`), a strong hydrogen bond acceptor.
  3. An enamine-like nitrogen (`-NC=`), which can act as a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor.
  4. An aromatic ring (non-polar, but the `-NO2` adds polarity).

- **Comparison to examples:**
  - Similar to `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (89.52), but with fewer nitro groups and no `-CF3`.
  - Closer to `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (30.17) or `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (55.56), but with more polar groups.

### Predicted property value:
Given the two ester groups, one nitro group, and an enamine nitrogen, the molecule has **significant hydrogen bonding capacity**. The value likely falls in the **50–60 range**, similar to other molecules with multiple polar groups but fewer than the highest examples.

**Prediction:** **~55.0** (close to the 55.56 example with similar polar group count).

### Final answer:
**55.0**

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 75.27
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a diketopiperazine or succinimide-like core.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant hydrogen-bonding capability and polarity.
3. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, with both amides contributing equally to its properties.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**, property = 80.48) or hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (e.g., **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, property = 90.15) tend to have high property values.
   - The imide group is analogous to the urea/amide motifs in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 32.34) or **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 61.69), but with additional rigidity due to the cyclopropane ring.

### Key Observations:
- The property seems correlated with **hydrogen-bonding capacity** and **polarity**. The two amide groups in this molecule can act as both donors and acceptors, similar to high-value examples like **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (property = 63.24), which also has multiple polar groups.
- The cyclopropane ring adds rigidity but doesn’t significantly reduce polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values in the **60-70 range** (e.g., 61.69, 63.24, 66.76), and the presence of two amide groups, the predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is:

**63.24**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCC`, `C1CC=CC1`, `Clc1ccccc1`) and halogenated aromatic compounds without additional functional groups consistently have a property value of **0.0**. 

The molecule `ClCC` (chloroethane) is a very simple halogenated alkane with no additional functional groups or complexity. It is structurally similar to other simple molecules in the dataset that have a property value of **0.0**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `ClCC` is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 12.89
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br, F, I) or fully saturated hydrocarbons** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain specific functional groups that increase the value. Examples:
   - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (fully saturated hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (fully chlorinated) → 0.0
   - `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` (perchlorinated cage) → 0.0
   - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (brominated aromatic) → 0.0

2. **Aromatic rings with simple halogen substitution** (e.g., Cl, Br) but no other functional groups also tend to have a property value of **0.0**:
   - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2` → 0.0
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → 0.0

3. **Functional groups that increase the property value**:
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) → often ~43.14 (e.g., `CN(=O)=O`, `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12`).
   - Hydroxyl (`OH`) or polyhydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` → 121.38).
   - Amides, esters, or other polar groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` → 70.67).

4. **Partial halogenation with other polar groups** can lead to intermediate values:
   - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` (nitro + multiple Cl) → 43.14
   - `Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl` (OH + Cl) → 20.23

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**:
- It contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a chlorine (`Cl`).
- It also has a **CCl3 group** (trichloromethyl) attached to the pyridine.
- There are no other functional groups (e.g., nitro, hydroxyl, amide, etc.) that would increase the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2` (biphenyl with Cl) → 0.0
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (chlorinated biphenyl) → 0.0
- `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` (nitro + Cl) → 43.14 (nitro increases the value)
- `Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl` (OH + Cl) → 20.23 (OH increases the value)

Since the target molecule has **only halogen (Cl) substitutions and no other functional groups**, it fits the pattern of molecules with a property value of **0.0**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is **0.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with the presence of specific functional groups, particularly hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and their structural context. 

For the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol, a secondary alcohol with the -OH group on the second carbon of a hexane chain), we can observe that similar molecules with a single -OH group in an aliphatic chain (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**, **CC(O)c1ccccc1**, **CCC(C)CCO**, **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, etc.) consistently have a property value of **20.23**. 

This suggests that the presence of an -OH group in this structural context reliably predicts the property value of **20.23**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is:  
**20.23**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value is often **0.0** for molecules that are **non-polar, hydrophobic, or lack significant hydrogen-bonding or polar functional groups**. Conversely, higher values are associated with **polar, hydrogen-bonding, or heteroatom-rich structures** (e.g., amides, sulfonamides, hydroxyl groups, etc.).

For the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene):
1. It is a **symmetrical, non-polar aromatic compound** with only bromine substituents.
2. Bromine, while polarizable, does not contribute significantly to hydrogen bonding or strong polarity in this context (similar to how **Cl-substituted aromatics like Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** have a property value of **0.0**).
3. The molecule lacks any **hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors, charged groups, or other polar features** that would increase the property value.

**Conclusion**: The predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **0.0**, consistent with other non-polar halogenated aromatics in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of functional groups that can participate in dipole-dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with no polar or hydrogen-bonding functional groups (only C-Cl bonds and aromatic rings). From the examples, similar fully halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) have a property value of **0.0**, as the symmetry and lack of polarizable groups result in no net dipole or hydrogen-bonding potential.  

Thus, the predicted property value for this molecule is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 44.760000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of functional groups like hydroxyls, carbonyls, halogens, or other polar moieties. 

### Given molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Structural analysis:
1. **Phosphate group (P=O)**: This is highly polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (similar to molecules with P=O in the examples, which often have moderate to high property values).
2. **Aromatic rings with methyl groups**: These are non-polar (like in the examples where pure hydrocarbons or methyl-substituted aromatics have a property value of 0.0).
3. **Ether linkages (O-aryl)**: These are weakly polar but do not contribute significantly to hydrogen bonding.
4. **No strong hydrogen bond donors (like OH or NH)**: The phosphate oxygens are acceptors but not donors unless deprotonated (not indicated here).

### Comparison to examples:
- Molecules with **P=O** and polar groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`) have values like **55.84**.
- Molecules with **P=O but no strong H-bond donors** (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`) have lower values like **18.46**.
- The given molecule has **no strong H-bond donors** but has a **phosphate group**, so it should fall in the moderate range, likely higher than 18.46 but lower than 55.84 due to the lack of additional polar groups.

### Predicted property value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is **~32.34** (similar to other phosphate-containing molecules with limited H-bonding capability, like `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` or `CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`). 

**Final answer: 32.34**

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 20.310000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and polar group, which often increases the property value (e.g., see `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with a value of 118.36, where sulfonamide and electronegative groups dominate).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The presence of a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a heterocyclic attachment is common in molecules with moderate to high property values (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` has 80.48).
3. **Heterocyclic ketone with chloro substituents**: The `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` moiety introduces polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential, similar to molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (75.27) or `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (75.71).
4. **Chlorine atoms**: These add lipophilicity but may not drastically alter the property if the molecule is already polar (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has 43.14).

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The combination of **CF3**, **aromatic ring**, **heterocyclic ketone**, and **chlorine substituents** suggests a property value in the **higher range**, similar to molecules with sulfonamides or multiple polar groups (e.g., 75–90).
- The presence of the **CF3 group** and **ketone** is particularly influential, as seen in `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (75.27) and `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (80.48).

### Predicted value:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with values in the **75–85 range**, a reasonable prediction for **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** is:

**82.5** (approximate midpoint of the range). 

This accounts for the polar contributions of the CF3 group, the heterocyclic ketone, and the chloro substituents.

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 52.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: This is an electron-donating group (EDG).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: This is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG).

2. **Similar examples in the dataset**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 86.28): This is dinitrobenzene, with two nitro groups. The property is high due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro groups.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (property = 20.23): Phenol, with an -OH group (less electron-withdrawing than -NO2).
   - **Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2** (property = 33.12): A fused aromatic system with an -OH group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.

3. **Effect of substituents**:
   - The nitro group (-NO2) significantly increases the property value (as seen in dinitrobenzene).
   - The methoxy group (-OCH3) is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2 but more electron-donating than -OH.

### Prediction:
The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) has one strong electron-withdrawing group (-NO2) and one moderate electron-donating group (-OCH3). This is somewhat similar to:
- The dinitrobenzene (86.28), but with one nitro group replaced by a methoxy group, which would reduce the property value.
- The phenol (20.23), but with a nitro group added, which would increase the property value.

Given these comparisons, the property value is likely between the phenol (20.23) and dinitrobenzene (86.28), but closer to the higher end due to the strong influence of the nitro group. 

A reasonable estimate is **~50-60**. Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (property = 52.6): This is dimethyl phthalate, with two ester groups (moderate electron-withdrawing).
- **Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2** (property = 33.12): A fused aromatic system with less electron-withdrawing character.

Given that the nitro group is stronger than ester groups, the value should be higher than 52.6 but not as high as 86.28. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is **54.86**. 

(This matches the value for **Cn1ccc(=O)[nH]c1=O** in the dataset, which also has a nitro-like group and similar electron-withdrawing character.)

Iteration: 72
SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and electronic structure). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br) or fully saturated hydrocarbons** tend to have a value of **0.0** (e.g., `ClCCCl`, `Clc1ccccc1`, `Fc1ccc(F)cc1`, `BrC(Br)Br`, `CCCCl`). This suggests that simple halogenated or non-polar aliphatic structures contribute minimally to molar refractivity in this context.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar or conjugated groups** (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, carbonyls `C=O`, hydroxyl `O`, etc.) have higher values (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` = 86.28).
3. **Chlorinated aliphatic or cyclic systems** with no additional polar/conjugated groups often default to **0.0** (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` = 0.0).

### Analysis of the target molecule:
The molecule is a **highly chlorinated polycyclic alkane**:
```
ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
```
- It has **no aromaticity, no polar/conjugated groups**, and is entirely composed of **chlorinated aliphatic carbons**.
- Structurally, it resembles `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane, which has a value of 0.0 in the dataset).

### Prediction:
Since the molecule is a **fully chlorinated, non-aromatic, non-polar polycyclic system**, its predicted property value is:  
**0.0**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar halogenated aliphatic structures in the provided examples.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's break down the structural features that correlate with the property values:

1. **Functional Groups Present**:
   - **Ester (COO)**: The molecule has an ester group (COO), which is polar and can contribute to the property value. 
   - **Alkyl Chain (CCC)**: A short alkyl chain (propyl group) is present, which is non-polar and tends to reduce the property value unless balanced by polar groups.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (52.32)**: This is an ester with an aromatic amine substituent. The presence of the aromatic amine significantly increases the property value.
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2 (56.79)**: Another ester with polar substituents (amide and ether linkages), leading to a higher value.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1 (20.23)**: An alcohol with an aromatic ring, giving a moderate value.
   - **CC#N (23.79)**: A nitrile group, which is polar but simpler than an ester, gives a value of ~23.79.

3. **Simpler Esters/Alcohols**:
   - Esters without additional polar groups (like **CCCOC=O**) are less polar than those with aromatic or multiple functional groups. 
   - The property value for **CCCOC=O** should be lower than esters with aromatic/amine substituents (e.g., 52.32, 56.79) but higher than non-polar molecules (e.g., alkanes, halocarbons with 0.0).

4. **Approximation**:
   - The simplest ester in the examples is not explicitly given, but comparing with **CC(O)c1ccccc1 (20.23)** (an alcohol with an aromatic ring) and **CC#N (23.79)** (a nitrile), **CCCOC=O** (an aliphatic ester) would likely have a value in the range of **20-30**, leaning toward the lower end due to the lack of additional polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCOC=O**: **20.23**  
This matches the value seen for other simple polar molecules like **CC(O)c1ccccc1** and **CC#N**, which lack extended conjugation or additional polar substituents.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the patterns observed, the property being predicted appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and functional groups). 

### Analysis of the given molecule: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** (decyl acetate, or more precisely, a C10 fatty acid ethyl ester)
1. **Long hydrocarbon chain (CCCCCCCCCC)**: Hydrocarbon chains (e.g., alkanes like CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, CCCC1CCCCC1) typically contribute **0.0** to the property unless functional groups are present.
2. **Ester group (C(=O)OCC)**: 
   - Esters (e.g., COCC(=O)N(...), CCOC(=O)CCN(...)) often contribute significantly. 
   - Smaller esters like CCOc1ccccc1 (ethyl phenyl ether, though not an ester, has an ether linkage) have a value of **9.23**.
   - Larger esters or those with additional polar groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)CCN...) have higher values (~17-68).
   - The ester here is simple (no additional heteroatoms or rings), so the contribution should be moderate.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (an aldehyde) has a value of **17.07**.
- **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde) also has **17.07**.
- **CCOc1ccccc1** (ethyl phenyl ether) has **9.23**.
- **CCCOC** (propyl ether) has **9.23**.

Given that the molecule has a long hydrocarbon chain (contributing ~0) and a simple ester group (likely contributing ~9-17), the predicted value should be close to the ester/ether examples. 

### Predicted property value:
**17.07** (similar to the aldehyde examples, as the ester group is slightly more polarizable than an ether but less than complex esters). 

Thus, the predicted value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is **17.07**.

True Property: 92.47
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**: Present in examples like `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (20.23) and `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (9.23). Phenol alone tends to contribute moderately (~20), but substitution reduces it.
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Present in many examples, often reducing or slightly increasing the property depending on context (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is 43.14).
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Seen in `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (41.57) and `NC(=O)c1ccccc1` (43.09). This group tends to increase the property significantly (~40-50).
4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (43.14) and `NNc1ccccc1` (38.05). Nitro groups strongly increase the property (~40-45).
5. **Aromatic rings**: Multiple substituted aromatic rings (like in `CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O`, 92.5) can lead to very high values when combined with polar groups.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles a combination of:
  - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (41.57), which has an amide and phenol.
  - `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (43.14), which has a nitro group and chlorine.
  - The presence of **both an amide and a nitro group** suggests additive or synergistic effects, as seen in high-value examples like `CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O` (92.5).

### Predicted property:
Given the combined effects of:
- Amide (~40-50),
- Nitro (~40-45),
- Phenol (~20, but reduced by substitution),
- Chlorine (minor influence),

The property is likely **higher than the individual contributions** due to the conjugated polar groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 75.27**  
(This aligns with other high-value examples like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1` and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC`, which also feature multiple polar groups and aromatic systems.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 55.38000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observed Patterns:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with no polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., pure hydrocarbons like `CCCCCCCC`, `c1ccccc1`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`).
   - Halogenated aromatics without other polar groups (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`).
   - Sulfur-containing non-polar molecules (e.g., `CCSSCC`).

2. **Property = 20.23**: 
   - Molecules with a single hydroxyl group (`-OH`) or carbonyl group (`C=O`) in a flexible chain (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C`, `CCCC(C)CO`, `CCCO`, `CCC(O)CC`).

3. **Higher Values (e.g., 29.1, 46.01, 60.79, 75.27)**:
   - Molecules with multiple hydrogen-bond acceptors/donors (e.g., amides, ureas, or heterocycles like `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (75.27), `COc1ncnc2nccnc12` (60.79)).
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or sulfonamides (`S(=O)(=O)N`) contribute significantly (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` (86.18)).

4. **Phosphorothioate Groups (`P(=S)(OC)OC`)**:
   - The molecule `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a property of **38.77**, suggesting that the `P(=S)(OC)OC` group contributes moderately (similar to sulfonamides or polar groups).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** has:
- Two **phosphorothioate groups (`P(=S)(OC)OC`)**.
- A **thioether linkage (`S`)**, which is less polar than oxygen but still contributes.
- No strong hydrogen-bond donors (like `-OH` or `-NH`), but multiple hydrogen-bond acceptors (oxygen and sulfur).

### Comparison:
- The presence of two `P(=S)(OC)OC` groups (similar to the example with one such group and a property of 38.77) suggests a higher value.
- The lack of additional polar groups (like `-OH` or `-NH`) prevents the value from being very high (e.g., > 75).
- The thioether (`S`) linkage is less polar than an ether (`O`), but the two `P(=S)(OC)OC` groups dominate.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property is likely **slightly higher than 38.77** (due to the second `P(=S)(OC)OC` group) but not as high as values like 75.27 (which require more hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors). 

A reasonable estimate is **~50.0**. 

However, looking at the examples, the highest contribution from `P(=S)(OC)OC` is 38.77, and adding a second one might not double it (due to diminishing returns). Thus, a more conservative estimate is **~45.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**45.0** (approximate, based on the observed trends).

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 63.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C=CC=C, C1CCC2CCCCC2C1, CCCCC)**: These have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that purely hydrocarbon structures (no heteroatoms or functional groups) default to 0.0.
2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = 52.37
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = 43.14
   - The presence of a nitro group tends to increase the property value significantly (often >40).
3. **Phenol (OH attached to benzene)**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = 20.23
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**: Property = 20.23
   - Phenol derivatives without other strong functional groups often have values around 20.23.
4. **Combined nitro and phenol**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a **nitrophenol** (specifically, 2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol). This combines a phenol and a nitro group.
   - From the examples, nitro groups add ~40-50, and phenol adds ~20. However, the combination may not be purely additive.

### Most Similar Example:
- **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: This is a nitrophenol derivative (with additional chloro substituents) and has a property value of **52.37**.
- The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is simpler (no chloro substituents), so its value might be slightly lower but still in a similar range.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of the nitro group and the phenol moiety, the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely close to **52.37** but slightly lower due to fewer substituents. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 50.94**  
*(This aligns with the trend of nitro-aromatics and is consistent with the observed values for similar structures.)*

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 268.67999999999995
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be **water solubility** or a related **polarity metric** (such as logP or a solubility score), where higher values indicate greater solubility/polarity and lower values (often 0.0) indicate hydrophobicity or insolubility in water.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule is a **complex carbohydrate (oligosaccharide or polysaccharide-like structure)** with the formula:
```
OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
```
Key features:
1. Multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`) and ether linkages (`-O-`), which are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
2. No hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains, aromatic rings without polar substituents).
3. Structurally similar to sugars like sucrose or maltose, which are highly water-soluble.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with many `-OH` groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`, value = 90.15) have very high property values.
- Hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)`, value = 0.0) are insoluble.
- The given molecule has even more `-OH` groups than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`, suggesting **higher solubility**.

### Prediction:
The molecule is **extremely water-soluble** due to its polyhydroxy nature. The closest analog in the examples is `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (value = 90.15), but this molecule is larger and has more `-OH` groups. 

Given the trend, the predicted property value is likely **>90**. However, since no example exceeds ~118.36 (for a highly polar/ionic structure), and this is a neutral but very polar molecule, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: ~110.0**  
(Note: If the property is logS or similar, this would imply very high solubility; if it's a scaled metric, the value may cap lower.) 

However, based on the examples, the highest value for a neutral polyol is 90.15, so a conservative estimate would be:

**Final predicted value: 95.0**  
(Reflecting very high solubility, but not exceeding the highest observed neutral compound in the dataset.) 

Would you like to clarify the exact property being predicted (e.g., logS, solubility score, etc.) for a more precise estimate?
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Alkenes**: 
   - Molecules like **CCCC(=O)C** (2-pentanone) and **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) have values around **17.07**.
   - Simple hydrocarbons like **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (hexamethylbenzene) and **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** (fluorene) have a value of **0.0**.

2. **Alkynes**:
   - The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (1,4-dicyanobenzene), which has a value of **47.58**. However, this also contains aromatic rings and nitrile groups, which likely contribute to the higher value.
   - **CCC#C** is a simpler alkyne (no aromaticity or other functional groups).

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N) tend to have higher values.
   - Pure hydrocarbons (no polar groups) tend to have values of **0.0** or low values unless they have significant polarity or conjugation.

4. **Small Alkynes**:
   - **CCC#C** is a small, linear alkyne with no additional functional groups. The triple bond introduces some polarity, but it is not as polar as molecules with -OH or -C=O.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCCC=C**) have a value of **0.0**.
- The triple bond in **CCC#C** introduces slight polarity, but not as much as in **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (which has additional nitrile groups).

A reasonable estimate for **CCC#C** would be close to **0.0**, but slightly higher due to the triple bond. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCC#C: 0.0** (or a very low value, likely ≤ 5.0, but the closest match in the examples is **0.0** for similar hydrocarbons). 

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is **0.0**.

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 18.46
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Phosphorus (P) and Sulfur (S):**
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** or similar phosphorus-sulfur groups tend to have moderate to high property values. For example:
     - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** → **38.77**
     - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** → **71.06**
   - The presence of **P(=S)** seems to contribute significantly to the property value.

2. **Chlorine (Cl) Substitution:**
   - Chlorine substitutions alone (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) often result in **0.0**, but when combined with other functional groups (e.g., P=S or polar groups), the property value increases.

3. **Ether Linkages (O-alkyl):**
   - Ether linkages (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**) tend to increase the property value moderately (e.g., **29.46** in this case).

4. **Alkyl Chains:**
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCC**) or non-polar groups typically result in **0.0**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has:
- A **P(=S)** group (similar to the examples with values ~38.77 and ~71.06).
- An ether linkage (**Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**).
- Chlorine substitutions (but not in isolation, as they are part of a larger polar structure).

Given the presence of **P(=S)** and the ether linkage, the property value is likely to be in the moderate range, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (38.77)** but slightly lower due to fewer polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
**38.5** (approximating based on the closest examples). 

This is consistent with the observed trend for molecules containing **P(=S)** and polar substituents.

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 68.01
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The hydrazide group is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor), which often increases the property value in the given dataset.
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and contributes to polarity but is less impactful than the hydrazide.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1Cl (26.02)**: Aniline derivative with a polar group (NH2 and Cl). The hydrazide here is more polar than NH2.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12 (26.02)**: Similar aromatic + NH2 group.
   - **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (100.45)**: High value due to multiple H-bond donors/acceptors (similar to hydrazide).
   - **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1 (71.96)**: Polar substituents (N and O) increase the value.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **C(=O)NN** (hydrazide) is a strong contributor due to H-bonding and polarity.
   - The pyridine ring alone (without substituents) would contribute little (e.g., **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (25.78)**), but the hydrazide elevates it.

### Predicted Property:
Given the hydrazide's strong polar/H-bonding influence, the value should be **higher than simple aromatic amines (~26)** but **lower than highly polar heterocycles like 100.45**. 

A reasonable estimate is **~50-60**. Comparing to similar molecules:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO (54.37)**: Ketone + alcohol.
- **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (54.86)**: Polar amide/imide.

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** is:  
**55.0** (approximate midpoint of the 50-60 range). 

### Final Answer:
**55.0**

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 38.77
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a property value of **70.83**. The presence of **P(=S)** often correlates with higher property values, especially when combined with other polar or reactive groups.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The amide group is present in the fragment **SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**. Amides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** with **23.55**) tend to contribute moderately to the property value, but the exact contribution depends on the context.

3. **Thioether Linkage (SCC)**: The sulfur linkage is not highly polarizable on its own, but in combination with other groups, it can contribute to the property value.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: Long alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI** with **0.0**) typically do not contribute significantly unless they are part of a larger polar or functionalized system.

5. **Cyclic Amine (N1CCCCC1C)**: The piperidine ring is somewhat polar but not as strongly as aromatic or highly functionalized rings. Its contribution is likely modest.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the given examples is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a value of **70.83**. This molecule also contains **P(=S)** and an aromatic nitro group, which is more polar than the amide in our target molecule.
- Another relevant example is **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property value **23.55**), which has an amide but lacks the **P(=S)** group.
- The combination of **P(=S)** and **C(=O)N** suggests a value higher than simple amides but likely lower than the nitro-containing phosphorothioate example.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the presence of both **P(=S)** and **C(=O)N**, but without highly polarizing groups like nitro (**N(=O)=O**), the property value is expected to be in the range of **50-60**. 

A reasonable estimate is **54.86**, which matches the value of **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (also containing polarizable groups like amides and halogens).

### Final Answer:
**54.86**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with the presence of functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding or have significant polarity (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -NH, -CO, halogens like Cl/Br attached to aromatic rings, etc.). 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or polar moieties, the property value is consistently **0.0** in the given dataset (similar to other non-polar molecules like `c1ccsc1`, `Fc1ccccc1`, `CCCC/C=C/C`, etc.). 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC` is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 57.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**: 
   - Molecules with steroid-like or fused polycyclic structures (e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**) tend to have moderate to high property values (e.g., 54.37, 37.3, 94.83).
   - The presence of **ketone (=O)** and **hydroxyl (OH)** groups increases the property value significantly.

2. **Impact of Functional Groups**:
   - **Ketone (=O)**: Increases the property (e.g., 54.37, 75.27).
   - **Hydroxyl (OH)**: Further increases the property (e.g., 94.83 for a steroid with OH and =O).
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but likely neutral or slightly increasing if combined with polar groups.

3. **Property Trends**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CCCCCCC1**, **CCC1CCCCC1**) have a property of **0.0**.
   - Complex polycyclic structures with polar groups (OH, =O) range from **30–100**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- **Structure**: The molecule is a **polycyclic steroid-like structure** with:
  - A **ketone (=O)** group.
  - Two **hydroxyl (OH)** groups (one on ring 1 and one on ring 4).
  - An **alkyne (C#C)** group (uncommon in examples, but likely minor impact).
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property = 54.37), but with an extra OH group and alkyne.
  - The additional OH group likely increases the property further (e.g., **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** has property = 94.83 due to multiple OH and =O groups).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to high-value examples and the presence of **two OH groups and one =O group**, the predicted property is likely in the **higher range** (similar to 94.83 but slightly lower due to the alkyne). 

**Final Prediction: ~85.0**  
*(A reasonable estimate based on the examples, likely between 75–95 due to the polar groups and polycyclic framework.)*  

However, looking closely at **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCC3CCC2C3** (property = 75.27) and **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property = 37.3), the exact value depends on the positioning of the OH and =O groups. Since this molecule has **two OH groups and one =O**, a value closer to **~60-70** might also be plausible, but the steroid-like framework with multiple polar groups suggests a higher value.  

**Refined Prediction: 72.5**  
*(Balancing the impact of the polar groups and the polycyclic core.)*  

But given the example **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (94.83), which has more polar groups, this molecule might be slightly lower.  

**Final Answer: 68.4**  

*(This is an educated estimate based on the examples, likely falling between 65–75 due to the structural features.)*  

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest analog is **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property = 37.3), but with an extra OH group, the value should be higher.  

**Adjusted Prediction: 54.37**  
*(Matching the value of **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**, which is very similar but with one less OH group.)*  

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted Property: 54.37**  
*(Same as the closest example with minor adjustments for the extra OH group.)*  

But to be precise, the extra OH group would add ~10-20 units, so:  
**Final Prediction: 64.0**  

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:  
**Predicted Property: 54.37** (same as the closest example, as the alkyne and extra OH may balance out).  

However, the presence of two OH groups likely increases it further.  

**Final Answer: 62.5**  

*(This is a compromise between the examples and the additional polar groups.)*  

But given the variability, the safest answer is:  
**Predicted Property: 54.37** (same as the closest example).  

For consistency with the examples, I'll stick with:  
**Predicted Property: 54.37**  

*(The structure is very similar to the example with property = 54.37, and the additional OH group's impact is unclear from the given data.)*  

**Final Answer: 54.37**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 160.83
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional group contributions (e.g., hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, ethers, halogens, etc.). Here's the reasoning:

### Key structural features of the given molecule:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`)**: These significantly increase polarity and hydrogen bonding potential (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has a value of 20.23, and `OCc1ccccc1` also has 20.23).
2. **Ether linkages (`-O-`)**: These contribute to polarity but less than hydroxyls (e.g., `CCCCOCCO` has 29.46).
3. **Carbonyl groups (`C=O`)**: These are polar and can form hydrogen bonds (e.g., `CCCCCCC(=O)C` has 17.07).
4. **Fused ring systems**: Aromatic or aliphatic fused rings without polar groups tend to have a value of 0.0 (e.g., `c1ccccc1` or `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`).
5. **Complexity**: The molecule is large and has multiple polar groups, which suggests additive effects.

### Comparison to examples:
- Molecules with 2-3 hydroxyl groups and ethers (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`) have values around 20-30.
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` with 75.27) have much higher values due to strong hydrogen bonding.
- The given molecule has **4 hydroxyl groups**, **2 ether linkages**, and **1 carbonyl group**, which suggests a higher value than simple mono-hydroxyl/ether examples but lower than highly polar, compact structures like `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1`.

### Predicted value:
Given the additive contributions of the polar groups and the size of the molecule, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **38-45**. A reasonable estimate is **38.69**, similar to the steroid-like molecule `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (which has multiple hydroxyls and ethers and a value of 38.69).

### Final answer:
**38.69**
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property being predicted appears to be **water solubility (in mg/L at 25°C)**, as the values range from 0.0 (very insoluble) to higher values (more soluble), and the trends correlate with functional groups known to affect solubility (e.g., polar groups like -OH, -NO₂ increase solubility, while nonpolar/halogenated structures decrease it).

### Analysis of the given molecule: **Oc1ccccc1Cl**  
This is **4-chlorophenol** (or 2-chlorophenol, but position doesn't change solubility significantly here). It has:
- A polar **hydroxyl group (-OH)**, which increases solubility (as seen in similar molecules like `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` with solubility = 63.37).
- A **chlorine substituent (-Cl)**, which tends to decrease solubility (as seen in halogenated aromatics like `Clc1ccccc1I` with solubility = 0.0).

### Comparison to similar examples:
1. **`Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`** (nitrophenol): Solubility = 63.37  
   The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly polar, increasing solubility.  
2. **`Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`** (another nitrophenol): Solubility = 63.37 (same as above).  
3. **`Clc1ccccc1I`** (halogenated benzene): Solubility = 0.0 (no polar groups).  
4. **`Fc1ccccc1`** (fluorobenzene): Solubility = 0.0 (halogen but no -OH).  

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- The -OH group dominates over the -Cl, so solubility will be > 0.  
- It lacks the strong solubilizing effect of -NO₂ (as in nitrophenol), so solubility will be **lower than 63.37**.  
- A reasonable estimate is **~30–40 mg/L**, based on:  
  - `COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (multiple -Cl and -OCH₃): 29.46  
  - `CON(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (polar but halogenated): 41.57  

### Final predicted value:  
**~35.0 mg/L** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the examples).  

*(Note: The exact value may vary slightly, but this is a reasonable interpolation from the given data.)*

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 38.33
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **ClCC#CC**: A chloroalkyne fragment (rare in the examples, but halogens like Cl are present in many molecules with varying properties).
   - **OC(=O)N**: A carbamate (urethane) group (similar to amides/esters in the examples, which often contribute to higher property values).
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: A chlorinated aniline fragment (similar to other aromatic systems with Cl or N substitutions, which can moderately increase the property value).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The carbamate group (**OC(=O)N**) can act as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, increasing polarity.
   - The chloro substituents add some polarity but are not as impactful as hydrogen-bonding groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Similar to carbamate/amide-containing molecules**:
     - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (75.71) and `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (75.71): These have two aromatic rings and multiple H-bonding sites, leading to very high values. Our molecule is simpler but shares the carbamate motif.
     - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (20.31): Contains a polar amide and halogenated groups, but the property is lower due to less extensive H-bonding.
     - `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (38.33): Contains an amide and ether, similar to our carbamate + ether combination.
   - **Chlorinated aromatics**:
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (0.0): Fully chlorinated, non-polar, so property is 0. Our molecule has only one Cl on the ring and additional polar groups.
     - `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F` (58.2): Highly fluorinated and polar, with multiple H-bonding sites. Our molecule is less polar but has some similarity.

4. **Expected Property Range**:
   - The carbamate group and chloro substituents suggest a value **between 30 and 50**, based on similar molecules like `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (38.33) and `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (46.0).
   - The alkyne fragment is non-polar but short, so it won’t drag the value down significantly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above analysis, a reasonable estimate is **~40.0**, balancing the polar carbamate and chloroaromatic against the non-polar alkyne. 

However, looking closely at `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (46.0), which has a lactam (similar H-bonding to carbamate) and chloroaromatic, our molecule is very similar but with an extra ether linkage. This might slightly reduce the value compared to the lactam. 

Thus, a more precise prediction is **~42.0**.

### Final Answer:
**42.0**

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 46.010000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be related to **polar surface area (PSA)**, which is influenced by the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -NO₂, -SO₃H, carbonyls, etc.) and heteroatoms (N, O, S, halogens).

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phenol-like -OH group**: Contributes significantly to PSA (e.g., in the examples, phenol derivatives like `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` have PSA = 40.46).
2. **Two aromatic rings with Cl substituents**: Chlorine atoms are weakly polar but do not contribute much to PSA (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has PSA = 0.0).
3. **Pyrimidine-like heterocycle (c2cncnc2)**: Nitrogen-containing aromatic rings contribute to PSA (e.g., `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has PSA = 71.79).
4. **Bulky aromatic systems**: The overall size and conjugation reduce PSA contributions from some polar groups due to steric hindrance.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- Molecules with **-OH + aromatic N** (e.g., `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) have high PSA (~71.79).
- Molecules with **multiple Cl substituents** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`) have PSA = 0.0 unless paired with polar groups.
- The given molecule combines **-OH, aromatic N, and Cl substituents**, but the bulky aromatic systems may partially offset the PSA contribution.

### Estimated PSA:
Given the **-OH (40.46-like contribution)** and **pyrimidine (71.79-like contribution)**, but with steric hindrance from the bulky aromatic systems and Cl substituents, the PSA is likely **intermediate**. 

A reasonable estimate is **~50-60**. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (PSA = 61.69) is structurally close (aromatic N, Cl, -OH-like).
- `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (PSA = 63.24) also has polar groups and Cl.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property (PSA) for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** is **~58.0**. 

(Note: Without explicit training data or a model, this is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCCOC=O**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule **CCCCOC=O** contains an ester functional group (R-CO-O-R'). 
   - Similar molecules with esters:
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (property = 26.3)
     - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)C(CC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC34C)OC(C)=O** (property = 127.2, but this is a much more complex steroid-like structure)
     - **CC(=O)OC3(CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C)C(C)=O** (property = 60.44, also a complex structure)
   - The closest simple ester is **CCCC(=O)OCC** (butyl acetate, property = 26.3).

2. **Chain Length**: The molecule **CCCCOC=O** is a linear ester with a 4-carbon alkyl chain (butyl group) and a formyl group (HCO-). This is structurally similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butanoate), but with one fewer carbon in the alcohol-derived part (HCO- instead of C2H5O-).

3. **Polarity and Size**: The property seems to correlate with polarity and size. Smaller, less polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halocarbons) tend to have values close to 0, while polar or larger molecules (e.g., nitro compounds, esters, amides) have higher values. The formate ester (**HCOOR**) is slightly more polar than **RCOOR'** due to the smaller alkoxy group.

4. **Comparison to Other Esters**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butanoate): 26.3
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (furan-2-carbaldehyde, not an ester but has a formyl group): 30.21
   - **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate) is expected to have a slightly higher value than ethyl butanoate due to the formyl group's increased polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate) is likely slightly higher than **CCCC(=O)OCC** (26.3) but lower than **O=Cc1ccco1** (30.21). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 28.0** (rounded to one decimal place, consistent with the dataset). 

This aligns with the trend that formate esters are slightly more polar than other esters of similar size.
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with simple halogenated alkanes (such as ClCCCl, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, and CCBr) is consistently **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups or structural features that contribute to the property in question (which appears to be related to polarity, hydrogen bonding, or some other interaction-based metric).

The molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane analog, but with only two chlorines on a single carbon) is structurally similar to **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) and other halogenated alkanes with property values of 0.0. There are no additional functional groups or heteroatoms that would increase the property value.

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Phenol-like structures (aromatic ring with -OH group)**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a property value of **40.46**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol) has a property value of **20.23**.
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** (diphenylmethanol-like) has a value of **40.46**.

2. **Methyl-substituted phenols**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol or similar). 
   - The presence of two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**, which has a value of **20.23**.

3. **Impact of substituents**:
   - Adding methyl groups to phenol tends to reduce the property value compared to unsubstituted phenol or dihydroxy phenols (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1** has 40.46, while methylated versions are lower).
   - The value seems to scale with the number of polar groups (e.g., -OH increases it, while non-polar alkyl groups like -CH3 decrease it).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = 20.23), the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (another dimethylphenol) should have a **similar or identical value**. 

### Final Answer:
**20.23**

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (especially chlorine) aromatic compounds** tend to have a property value of **0.0**:
   - Example: **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** → 0.0
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** → 0.0
   - Example: **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** → 0.0
   - Example: **ClCBr** → 0.0

2. The given molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with multiple chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings:
   - Structure: Two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl), with chlorine substituents at multiple positions.

3. This matches the trend where **highly halogenated (especially chlorine or bromine) aromatic systems** consistently show a property value of **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
The molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** fits the pattern of heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds, which all have a property value of **0.0** in the provided examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional group presence. The molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is a nonpolar hydrocarbon with no hydrogen-bonding groups (no -OH, -NH, -COOH, etc.) and no significant dipole moment.

From the examples:
- Simple hydrocarbons like **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** (naphthalene), **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (alkyl-substituted benzene), and **CCCCCCCC** (octane) all have a property value of **0.0**.
- Molecules with polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -NO₂) have higher values.

Since **CC=C(C)C** is structurally similar to nonpolar hydrocarbons in the dataset (e.g., **CCCCCCCC**, **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**), the predicted property value is:

**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify several patterns that correlate molecular structures with the property values:

1. **Simple alkanes and hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1`, `C=CCCC=C`, `CCC(C)C(C)C`) have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups or halogens.

2. **Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH)** attached to aromatic rings (e.g., `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`) typically have a property value of **20.23** or slightly higher if additional substituents (like halogens) are present.

3. **Molecules with halogens (Cl, F, Br, I)** often have higher values, especially if combined with other polar groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(c1)C(F)(F)F` = 32.34, `CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` = 29.1).

4. **Highly polar or complex functional groups** (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, sulfonamides `S(=O)(=O)`, or multiple halogens) lead to even higher values (e.g., `CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` = 89.52).

5. **Small halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`) have a property value of **0.0**, suggesting that simple halogen substitution alone does not increase the value unless combined with other features.

### Prediction for `ClCCl` (Dichloromethane):
- This is a simple dihalogenated alkane with no additional functional groups or aromaticity.
- Similar examples like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) and `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a polychlorinated hydrocarbon) have a value of **0.0**.
- No hydroxyl, nitro, or other polar groups are present to increase the value.

Thus, the predicted property value for `ClCCl` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** can be predicted by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Symmetrical Polychlorinated Phenols/Ethers**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is very similar to the given molecule but with slightly different chlorine positions) has a property value of **20.23**.
   - Another similar molecule, **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, also has a value of **20.23** (same as above, likely the same structure).
   - The molecule **O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23** has a value of **55.56**, but this is more complex and includes nitrogen and carbonyl groups, so it's less relevant.
   - The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** also has a value of **20.23**, but this is an aliphatic alcohol, so it's less directly comparable.

2. **Chlorine Substitution Pattern**:
   - The presence of multiple chlorines on an aromatic ring with an oxygen substituent (OH or O-ether) tends to correlate with values around **20.23** in the dataset.

3. **Other Examples**:
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (a fully brominated benzene) has a value of **0.0**, but this is bromine instead of chlorine and lacks an oxygen substituent.
   - **ClCC** (a simple chloroalkane) has a value of **0.0**, but this is not aromatic.

### Conclusion:
The most directly comparable molecule in the dataset is **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, which has a property value of **20.23**. Since the given molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is almost identical (only differing in the position of one chlorine), the predicted property value is the same.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 160.83
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and electronic structure). The values are typically in the range of 0 to ~200, with higher values indicating larger or more polarizable molecules.

### Analysis of the given molecule:
The molecule is complex, with multiple functional groups and rings:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Key features:
1. **Aromatic rings** (contributing significantly to refractivity).
2. **Multiple oxygen-containing groups**: methoxy (`OCH3`), hydroxyl (`OH`), and carbonyl (`C=O`) groups (all increase refractivity).
3. **Fused ring systems** (large volume contribution).
4. **Ether linkages** (`O` in rings and chains).
5. **No halogens or heavy atoms** (which would otherwise dominate refractivity).

### Comparison with similar examples:
- The molecule resembles large, oxygen-rich structures like:
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (189.53) – a sugar-like structure with many hydroxyls and ethers.
  - `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (94.83) – a steroid-like structure with carbonyls and hydroxyls.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities suggests a high refractivity value, likely >100.

### Predicted value:
Given the size and polarizability of the molecule, the predicted molar refractivity is **~150.0**. 

(Note: Without exact calculations or a model, this is an educated estimate based on the examples. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the exact contributions of each functional group and ring system.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 73.8
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with sulfur and nitrogen) fused to a **pyrimidine-like fragment** (with N and C=O groups). This is similar to heterocyclic systems in the examples that often have moderate to high property values (e.g., 50–90).
2. **Substituents**:
   - A **thioether (S-CH3)** group, which is somewhat polar but not highly polarizable.
   - A **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - A **secondary amide (N-H)** and a **carbonyl (C=O)** group, both of which are polar and can contribute to higher property values.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (71.77): This has a similar pyrimidine-like structure with an amide and NH group, yielding a high value.
- **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (71.79): Another heterocycle with multiple nitrogens and polar groups, also giving a high value.
- **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (69.56): Contains a thioether, tert-butyl, and polar N/O groups, similar to our molecule.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of **polar groups (C=O, N-H)**, **heterocyclic nitrogens**, and **moderate hydrophobicity (tert-butyl)**, the property value is likely in the **~70 range**, similar to the examples above. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: ~69.5** (likely between 69 and 72 based on analogous structures). 

A precise estimate would be **69.56**, matching the very similar example **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C**.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CC, CCCC, CCC(C)(C)C)** have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups.
2. **Aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccccc1)** alone or with simple substitutions (e.g., Cc1ccccc1) often have a value of **0.0**, but functional groups significantly increase the value.
3. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OC** has a value of **26.3**.
   - **CCCCC(=O)OCC** also has a value of **26.3**.
   - The ester group **C(=O)OC** contributes ~26.3 to the property.
4. **Aromatic esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (value = 127.79), but the latter has additional complex substituents (sulfonyl, nitroso, etc.) that inflate the value.
   - The base aromatic ester (without extra groups) should be closer to simpler esters.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an ethyl ester of benzoic acid (ethyl benzoate). It has:
- An ester group (**C(=O)OCC**), contributing ~26.3 (from aliphatic esters).
- An aromatic ring, which alone contributes 0.0, but conjugation with the ester may slightly increase the value.

From the examples:
- **CCCC(=O)OC** (methyl butanoate) = 26.3  
- **CCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl pentanoate) = 26.3  
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is analogous but with an aromatic ring. The conjugation might not drastically change the value, as seen in other aromatic esters (e.g., **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** = 34.14, which has an additional keto group).

Thus, the predicted value is likely **~26.3**, matching the trend for simple esters.

### Final Answer:

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property being predicted appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and electronic structure). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H) with no polarizable groups (e.g., double bonds, aromatic rings, halogens) tend to have a value of 0.0** (e.g., CSSC, CC(=C)C(=C)C, Cc1cccc(C)c1, CCCCCCC=C).
2. **Alkyl halides (e.g., Br, Cl) contribute significantly to the property** (e.g., CI has 0.0, but Br-substituted aromatic systems like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have 0.0 because the aromatic system dominates; however, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl also has 0.0, suggesting symmetry or cancellation effects).
3. **Long alkyl chains with polarizable termini (e.g., C=O, Br) have non-zero values** (e.g., CCCC(=O)CCC has 17.07, CCCCCCCO has 20.23).

For the molecule **CCCCCCCBr**:
- It is a linear alkyl chain (heptyl) with a bromine atom at the terminus. 
- Bromine is highly polarizable and should contribute significantly to the molar refractivity.
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - CCCCCCCO (20.23): Replacing the OH with Br (which is more polarizable) might slightly increase the value, but the examples suggest Br in non-aromatic systems adds ~17-20 (e.g., C=CCS(=O)SCC=C has 17.07, similar to CCCC(=O)CCC).
  - No exact match, but the closest is CCCCCCCO (20.23). Br is more polarizable than OH, but the difference may not be drastic.

Given the examples, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 20.23** (similar to CCCCCCCO, as Br and OH are both polarizable termini). 

However, if we consider that Br is significantly more polarizable than OH, the value might be slightly higher (e.g., ~22-25), but none of the examples support this directly. Thus, sticking to the closest analog (CCCCCCCO), **20.23** is the safest prediction. 

(Note: If the property is something else, the reasoning would differ, but molar refractivity fits the given data best.) 

**Final answer: 20.23**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CO (methanol)**, I can predict the property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **CO (methanol)** is a small, polar molecule with a hydroxyl group (-OH). 
2. Looking at similar small alcohols or oxygen-containing molecules in the dataset:
   - **CCC(C)CO** (2-methyl-1-propanol) has a value of **20.23**.
   - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutanol) also has a value of **20.23**.
   - **CCCCO** (1-butanol) has a value of **20.23**.
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O** (a sugar-like molecule with multiple -OH groups) has a much higher value of **110.38**, but this is due to its larger size and multiple polar groups.
3. Methanol (**CO**) is smaller than these examples but has a similar polar -OH group. Smaller alcohols like methanol typically exhibit lower values than larger alcohols, but the dataset does not include methanol explicitly. However, the trend suggests that small alcohols with one -OH group tend to cluster around **20.23** or slightly lower.
4. The simplest alcohol in the dataset is **CCC(C)(C)CC** (a branched alkane with no -OH group), which has a value of **0.0**, confirming that the -OH group contributes significantly to the property.

Given this, the most reasonable prediction for **CO (methanol)** is **20.23**, aligning with the trend for small alcohols in the dataset.
