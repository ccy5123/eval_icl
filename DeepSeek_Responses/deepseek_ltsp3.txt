SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1042.3948101001924
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples, I notice that the property values seem to cluster around certain numbers, and some structural patterns correlate with specific values. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (which is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid, specifically methyl decanoate), I observe that:

1. Long aliphatic chains (especially with terminal -OH or -O- groups) tend to have the value **1214.08336706** (e.g., `CCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)C`, `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `CCC1CCCCC1`, etc.).
2. Esters or carbonyl-containing long chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) are structurally similar but not identical to these. The closest example is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (which is methyl decanoate), but this exact structure isn't in the training set. However, `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl laurate) is given with a value of **1068.80843425**.

Given that `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is a methyl ester of a slightly shorter chain (decanoate vs. laurate), the value might be slightly lower than **1068.80843425**, but the pattern isn't perfectly clear. 

However, another ester example, `CCOC(=O)CC`, has a value of **836.36854175**, which is much lower. This suggests that the property may not scale linearly with chain length or functional groups. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest prediction is to assign the value of the most structurally similar example, which is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl laurate) at **1068.80843425**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is:  
**1068.80843425**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that certain molecular fragments or functional groups tend to correlate with specific property values. Here are some key observations:

1. **Chlorinated aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`) often have the property value **-674.49075948**.
2. **Uracil-like or cyclic imide structures** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1`, `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1`) also frequently have the value **-674.49075948**.
3. **Simple aliphatic alcohols or ethers** (e.g., `CCC(O)CC`, `CO`, `CCCOCCC`) tend to have the value **1214.08336706**.
4. **Aromatic systems with nitrogen** (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1`, `Cc1ccccc1N`) often have the value **-404.69445569**.

The molecule in question is:  
**`Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`**

### Analysis of the molecule:
- It contains a **chlorinated benzene ring** (`Clc2ccc...`), which is a chlorinated aromatic system.
- It also has a **lactam-like structure** (`oc(=O)[nH]c1`), resembling cyclic imides or uracil derivatives, which are associated with **-674.49075948** in the examples.

Given that both the chlorinated aromatic and the cyclic imide-like fragments appear in other molecules with the value **-674.49075948**, this is the most likely property for this molecule.

### Predicted property value:  
**-674.49075948**

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, **-44.96605063**, and others. These likely correspond to specific structural or functional group patterns.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro compounds (R-NO₂)**:
   - The molecule `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) and a property value of **269.79630379**.
   - The molecule `CCN2c1nc(C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` (which has a nitro-like amide but not a pure nitro group) has a value of **-170.8709924**.

2. **Aliphatic nitro compounds**:
   - The given molecule `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is a simple aliphatic nitro compound (isopropyl nitro group). 

3. **Other nitro-containing molecules**:
   - No other simple aliphatic nitro compounds are present in the examples, but the presence of the nitro group seems to correlate with values around **269.79630379** (as in `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO`).

4. **Non-nitro aliphatic compounds**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC(C)CC`, `CCCCCl`) have a value of **1214.08336706**, but these lack the nitro group.

### Prediction:
Since `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is an aliphatic nitro compound, the closest analog in the examples is `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO`, which has a value of **269.79630379**. The nitro group appears to be the dominant feature influencing this value, even though the rest of the structure differs.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is:

**269.79630379**

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 854.3549620036873
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, branching, and substituents. The molecule in question is a complex steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group. 

Comparing it to similar complex molecules in the dataset:
- **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** has a property value of **854.354962**. This is a steroid-like structure with a carbonyl group and multiple rings, similar to the given molecule but slightly less complex.
- **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO** has an additional hydroxyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, increasing its complexity slightly.

Given this, the predicted property value for **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO** would be slightly higher than **854.354962**, likely in the range of **870-900**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 880.0**  

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or additional context on how the property is calculated, this is an approximate estimate based on structural similarity to the provided examples.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **High values (~1214.08336706)**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCBr, CCCCCCC(C)O, CNN).
   - No aromatic rings or complex functional groups.
   - Halogens (Br, Cl) in simple aliphatic contexts.

2. **Negative or low values**:
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, OH, O, N).
   - Molecules with multiple halogens or heteroatoms (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, CN(C)c1ccccc1).
   - Conjugated systems or fused rings (e.g., c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13).

3. **Intermediate values**:
   - Somewhat complex structures with mixed aliphatic/aromatic features (e.g., CCCCCc1ccccc1: 183.95202531).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** has:
- Two aromatic rings (fluorinated phenyl and chlorinated phenyl).
- Polar functional groups: C=O, NH, and Cl/F substituents.
- Conjugated amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N).

This structure resembles examples like:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-674.49075948)
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-674.49075948)
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-674.49075948)

All these have aromatic rings with polar substituents and give **-674.49075948**. The target molecule is even more polar/complex, but the value seems to cluster around this range for such features.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-674.49075948** (same as other aromatic/polar examples).

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **1214.08336706**, which appears frequently for relatively simple aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers. 

For the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), which is a simple aliphatic ether with no significant functional groups or complex substituents, the property value is likely to align with the recurring value seen for similar structures (e.g., **CCOC(=O)CC**, **CCCCCO**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, etc.). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is:  
**1214.08336706**  

This follows the pattern where simple hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers without strongly polar or conjugated systems default to this value.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 374.7170885981085
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to follow certain patterns based on molecular features:

1. Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g., hexachlorobenzene derivatives) consistently show the value -674.49075948
2. Simple aliphatic compounds (especially those with C-C, C-H, C-O bonds) often show 1214.08336706
3. Compounds with both aromatic and aliphatic character tend to have intermediate values
4. Bromine substitution appears to reduce the magnitude compared to chlorine analogs
5. Carbonyl groups (especially in rings) and nitrogen heterocycles tend to produce negative values

For the target molecule: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O

Key features:
- Aliphatic CCC(C) group (would suggest higher positive value)
- Bromine substitution (reduces magnitude)
- Two carbonyl groups in a nitrogen-containing ring (suggests negative value)
- Similar to some of the intermediate examples with both aliphatic and heterocyclic components

Looking at comparable structures:
- CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has -438.41899366
- CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2 has -438.41899366
- The bromine substitution and carbonyl groups are similar

However, our target has more aliphatic character (CCC group) which would push the value toward positive, but the two carbonyls and nitrogen heterocycle would push it negative. The bromine reduces the negative impact compared to chlorine.

Considering all these factors, the most reasonable prediction would be between -200 and -400. Looking at the examples, the closest match would be:

Predicted property value: -269.79630379

This matches the magnitude of similar compounds while accounting for the mixed aliphatic/heterocyclic nature and bromine substitution.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property values seem to cluster around certain numbers, with some clear patterns:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCCCC, C1CCc2ccccc2C1) tend to have positive values around 80-1214
2. Aromatic systems with multiple fused rings (e.g., c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67) consistently show -674.49075948
3. Biphenyl-like structures (e.g., Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34) also show -674.49075948

The molecule in question, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 (biphenyl), is structurally similar to several examples that all have the property value -674.49075948. This appears to be a characteristic value for conjugated aromatic systems with two connected phenyl rings.

Given this pattern, I predict the property value for biphenyl is:

-674.49075948

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, **584.55865821**, and others. These likely correspond to specific structural or functional group patterns.  

### Observations:
1. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., cycloalkanes, branched alkanes)** often have the value **1214.08336706**:
   - `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` → 1214.08336706  
   - `CC(C)I` → 1214.08336706  
   - `CCC1CCCCC1` → 1214.08336706  
   - `OC1CCCCCCC1` → 1214.08336706  

2. **Aromatic systems with halogens (Cl/Br) or nitro groups** frequently have **-674.49075948**:
   - `Brc1cccc2ccccc12` → -674.49075948  
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` → -674.49075948  
   - `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` → -674.49075948  

3. **Molecules with sulfur (S) in non-aromatic contexts** sometimes have intermediate values (e.g., **584.55865821**, **836.36854175**):
   - `CCNC(=S)NCC` → 836.36854175  
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` → 584.55865821  

### Prediction for `CCCCS`:
- The molecule is a **linear aliphatic thiol (butyl mercaptan)** with no aromaticity or halogens.  
- It resembles aliphatic hydrocarbons but contains a sulfur atom, which may shift the property away from **1214.08336706** but not toward the strongly negative values seen with aromatics/halogens.  
- Given the examples with sulfur (`CCNC(=S)NCC` → 836.36854175, `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` → 584.55865821), I predict a **positive value in the range of ~500–800**.  

### Final Prediction:
**584.55865821** (This matches the pattern of aliphatic sulfur-containing molecules like `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O`.)  

Thus, the predicted property for `CCCCS` is:  
**584.55865821**

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, with the most frequent being **-674.49075948** and **1214.08336706**. 

Key observations:
1. **1214.08336706** appears frequently for:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C`, `CC(C)CC(C)O`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `BrC(Br)Br`).
   - Alcohols with small alkyl groups (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O`).
   - Halogenated small alkanes (e.g., `ClCC(Cl)Cl`).
   - Ethers (e.g., `CCCCOC`).

2. The molecule `CCCC(C)(C)CO` is a branched alcohol with a structure similar to many of the examples that have the property value **1214.08336706** (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O`, `CCC(C)(O)CC`).

Given this pattern, the predicted property value for `CCCC(C)(C)CO` is:

**1214.08336706**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -502.8022025189165
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., c1ccccc1, Cc1ccccc1) tend to have negative values around -200 to -674.
2. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1) have moderately negative values.
3. Halogenated compounds (especially with Cl, Br, I) often have the value 1214.08336706.
4. Compounds with multiple fused rings tend to have values between -200 and -674.

The molecule in question, Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (2-methylnaphthalene), is a naphthalene derivative with one methyl group. Looking at similar structures:

- c1ccccc1 (benzene): -674.49075948
- Cc1ccccc1 (toluene): -202.34722784
- Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (naphthalene derivative) should be similar to other fused ring systems

Comparing with:
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (methyl-substituted naphthalene): -359.72840505
- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene): -548.58581771

The value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would likely be between these, closer to the naphthalene derivative. A reasonable prediction would be:

**-359.72840505** (same as the similar methylnaphthalene structure in the examples)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 427.17748100184366
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948** and **1214.08336706**, with some intermediate values. The property appears to be influenced by structural features such as:

1. **Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br, I) or nitro groups (NO₂)** tend to have the value **-674.49075948**.
2. **Small aliphatic or non-aromatic molecules (e.g., CC(C)C, ClCCl, CCCCCO)** tend to have the value **1214.08336706**.
3. **Molecules with conjugated systems, carbonyls, or heterocycles** have intermediate values (e.g., **33.72453797**, **854.354962**, **-404.69445569**).

The molecule in question is:  
**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**

### Structural Analysis:
- It contains a **cyclic imide core (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1)** with an aliphatic side chain **(C(C)CCC)** and an **alkene (CC=C)**.
- It lacks aromaticity or halogens but has multiple carbonyl groups and a heterocyclic (imide) structure.
- Similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** with **33.72453797**) suggest that this structural motif leads to **small positive or near-zero values**.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (33.72453797)**, but with a slightly larger aliphatic side chain **(C(C)CCC)**, the property value is likely in the same range but adjusted slightly due to the increased hydrophobicity/bulk.

### Final Prediction:
**~50.0** (a slight increase from **33.72453797** due to the extended side chain).  

However, since the dataset does not show strict linear trends for side-chain extensions, the closest match remains **33.72453797**. Thus, the predicted value is:

**33.72453797** (same as the closest analogous example).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarity.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -404.6944556859571
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to follow certain patterns based on molecular features:

1. **Simple alkanes/ethers/alcohols** (e.g., CCCC, CCO, C1CCCC1, CSSC, CC(C)CCO) consistently have a value of **1214.08336706**, suggesting this is a baseline for small, non-aromatic, non-halogenated hydrocarbons or their derivatives.

2. **Aromatic rings without halogens** (e.g., CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, CCc1ccccc1CC) have values around **80.93889114**, indicating that aromaticity alone reduces the baseline value significantly.

3. **Halogenated aromatics** (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) consistently have a value of **-674.49075948**, suggesting halogens on aromatic rings drastically lower the property value.

4. **Highly fluorinated or perhalogenated compounds** are not explicitly in the examples, but fluorine is a halogen, and the trend suggests halogenated aromatics have strongly negative values.

Given the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (benzene substituted with a trifluoromethyl group, CF3-Ph):
- It is an aromatic ring with a highly fluorinated substituent (CF3).
- The CF3 group is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to other halogens on aromatics.
- The examples show that halogenated aromatics (Cl, I, etc.) have a value of **-674.49075948**, and there is no reason to expect fluorine to deviate significantly from this trend.

Thus, the predicted property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-674.49075948**

True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Notably, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`) or polyol structures tend to have a property value of **1214.08336706**. Examples include:

- `CC(C)CCCO` (1214.08336706)  
- `CC(C)C(C)O` (1214.08336706)  
- `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (1214.08336706)  
- `CCC(C)(O)CC` (1214.08336706)  
- `CCCCCC(C)C` (1214.08336706)  

The molecule in question, `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`, is a cyclic polyol (a sugar-like structure with five hydroxyl groups). This aligns closely with the examples above, which are also polyols or highly oxygenated structures. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` is:

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 639.2999372430337
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some patterns:

1. **High positive values (~1214.08336706)** are associated with small, simple, or highly halogenated (especially chlorine or bromine) molecules (e.g., `CI`, `BrCCBr`, `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...`, `CCC(C)(C)CC`, `C1CCOC1`).
2. **Negative values (~-674.49075948)** are often seen in aromatic or conjugated systems with heteroatoms (e.g., `c1ccncc1`, `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`, `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`).
3. **Intermediate positive values** are associated with larger, more complex structures, especially those with carbonyls, rings, or sulfur/phosphorus (e.g., `CCCC(=O)CCCC` = 1004.24179744, `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` = 1079.18521516).
4. **Steroids or polycyclic structures** with carbonyls and hydroxyls tend to have values in the range of ~800-1000 (e.g., `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` = 930.79724808).

### Target Molecule:
`CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`

This is a **polycyclic steroid-like structure** with multiple carbonyls (`C=O`), hydroxyls (`OH`), and a conjugated system (`C=CC`). Comparing to similar examples:
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (steroid with carbonyl and hydroxyl) = 930.79724808.
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid with ester and carbonyl) = 870.70625314.

The target molecule is more oxidized (more carbonyls and hydroxyls) and has a conjugated double bond, which might slightly lower the value compared to the simpler steroid examples. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity and trends, I predict a value in the range of **~850-950**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted value: 890.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

These values seem to correlate with specific structural motifs or functional groups.

### Key Observations:
1. **-674.49075948**: Frequently appears for molecules with aromatic rings (especially halogenated aromatics, e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, `Oc1ccccc1Cl`), as well as some heterocycles (e.g., `c2cnc1ncncc1n2`). This suggests a strong association with conjugated/aromatic systems, often with halogens or electronegative substituents.
2. **1214.08336706**: Associated with aliphatic structures containing halogens (e.g., `ClCCl`), ethers (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`), or bulky non-aromatic groups (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O`). This may correspond to a steric or topological property.
3. **584.55865821**: Seen in molecules with fused ring systems or cyclic ketones (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`, `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`). This suggests a link to cyclic/rigid structures with carbonyl groups.
4. **-529.21582667**: Occurs for fused aromatic systems (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`) or structures with multiple aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O`).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule in question is:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**

- **Structure**: This is a **steroid-like fused polycyclic system** with a ketone (`C=O`) and a hydroxyl group (`OH`). It has four fused rings (3 six-membered and 1 five-membered), resembling steroidal or terpenoid frameworks.
- **Analogous Examples**:  
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property = **584.55865821**) is a similar fused polycycle with hydroxyl and aromatic groups.  
  - `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` (property = **584.55865821**) has a cyclic ketone and amide groups.  

Given the presence of a fused ring system, a ketone, and a hydroxyl group, the most plausible property value is **584.55865821**, as this aligns with the recurring pattern for such rigid, polycyclic structures.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 584.55865821**
==================================================
Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -438.4189936597869
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (-NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12`) consistently have a property value of **-674.49075948**.
   - The nitro group seems to strongly influence the property toward this negative value when attached to an aromatic ring.

2. **Amide Groups (-CONH-)**: 
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1`) have positive values, but the exact impact depends on the rest of the structure.
   - In `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1`, the amide is attached to an aromatic ring, but no exact match is present in the examples.

3. **Combination of Amide and Nitro on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has both an amide (`CC(=O)N-`) and a nitro (`N(=O)=O`) group attached to the same benzene ring.
   - This is similar to `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene, property = -674.49075948) but with an additional amide substituent.

4. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Adding an electron-withdrawing group (like amide) to nitrobenzene might not drastically change the property, as the nitro group already dominates the electronic properties.
   - No examples show a nitro + amide combination, but the nitro group's influence seems stronger.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the nitro group in setting the property to **-674.49075948** in similar structures, and the lack of examples where an additional amide group significantly alters this, the most reasonable prediction is that the property for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is:

**-674.49075948**  

This aligns with the consistent trend observed for nitro-substituted aromatic compounds in the provided data.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 112.41512657943255
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly for molecules with specific functional groups or structural motifs. Here are some key observations:

1. **Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br) or nitro groups (NO2)** tend to have a property value of **-674.49075948**.
   - Examples: `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`, `Brc1cccc2ccccc12`, `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, etc.

2. **Simple aliphatic chains or alcohols** often have a property value of **1214.08336706**.
   - Examples: `CCCO`, `CC(C)Cl`, `CCCC(C)O`, `CCCCCCCO`, etc.

3. **Aromatic rings with oxygen-containing groups (e.g., OH, OCH3)** or **heterocycles** often have values like **-404.69445569** or **-438.41899366**.
   - Examples: `OCc1ccccc1` (-404.69445569), `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (-404.69445569), `O=Cc2ccc1OCOc1c2` (-438.41899366).

4. **Molecules with C#N (nitriles)** or **C#C (alkynes)** often have higher positive values like **584.55865821** or **269.79630379**.
   - Examples: `CCC#N` (584.55865821), `CC#N` (269.79630379), `CCC#CCC` (584.55865821).

5. **Molecules with complex fused ring systems or carbonyl groups** have intermediate values (e.g., **717.09017586**, **816.4888141**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule to predict is:
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`

Breaking this down:
- It contains a **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)`), which is not explicitly present in the examples.
- It has an **aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent** (`cc(Cl)ccc`), which is associated with **-674.49075948** in the examples.
- It also has an **aliphatic chain (`CCO`) and a heterocycle (`n1c(=O)oc2`)**, which might suggest contributions from other categories.

However, the presence of the **Cl-substituted aromatic ring** is a dominant feature in the examples, and all such molecules have the value **-674.49075948**. The additional structural complexity (phosphorothioate, heterocycle) does not appear to significantly alter this value in the given examples (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` still has -674.49075948 despite high complexity).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong consistency for Cl-substituted aromatics, the most likely property value is:
**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value **1214.08336706** appears frequently for molecules with certain structural features:

1. **Simple aliphatic alcohols** (e.g., `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)CO`, `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`) consistently have this value.
2. **Small alkanes or halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `CCC`, `ClCC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `CI`) also share this value.
3. The presence of **multiple hydroxyl groups** or **halogens** in a non-aromatic, non-conjugated system tends to correlate with this property.

The molecule in question, **CC(C)(C)CO**, is a **tertiary alcohol** (specifically, **2-methyl-2-propanol**, or *tert-butanol*). It fits the pattern of simple aliphatic alcohols that consistently have the property value **1214.08336706**.

### Predicted Property Value:

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, and a few others. These values appear to correlate with specific structural features or functional groups in the molecules.

For the molecule in question:  
**O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**  

This is a **purine-like heterocycle** with multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). Many of the molecules in the examples with **-674.49075948** share similar features:  
- Aromatic nitrogen-containing rings (e.g., pyridine, imidazole, or fused systems).  
- Substituents like carbonyls or hydroxyl groups.  

Examples with this value include:  
- **Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2** (fused aromatic system with N and O)  
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (imidazole-like with C=O and N)  
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (similar N-heterocycle with C=O)  

Given the structural similarity of **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** to these molecules, the predicted property value is:  

**-674.49075948**  

This matches the recurring pattern observed for such nitrogen-rich heterocycles with carbonyl groups.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 741.9398354242546
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains or alcohols** (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)O`, `CCCCCCCO`) tend to have the property value **1214.08336706**.
2. **Aromatic or conjugated systems** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tend to have the property value **-674.49075948**.
3. **Molecules with esters or carbonyls in flexible aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC`, `CCCOC(C)C`) also tend to have the property value **1214.08336706**.
4. **Molecules with mixed features** (e.g., branching, heteroatoms, or partial unsaturation) may have intermediate values (e.g., `CCOC=C` has **269.79630379**).

### Analysis of the target molecule: `CC(C)OC=O`
- This is an ester (methyl acetate-like structure) with a branched aliphatic chain (`CC(C)`). 
- The presence of the `OC=O` (ester) group and the aliphatic `CC(C)` moiety suggests similarity to molecules like `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` or `CCCOC(C)C`, which have the property value **1214.08336706**.
- There is no aromaticity or extended conjugation that would suggest a value of **-674.49075948** or other negative values.

### Prediction:
The most likely property value for `CC(C)OC=O` is **1214.08336706**.

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs):**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and strong EWGs (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂, C=O) tend to have **negative property values**, often around **-674.49075948**.
   - Examples:
     - `Oc1ccccc1Cl`: -674.49075948  
     - `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`: -674.49075948  
     - `c1ccncc1`: -674.49075948  
     - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`: -674.49075948  

2. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs) or Neutral Substituents:**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and EDGs (e.g., NH₂, OH, alkyl groups) or neutral substituents tend to have **less negative or positive values**.
   - Examples:
     - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: -404.69445569  
     - `Cc1cccc2ccccc12`: -502.80220252  

3. **Amide or Urea-Like Structures:**
   - Molecules with amide or urea-like linkages (e.g., `NC(=O)N`, `O=C(N)`) often have **intermediate negative values**.
   - Example:
     - `NC(=S)N`: -674.49075948 (but this is a thiourea, not directly comparable).  
     - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1`: -107.91852152 (amide with aromatic ring).  

4. **Specific Case of `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`:**
   - This is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms (`N-phenyl-N'-phenylurea`).
   - The structure is aromatic-heavy with no strong EWGs (only the urea C=O is weakly electron-withdrawing).
   - The phenyl rings are neutral/weakly donating, and the urea linkage is polar but not strongly withdrawing like halogens or nitro groups.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (amide with aromatic ring): **-107.91852152**  
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (aromatic amide with pyridine): **-674.49075948** (but pyridine is more electron-withdrawing than phenyl).  

Given that `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` has two phenyl rings and a urea linkage, it is **less electron-deficient** than molecules with halogens or nitro groups but more polar than simple hydrocarbons.  

### Predicted Property:
The value is likely **less negative** than -674.49075948 but not as high as purely aliphatic molecules (which are positive). A reasonable estimate is:  
**-107.91852152** (similar to `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1`, another aromatic amide/urea-like structure).  

### Final Answer:
**-107.91852152**
==================================================
Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -529.2158266662517
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the structure of the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, we can analyze the pattern of the property values:

1. **Aromatic systems with fused rings or extended conjugation** tend to have property values around **-674.49075948**. Examples:
   - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -674.49075948  
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`: -674.49075948  
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`: -674.49075948  
   - `Fc1cccc(F)c1`: -674.49075948  
   - `Sc1ccccc1`: -674.49075948  
   - `Brc1ccccc1`: -674.49075948  

2. The given molecule (**C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**) is a **fluorene** derivative (tricyclic aromatic system with two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring). This structure is highly conjugated and resembles other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the dataset that have the value **-674.49075948**.

3. No other structural features (e.g., polar substituents, halogens, or heteroatoms) are present to suggest a deviation from this trend.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 24
SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, **-44.96605063**, and others. These likely correspond to specific structural or functional group patterns. 

For the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's break it down structurally:
1. It contains a **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)** and a **guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N)**, both of which are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
2. The aromatic ring has an **amine substituent (N)**, adding to its polarity.
3. The molecule lacks long aliphatic chains or halogen clusters (Cl/Br), which are associated with extreme values like 1214.08336706 or -674.49075948 in the examples.

Looking at similar polar, nitrogen/sulfur-containing molecules in the dataset:
- **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (a cyclic urea/imide) has a value of **-674.49075948**, but this seems tied to its cyclic conjugated system.
- **CNN** (a simple hydrazine derivative) has **1214.08336706**, but this is likely an outlier for small N-containing compounds.
- **N(COC)C(=O)CCl** in one molecule gives **269.79630379**, closer to polar functional groups.

The sulfonamide + guanidine combination suggests moderate polarity without extreme features. A reasonable estimate is **-44.96605063**, as this value appears for diverse polar molecules (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**, **Cc1cc(C)cc(C)c1**).

**Final predicted property value: -44.96605063**

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 51.883904575122735
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **-674.49075948**, **-202.34722784**, **80.93889114**, **1214.08336706**, and others. The property appears to be influenced by structural features like aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, carbonyls), and molecular size.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

Key structural features:
1. **Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** – Present in multiple examples with negative property values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → **-674.49075948**).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)** – Halogens (especially multiple fluorines) often correlate with negative values.
3. **Aromatic ring with substitutions** – Similar to other nitro-aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` → **-548.58581771**).
4. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))** – Neutral or slightly positive influence, but likely outweighed by strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → **-674.49075948** (single nitro + phenol).
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` → **-548.58581771** (two nitro groups + complex heterocycle).
- `Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl` → **-674.49075948** (nitro-like groups + halogen).

The target molecule has **two nitro groups + a CF3 group**, which are strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to some of the most negative examples. However, the presence of a flexible amine side chain might slightly moderate the effect compared to purely rigid aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing groups and aromaticity, the value is likely close to other nitro-aromatics. The closest analog is the molecule with two nitro groups and a halogen (**-548.58581771**), but the CF3 group is even more electron-withdrawing than Cl, so the value could be more negative.

**Final Prediction: -674.49075948**  
*(This matches the recurring value for highly electron-deficient aromatic systems, even though the exact structure differs slightly.)*

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 741.9398354242546
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **High value (~1214.08336706)** appears for:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCC, C1CCCCCCC1)
   - Alcohols (e.g., CCCCCCCCO, OC1CCCCCC1)
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClC(Cl)Cl, BrCBr)
   - Ethers (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC)
   - Polyols (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO)

2. **Intermediate values (e.g., 899.32101264, 741.93983542)** appear for:
   - Aldehydes/ketones (e.g., O=C1CCCCC1, CCCC=O)
   - Esters (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O)

3. **Negative or low values** appear for:
   - Aromatic compounds (e.g., c1ccccc1, Clc1ccccc1)
   - Compounds with conjugated systems (e.g., C=CC=C)
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., c2ccc1scnc1c2)

The molecule in question is **CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate). This is an ester, structurally similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (value: 899.32101264) and **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (value: 944.28706327). 

Given that **CC(C)OC=O** is a smaller ester than these examples, its value would likely be slightly lower than 899.32101264. 

### Predicted value: **~850.0** (estimated based on ester trend) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -202.34722784297855
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, **-404.69445569**, and **-422.68087594**, among others. These likely correspond to specific structural or functional group patterns.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with hydroxyl (-OH) groups** often have property values around **-422.68087594** (e.g., `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` and `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O`).
2. **Simple alkyl-substituted aromatics** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`) tend to have values around **-44.96605063**.
3. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatics** consistently show **-674.49075948**.
4. **Small aliphatic molecules (e.g., CO, CCI, C1CCOC1)** have **1214.08336706**.

### Target Molecule: `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`
- This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (toluene derivative with an -OH group).
- It has:
  - An aromatic ring.
  - Two methyl groups (`Cc1cc(C)...`).
  - One hydroxyl group (`...cc(O)c1`).

### Closest Matches:
1. `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O` has **-422.68087594**, but it has additional complex substituents.
2. `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (a trihydroxybenzoate) has **-438.41899366**, but this is more polar.
3. `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (methyl-substituted aniline) has **-404.69445569**, which is closer but lacks the -OH group.

Given that the target molecule is **less polar** than trihydroxybenzenes but **more polar** than simple alkyl benzenes, and considering the hydroxyl group's influence, a reasonable estimate is between **-404.69445569** (methylaniline) and **-422.68087594** (hydroxy-substituted aromatics).

### Predicted Property Value:
**-422.68087594** (due to the hydroxyl group's dominant effect, similar to other hydroxylated aromatics in the dataset). 

Thus, the predicted property value for `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` is:

   - Molecules with aromatic rings, especially those substituted with halogens (Cl, Br), hydroxyl (`OH`), or nitro groups (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Also includes conjugated systems like `C=CC#N` or `C=CC=C`.

4. **Other Negative Values (~-202.34722784, ~-404.69445569)**:
   - Aromatic systems with fewer electronegative substituents or mixed aliphatic-aromatic structures (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1`, `Cc1ccccc1O`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has the following features:
- A **phosphate group** (`P(=S)(OC)O`), which is present in other molecules like `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` (property = -202.34722784).
- An **aromatic ring** with a **thioether group (`SC`)** and a **methyl group (`C`)**.
- The structure is somewhat similar to `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` (property = -202.34722784), but with `SC` and `C` instead of halogens.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the phosphate group and aromaticity (which often correlates with negative values), but with less electronegative substituents (no halogens), the property is likely **-202.34722784**, matching other phosphate-containing aromatic molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value often repeats for certain structural motifs, particularly for highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) aromatic systems. 

Key observations:
1. Many polychlorinated aromatic compounds have the value -674.49075948
   - Examples: Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (-674.49075948)
               Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (-674.49075948)
               Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-674.49075948)

2. The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl derivative with chlorine substituents on both rings, similar to the examples above.

3. The consistent value for such structures suggests this property may be related to some electronic or steric feature of heavily chlorinated aromatics.

Given this pattern, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is:

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkyl Groups**:
   - Molecules like **CCC** (propane), **CC** (ethane), **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane), and **CCCCCCCCC** (nonane) all have the **same property value: 1214.08336706**. This suggests that saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes) consistently have this high value, likely representing a baseline or reference property (e.g., boiling point, density, or a calculated molecular descriptor).

2. **Functional Groups Impact**:
   - Introducing polar or electronegative groups (e.g., **=O**, **Cl**, **Br**, **N(=O)=O**, **C#N**) tends to **decrease the property value** significantly. For example:
     - **CC(=C)C=C** (a simple alkene): -296.77593417
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): -674.49075948
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): -674.49075948
   - The **nitro group (NO2)** appears frequently in molecules with negative property values, suggesting it strongly reduces the property.

3. **Nitro-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: 342.4337702 (this is an exception, possibly due to the large size and additional substituents).
   - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: -674.49075948 (multiple nitro groups).
   - The presence of **N(=O)=O** (nitro) generally correlates with negative values unless counteracted by other structural features.

4. **CCCN(=O)=O** (Nitropropane):
   - This is a simple nitroalkane with a 3-carbon chain and one nitro group.
   - Compared to **CCC** (propane, value = 1214.08336706), adding **N(=O)=O** should drastically reduce the property.
   - Similar nitro-containing small molecules (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**) have values around **-674.49075948**, but this has multiple nitro groups.
   - **CCCN(=O)=O** is simpler, so its value might be less extreme but still negative.

### Prediction:
Given the strong reducing effect of the nitro group and the baseline of alkanes, a reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** is:
**-202.34722784** (similar to other mono-nitro compounds or halogenated molecules like **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**).

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Halogen-Substituted Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -674.49075948  
     (Chlorobenzene with a bromo substituent)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: -674.49075948  
     (Polychlorinated biphenyl)
   - **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**: -674.49075948  
     (Chlorinated heterocycle)
   - **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: -674.49075948  
     (Brominated naphthalene)

   These molecules share:
   - Aromatic rings with halogen (Cl/Br) substituents.
   - Property values clustered around **-674.49075948**.

2. **Other Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: -404.69445569  
     (Chlorinated anisole)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: -404.69445569  
     (Chlorinated anisole)
   - **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -404.69445569  
     (Nitrotoluene, not halogenated but similar aromatic substitution)

   These suggest that non-halogenated or less halogenated aromatics have higher (less negative) values.

3. **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**:
   - This is a **fluorobenzene with a bromo substituent**, structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (where Cl is replaced by F).
   - Fluorine and chlorine are both halogens, and their electronegativities are similar (F is slightly higher). The property seems dominated by the aromatic + halogen pattern rather than the specific halogen.

### Prediction:
Given the consistency of **-674.49075948** for aromatic systems with heavy halogen (Cl/Br) substitution, the value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely the same. Fluorine is also a halogen, and the aromatic + halogen pattern dominates.

### Final Answer:
**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, and others. These values seem to correlate with specific structural features or functional groups in the molecules.

Key observations:
1. **1214.08336706** appears frequently for simple aliphatic chains, alcohols (e.g., `CCCC(C)(C)O`, `CC(C)(C)CO`), ethers (e.g., `CCCOCCC`), and other non-aromatic, non-polar structures.
2. **-674.49075948** is associated with aromatic or heteroaromatic systems, especially those with multiple rings or electronegative atoms (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`, `Oc1ccccn1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`).
3. Intermediate values (e.g., **741.93983542**, **269.79630379**) are often linked to carbonyl-containing or moderately polar structures.

### Analysis of the target molecule: `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2`
- This is a **bicyclic aliphatic structure** with an alcohol group (`C(O)`).
- It lacks aromaticity or highly polar functional groups (like nitro, sulfonyl, etc.).
- The structure is most similar to aliphatic alcohols or ethers in the examples, which consistently have the property value **1214.08336706**.

### Conclusion:
The predicted property value for `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2` is:  
**1214.08336706** (same as other aliphatic/alcohol-containing molecules in the dataset).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -44.966050631773065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P(=S)) and aromatic rings**: 
   - The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a property value of **134.8981519**. This is structurally similar to the target molecule, with the main difference being the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`.
   - The `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` fragment is a phthalimide-like structure, which appears in other examples but with varying substituents.

2. **Aromatic systems and substituents**:
   - Molecules with simple aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl`) tend to have a property value of **-674.49075948**, but this seems to be a default or baseline value for unremarkable aromatic systems.
   - The presence of `P(=S)` and `OCC` (ethoxy groups) in the phosphorothioate fragment seems to elevate the property value compared to simple aromatics.

3. **Similarity to the given example**:
   - The closest match is `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a value of **134.8981519**.
   - The target molecule replaces `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, which is a slightly more complex but similarly weighted fragment (no drastic change in electronegativity or size).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity and the fact that the replacement fragment (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) is not significantly heavier or more polar than `SC(CCl)`, the property value is likely close to the example with the phosphorothioate and aromatic system. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is:

**134.8981519**

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -331.11364556123766
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic systems with heteroatoms and carbonyl groups** tend to have negative property values. For example:
   - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**: -438.41899366 (contains a similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl group and nitrogen heteroatoms).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**: 699.01769618 (though this is not negative, it has multiple carbonyls and nitrogens, but also aliphatic chains).
   - **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -674.49075948 (two aromatic rings linked by a carbonyl).

2. **Simple aliphatic chains or rings** tend to have the value **1214.08336706**, e.g., **CCCCOC**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)C**, **C1CCCCCC1**, etc.

3. The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has:
   - A fused aromatic system with two nitrogens and a carbonyl (=O).
   - A methyl group (Cc1) and another methyl group attached to nitrogen (n1C).
   - A phenyl ring (c2ccccc2) attached to one of the nitrogens.

This structure is most similar to:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property: -438.41899366), which also has a fused aromatic system with nitrogens, a carbonyl, and aromatic rings.
- **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -674.49075948), which has two aromatic rings linked by a carbonyl.

Given that **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has a more complex fused system with nitrogens and a carbonyl, its property value is likely closer to the first example (-438.41899366) rather than the simpler -674.49075948.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-438.41899366** (same as the most structurally similar example).
==================================================
Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 978.0116012410629
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **1214.08336706**, which appears frequently for relatively simple aliphatic or oxygen-containing molecules (e.g., `CCC(C)C`, `OCC(O)C(O)CO`, `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC`, `CCCCS`). This suggests that **1214.08336706** is a "default" or baseline value for many neutral, non-aromatic, or non-halogenated structures.

For the target molecule, `CCCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl hexanoate), we can break it down:
1. It is an aliphatic ester with no aromatic rings, halogens, or other complex functional groups.
2. Structurally, it resembles other simple aliphatic compounds like `CCC(=C)C` (458.65371644), but with an ester group. However, the ester group doesn't seem to drastically alter the property in other examples (e.g., `CCOC(=O)N` is 584.55865821, but `CC(=O)OC3CCC4...` is 854.354962).
3. The closest analog is `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (1025.2259544), which is methyl hexanoate. The only difference here is the ethyl group (`OCC`) instead of methyl (`OC`). The ethyl group is unlikely to cause a significant deviation from the 1000-range, but given the prevalence of **1214.08336706** for many simple aliphatics, this might override.

Given the ambiguity, I lean toward the **1214.08336706** value, as it appears most frequently for neutral, non-halogenated aliphatic molecules like this one. 

**Predicted property value: 1214.08336706**

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -438.4189936597869
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, there appears to be a pattern where certain molecular fragments or functional groups correlate with specific property values. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to the examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`COC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is methyl benzoate, with the structure: an ester (COO) attached to a benzene ring.

**Observed patterns in the examples:**
1. Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `CC(C)(C)CCO`, `CCC(C)(C)O`) consistently have the property value **1214.08336706**.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings and ester/carbonyl groups (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`, `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC`) often have the value **-254.80762025** or **458.65371644**, depending on additional substituents.
3. The molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) has the value **-254.80762025**.  
   The molecule `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` (methyl benzoate) is very similar, differing only by one fewer methylene group in the ester side chain.

Given the similarity between `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` and `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`, and the fact that the property value seems to be determined primarily by the aromatic ester functional group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` will be the same as for `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`.

**Predicted property value:**  
**-254.80762025**
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -296.7759341697019
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain patterns in the property values associated with different molecular structures. Here are some key observations:

1. **Highly positive values (e.g., 1214.08336706)** are associated with simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCC`, `C1CCCC1`, `CCC(C)(C)CC`), simple ethers (e.g., `CCCOC`), and very small/basic structures (e.g., `CBr`, `CCN(=O)=O`). These seem to be "default" high values for molecules without strong functional groups or complexity.

2. **Moderate positive values (e.g., 269.79630379, 458.65371644, 741.93983542)** are associated with structures containing halogens (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N`), conjugated systems, or cyclic structures with some functionalization.

3. **Negative values (e.g., -674.49075948, -202.34722784, -438.41899366)** are associated with aromatic systems, especially those with halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Br`, `Nc1ccccc1Cl`), heterocycles (e.g., `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`), or conjugated carbonyls/amides.

4. The molecule `C=CCC=C` is a simple conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene). It lacks aromaticity, halogens, or other functional groups that would drive the property toward negative values. It is also not as simple as the alkanes/ethers that get the highest positive values.

### Prediction:
Given that `C=CCC=C` is a conjugated hydrocarbon but not aromatic or heavily functionalized, its property value is likely to be in the **moderate positive range**. Comparing to similar structures:
- `CC/C=C/C` (a simple alkene) has a value of **458.65371644**.
- `CC(=O)C` (a simple ketone) has a value of **741.93983542**.
- `CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O)` (a conjugated ketone) has a value of **269.79630379**.

Since `C=CCC=C` is simpler than these but still conjugated, a reasonable prediction would be close to **458.65371644** (similar to `CC/C=C/C`).

### Final Answer:

==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples, I notice that the property value **1214.08336706** appears frequently for molecules with certain characteristics:

1. **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CC(C)CO`, `C1CCCCC1`, `CCCCCC(C)C`).  
2. **Highly halogenated aliphatic compounds** (e.g., `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`).  
3. **Polyols** (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO`, `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`).  

The molecule in question, **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), is a highly halogenated aliphatic compound, structurally similar to `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (which has the value **1214.08336706**).  

Additionally, other halogenated aliphatic compounds like `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSP(=S)(OCC)OCC` also share this value, further supporting the pattern.  

### Predicted Property Value for **BrC(Br)Br**:  
**1214.08336706**  

This prediction is based on the consistent appearance of this value for halogenated and simple aliphatic structures in the given examples.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 134.898151895319
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, **584.55865821**, and others. These values appear to be associated with specific structural features or functional groups in the molecules.

### Analysis of the given molecule:
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

Breaking down the structure:
1. **Phosphate-like group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a thiophosphate group with two ethoxy (OCC) substituents. Similar phosphate or thiophosphate groups in the examples (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) have property values like **197.15883739**.
2. **Thioether linkage (SC(CCl))**: A thioether with a chloroethyl group.
3. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure (a cyclic imide with a benzene ring). Similar cyclic imides or aromatic rings with carbonyl groups in the examples (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1`) have values like **-254.80762025**.

### Combining features:
- The thiophosphate group suggests a value in the range of ~197 (as seen in the example).
- The phthalimide-like structure suggests a negative value (around -254).
- The molecule is more complex than either of these alone, so the value may not be a simple average.

### Most plausible prediction:
The molecule is most similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **197.15883739**) due to the thiophosphate group and the presence of a substituted aromatic ring. The additional complexity (lactam ring) might not drastically change the order of magnitude.

Thus, the predicted property value is likely:  
**197.15883739**

True Property: 80.93889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Large positive values (~1214.08336706)** are associated with:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CCC(C)C`).
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `ClCCBr`).
   - Alcohols/ethers with long chains (e.g., `CCCOC(C)C`, `CCCC(O)CCC`).

2. **Large negative values (~-674.49075948)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`).
   - Nitro groups (e.g., `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Heterocycles (e.g., `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`).

3. **Intermediate values** (e.g., `-404.69445569`, `80.93889114`, `374.7170886`) are associated with:
   - Substituted aromatics (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1`).
   - Complex functional groups (e.g., `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** has:
- A **tertiary amide** (`CN(C)C(=O)N`).
- A **chlorinated aromatic ring** (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`).
- A **fused heterocycle** (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) with a carbonyl.
- A bulky **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`).

Given the presence of:
- Aromaticity (negative contribution).
- Chlorine substitution (often negative).
- Heterocycle with polar groups (negative or intermediate).
- Bulky aliphatic group (positive, but not enough to outweigh negatives).

### Prediction:
The molecule is complex but shares features with examples like:
- `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (-674.49075948): Aromatic + polar group.
- `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (374.7170886): Heterocycle + aliphatic.

The **chlorinated aromatic + heterocycle + bulky group** suggests a **moderately negative value**, but the bulky tert-butyl group may offset it slightly. 

Given the examples, the closest match is likely in the **intermediate negative range**, similar to molecules with nitro or heterocyclic aromatics. 

### Final Prediction:
**-404.69445569**

2. **Chlorine substitutions** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1` or `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`).  
3. **Oxygen substitutions** (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1`).  

The molecule in question:  

**`Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`**  

has:  
- Two aromatic rings connected by an oxygen (`O`).  
- Multiple chlorine (`Cl`) substitutions.  
- Hydroxyl (`OH`) groups.  

This structure closely resembles other molecules in the dataset that have the value **-674.49075948**, such as:  
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`  
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2`  
- `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`  

Thus, the predicted property value for **`Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`** is:  

**-674.49075948**

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 458.6537164440847
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to follow certain patterns based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, aromatics with no polar groups)** tend to have high positive values (e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C` = 80.93889114, `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` = 80.93889114, `CC(C)c1ccccc1C` = 80.93889114).

2. **Molecules with conjugated systems or polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, halogens)** tend to have negative values (e.g., `O=Cc1ccccc1` = -674.49075948, `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = -674.49075948).

3. **Highly halogenated or large aliphatic chains** tend to have very high positive values (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 1214.08336706, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` = 1214.08336706).

4. **Molecules with double bonds (alkenes)** seem to have higher values than simple alkanes, especially if they are part of a larger non-polar structure (e.g., `CC/C=C/C` = 458.65371644).

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C`, which is a simple alkene (2-pentene, specifically). Comparing this to similar structures:
- `CC/C=C/C` (a similar alkene) has a value of 458.65371644.
- `CCCC(C)C` (a branched alkane) has a value of 1214.08336706.
- `CC(C)C` (a simpler branched alkane) is not in the list, but `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` = 1214.08336706.

Given that `CC/C=C/C` = 458.65371644 and `CC/C=C\C` is its stereoisomer (geometric isomer), the property value is likely very similar. Stereoisomers typically have very similar physical properties unless there is significant steric or electronic difference, which is not the case here.

### Predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C`: **458.65371644** (same as `CC/C=C/C`).

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value **1214.08336706** appears frequently for simple aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, and halogenated alkanes with no strongly electronegative or conjugated systems. Examples include:

- **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) → 1214.08336706  
- **CC(C)Cl** (2-chloropropane) → 1214.08336706  
- **CCCCO** (butanol-like structure) → 1214.08336706  
- **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane) → 1214.08336706  
- **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (hexachloroethane) → 1214.08336706  
- **CCSSCC** (aliphatic disulfide) → 1214.08336706  

The molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether, C₂H₅-O-C₂H₅) fits this pattern:  
- It is a simple aliphatic ether.  
- No electronegative substituents (e.g., NO₂, C=O) or conjugated systems are present.  
- Structurally similar to other molecules with the value **1214.08336706**.  

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is:  
**1214.08336706**

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -230.1203767626031
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -674.49075948)**:
   - These are associated with molecules containing:
     - Sulfonyl groups (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)`, `S1(=O)=O`).
     - Nitro groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O`).
     - Halogens (Cl, Br) in aromatic systems.
     - Heterocycles with electronegative atoms (e.g., `n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`).
   - These features likely contribute to high polarity or strong electron-withdrawing effects.

2. **Positive Values (~ 1214.08336706)**:
   - These are associated with:
     - Simple alkanes (e.g., `C`, `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
     - Alcohols (e.g., `CC(C)(C)O`, `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`).
     - Cycloalkanes (e.g., `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`).
   - These are nonpolar or weakly polar molecules with no strong electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Intermediate Values**:
   - Values like `-404.69445569` are seen for molecules with aromatic rings and moderate polarity (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`).
   - Values like `-134.8981519` are seen for less polar aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)n1`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**

- It contains:
  - A tertiary amide group (`C(=O)N`).
  - Two aromatic rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`).
  - A bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)`).
  - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro, sulfonyl, or halogens).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analogs in the examples are:
  - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = `-404.69445569`): A biphenyl-like structure with no polar groups.
  - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (property = `-438.41899366`): Contains an amide and aromatic rings, similar to the target molecule but with an additional heterocycle.

The target molecule has:
- More steric bulk (tert-butyl group) but no additional polar/electron-withdrawing features beyond the amide.
- The amide group adds some polarity, but the bulky aromatic/tert-butyl groups reduce its impact.

### Predicted Property:
Given the absence of strong electron-withdrawing groups and the presence of bulky aromatic/tert-butyl groups, the property value should be in the intermediate range, similar to `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` but slightly more negative due to the amide group.

**Predicted Property: -438.41899366**  
(This matches the value for `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`, which is structurally similar in terms of amide + aromatic systems.)
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -438.4189936597869
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, **-44.96605063**, and **-404.69445569**, among others. These values seem to correlate with specific structural motifs or functional groups.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (Br, Cl, F)** or **heterocyclic nitrogen/oxygen** often have the property value **-674.49075948**.
   - Examples:
     - `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)` → -674.49075948  
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` → -674.49075948  
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` → -674.49075948  
     - `c2ccc1scnc1c2` → -674.49075948  

2. **Simple aliphatic chains with oxygen (e.g., alcohols, ethers)** or **phosphorus/sulfur-containing groups** often have the value **1214.08336706**.
   - Examples:
     - `CO` → 1214.08336706  
     - `CCS` → 1214.08336706  
     - `CCC(C)O` → 1214.08336706  
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 1214.08336706  

3. **Aromatic rings with alkyl substitutions (e.g., methyl groups)** often have the value **-44.96605063**.
   - Examples:
     - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` → -44.96605063  
     - `CC(=C)C(=C)C` → -44.96605063  

4. **Aromatic rings with nitrogen or oxygen substituents (e.g., -NH2, -OH)** often have the value **-404.69445569**.
   - Examples:
     - `ClCc1ccccc1` → -404.69445569  
     - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` → -404.69445569  

### Target Molecule: `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`
- This molecule consists of:
  - An **acetyl group (CC(=O))**
  - An **amide linkage (N attached to aromatic ring)**
  - A **brominated benzene ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1)**.

From the examples:
- Brominated aromatic rings (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`) have the value **-674.49075948**.
- However, the presence of the **amide group (N attached to the ring)** may shift this value toward **-404.69445569**, as seen in `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` and `ClCc1ccccc1`.

Given that the amide nitrogen is directly attached to the aromatic ring (similar to `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`), the property value is likely **-404.69445569**.

### Final Prediction:
**-404.69445569**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 80.93889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Benzene Derivatives with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N**: Property = -404.69445569
   - **Cc1ccccc1**: Not explicitly given, but similar to the above with -N replaced by -H (likely similar or slightly higher).
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**: Property = -44.96605063 (isopropylbenzene derivative).
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: Property = 80.93889114 (tert-butylbenzene derivative).
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1**: Property = -674.49075948 (styrene, conjugated system).
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1**: Property = -674.49075948 (cyano substituent, strong electron-withdrawing).
   - **Brc1ccccc1**: Property = -674.49075948 (bromobenzene, halogen substituent).

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Molecules with **CC(C)C** or similar alkyl chains (e.g., **CC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CCO**) often have the property value **1214.08336706** when the rest of the molecule is simple (e.g., alcohols or plain alkanes).
   - However, when attached to a benzene ring, the property seems to shift toward smaller or negative values (e.g., **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** = -44.96605063, **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** = 80.93889114).

3. **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
   - This is **isobutylbenzene**, where an isobutyl group (**CC(C)C**) is attached to a benzene ring.
   - Comparing to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (propylbenzene, -44.96605063) and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (tert-butylbenzene, 80.93889114), the isobutyl group is intermediate in branching.
   - The property seems to increase with branching (propyl → isobutyl → tert-butyl), but not linearly.

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- Propylbenzene (**CCc1ccc(C)cc1**): -44.96605063
- tert-Butylbenzene (**CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**): 80.93889114  
The isobutylbenzene (**CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**) is likely somewhere between these two, possibly closer to the tert-butylbenzene due to branching.

A reasonable estimate is **80.93889114** (same as tert-butylbenzene, as branching dominates over chain length).

### Final Answer:
**80.93889114**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. 

The molecule in question is **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde). 

From the examples, we see that:
- Simple aromatic compounds with a single substituent often have property values around **-674.49075948** (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`, `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`, `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O`, `c1cncnc1`).
- The presence of an aldehyde group (`O=Cc1ccccc1`) does not significantly deviate from this trend, as seen in other aromatic systems with polar substituents.

Thus, the predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is:

**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -438.4189936597869
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly -674.49075948, 1214.08336706, -404.69445569, and some other intermediate values. The property appears to be influenced by:

1. Presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often correlates with -674.49075948
2. Simple aliphatic chains often have 1214.08336706
3. Aromatic systems with oxygen substituents often show -404.69445569
4. More complex heterocyclic systems show intermediate values

The target molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two amide groups (C(=O)N)
- A fused heterocyclic system
- An aromatic ring with oxygen

Given that:
1. The nitro group would suggest -674.49075948
2. But the complex heterocyclic structure might moderate this
3. Similar complex heterocycles in the examples show intermediate values

Looking at comparable examples:
- CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 shows -230.12037676
- CCN2c1nc(C)cc(C(F)(F)F)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 shows -170.8709924
- COC1=CC(=O)CC(C)C13Oc2c(Cl)c(OC)cc(OC)c2C3=O shows 103.15741027

The target molecule is more complex than simple nitroaromatics but less complex than some steroids shown. Considering the nitro group's strong influence and the balancing effect of the heterocycle, I predict a value in the mid-range negative numbers.

Most similar example: CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 shows -422.68087594

Therefore, my predicted property value for O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is:

-422.68087594
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples, I notice that the property value often repeats for certain structural patterns. Specifically, the value **-674.49075948** appears frequently for molecules containing aromatic rings (benzene or fused aromatic systems) without significant polar or bulky substituents. 

The molecule in question is:  
**N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**  

This consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine-like linker (N-N). The structure is purely aromatic with no strongly polar or bulky substituents, similar to many of the other molecules that have the property value **-674.49075948**.  

Examples supporting this prediction:  
- **Nc1ccccc1** → -674.49075948  
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** → -674.49075948  
- **c2ccc1[nH]ncc1c2** → -674.49075948  
- **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** → -674.49075948  

Thus, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**-674.49075948**

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 505.86806960744633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Cyclic structures with amide (N-C=O) groups** often have property values in the range of **~700 to ~750** (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` has **741.93983542**, and `O=C1CCCN1` also has **741.93983542**).
2. **Lactams (cyclic amides)** or **diketopiperazine-like structures** (two amide groups in a ring) tend to have values in this range.
3. The molecule in question is a **diketopiperazine derivative** with a cyclohexane ring fused to it:
   - It has two amide (N-C=O) groups in a 6-membered ring (diketopiperazine core).
   - The cyclohexane ring is fused to this core, adding rigidity but not significantly altering the property compared to simpler diketopiperazines.

### Closest Matches:
- `O=C1CCCN1` (a simple lactam) has **741.93983542**.
- `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (a substituted diketopiperazine) also has **741.93983542**.
- The presence of the cyclohexane ring in the target molecule is unlikely to drastically change the property from these values, as the core functional groups (two amides in a ring) dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to diketopiperazines and lactams in the examples, the predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is:

**741.93983542**
==================================================
Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I notice that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **-404.69445569**, **-296.77593417**, **1214.08336706**, and others. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**  

This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with three chlorine substituents. Observing the examples:  
- **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a value of **-674.49075948**.  
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-404.69445569**.  

The given molecule has **three chlorines**, which is intermediate between these two cases. Given the trend:  
- More chlorination seems to move the value away from **-674.49075948** toward **-404.69445569**.  
- The molecule is less chlorinated than the second example but more than the first.  

Thus, a reasonable prediction would be **closer to -674.49075948** but slightly higher (less negative).  

However, since the dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene-like structures in the examples both have **-674.49075948**, I suspect this property may be **dominated by the presence of an aromatic ring with halogens**, regardless of the exact number of substitutions.  

### Final Prediction:  
**-674.49075948** (same as other chloroaromatics in the dataset).  

(Note: If this were a real-world task, I would investigate further, but based on the given examples, this is the most consistent assignment.)

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 80.93889113719145
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, with 1214.08336706 appearing frequently for various unrelated structures. This suggests the property might be something like molecular weight (though the values don't match exact molecular weights), or possibly some calculated property with arbitrary scaling.

Looking at the molecule in question: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (diethylbenzene)

This is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups. Comparing to similar structures in the examples:

1) Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline) has property = -404.69445569
2) Cc1ccccc1 (toluene) isn't shown, but similar simple aromatics with small substituents tend toward negative values
3) CCCCOC (butyl ethyl ether) has property = 1214.08336706
4) CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSC(C)(C)C (a complex organophosphate) also = 1214.08336706

The pattern seems to be:
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons with small alkyl groups tend toward negative values around -400
- More complex/aliphatic structures tend toward higher positive values
- Some very specific structures (regardless of complexity) hit exactly 1214.08336706

Since diethylbenzene is a simple aromatic with small alkyl groups (similar to methylaniline but without the polar N group), I would expect it to fall in the negative range, likely similar to methylaniline but slightly less negative due to lacking the polar nitrogen.

Most plausible prediction: -404.69445569 (same as methylaniline, since the examples show this value recurring for different structures)

However, looking at Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2 which has -359.72840505, and is more complex, perhaps -400 is too negative. 

Given the uncertainty in the pattern, my best estimate is: -404.69445569 (the recurring value for simple aromatic systems)

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that certain molecular features correlate with specific property values. Here are the key observations:

1. The value -674.49075948 appears frequently for aromatic compounds containing nitrogen heterocycles or nitro groups (e.g., Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12, Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, Oc1ccncc1).

2. The value 1214.08336706 appears for small aliphatic compounds (e.g., ClCBr, CNN, CCCCCCCCCCO) and some halogenated compounds.

3. The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O contains:
   - An aromatic ring
   - An amino group (-NH2)
   - A sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)NH2)

Comparing with similar structures in the examples:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has property -674.49075948
- Other aromatic amines/nitro compounds also show this value

The sulfonamide group is electronically similar to nitro groups in terms of being a strong electron-withdrawing group on an aromatic system. Therefore, I predict this molecule will follow the same pattern as the other aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds.

True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are the key patterns:

1. **Highly negative values (~ -674.49)** are associated with:
   - Polyhalogenated aromatic systems (e.g., Cl/Br substitutions on benzene rings)
   - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 4 or more fused rings (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`)
   - Thiophene/benzothiophene systems (e.g., `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2`)

2. **Highly positive values (~1214.08)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `C1CCCC1`, `CCCOCC`)
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., `CCCCBr`, `CCN(=O)=O`)

3. **Intermediate values** depend on functional groups and smaller aromatic systems.

The molecule in question is:  
`c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`

This is a **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)** with 4 fused benzene rings (a tetracene-like structure). Comparing this to the examples:

- `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (5-ring PAH) has a value of **-674.49075948**
- `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (4-ring PAH with a methyl group) has **-575.09212124**
- `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (3-ring PAH with a methyl group) has **-548.58581771**

The given molecule is a fully conjugated, unsubstituted 4-ring PAH, which is structurally similar to the examples with highly negative values. The absence of halogens or heteroatoms might slightly reduce the magnitude compared to the halogenated examples, but the extended conjugation and aromaticity strongly favor a large negative value.

### Predicted property value:

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -422.6808759386663
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I notice that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, **-404.69445569**, **647.5111291**, and others. These values appear to correlate with specific structural features or functional groups in the molecules. 

### Observations:
1. **1214.08336706**: This value appears frequently for simple aliphatic compounds (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `CC(C)I`, `ClCCl`, `CCCCC(C)(O)CC`, `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`). These molecules often lack aromaticity or complex conjugation.
2. **-674.49075948**: This value appears for aromatic systems, especially those with multiple rings or extended conjugation (e.g., `Fc1ccccc1`, `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`, `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`).
3. **-404.69445569**: This value appears for aromatic systems with moderate substitution (e.g., `Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`).
4. **647.5111291**: This value appears for heterocyclic systems with nitrogen and oxygen (e.g., `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C`, `CCCCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
```
This structure contains:
- A **benzofuran-like core** (`Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)`) with a ketone group.
- A **catechol-like substituent** (`c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`).
- Multiple **oxygen functionalities** (hydroxyl groups and an ether linkage).

Given the presence of **multiple aromatic rings**, **oxygen substituents**, and **conjugation**, this molecule is more complex than the simple aliphatic cases (which give 1214.08336706) but not as heavily substituted as some of the highly negative-valued cases.

### Closest Analogues:
- The **benzofuran + catechol** system resembles some of the polycyclic aromatic structures with oxygen substituents (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`, which has a value of **-563.3981638**).
- The **oxygen-rich aromatic systems** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1`, `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23`) tend to have negative values around **-500 to -700**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to oxygenated aromatic systems, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **-500 to -600**. A reasonable estimate, based on the closest examples, is:

**Predicted property value: -563.3981638**  
*(This matches the value for `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`, which has a similar level of complexity and oxygenation.)*

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 741.9398354242546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkyl Halides/Alcohols (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, CCCCO, CCCI, C1CCOC1)**:
   - These molecules consistently have a property value of **1214.08336706**, suggesting that simple hydrocarbons or their halogen/oxygen derivatives (without complex functional groups) default to this value.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Nitro Groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)**:
   - These have a property value of **-404.69445569**, indicating that nitro groups on aromatic rings contribute significantly to lowering the property value.

3. **Phosphorothioate/Phosphate Esters (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**:
   - These molecules have negative property values (e.g., **-202.34722784**, **-296.77593417**), suggesting that phosphorus-containing groups (especially with sulfur or chlorine) reduce the property value.

4. **Complex Functional Groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2, NC(=O)c1cccnc1)**:
   - These tend to have negative values (e.g., **-438.41899366**, **-674.49075948**), especially when amides, esters, or heterocycles are present.

5. **Molecules with Multiple Chlorines (e.g., Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl)**:
   - These have very negative values (e.g., **-674.49075948**), indicating that high halogen content strongly reduces the property.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- The molecule contains:
  - A **phosphate group (P=O)** with an **amide (NC(C)=O)** and a **thiol (SC)** substituent.
  - This is structurally similar to phosphorothioate esters (like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a value of **-202.34722784**), but with an amide instead of an aromatic chloro group.
  - The presence of the amide (NC(C)=O) and thiol (SC) suggests additional polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which may further reduce the property value compared to simpler phosphorothioates.

### Prediction:
Given the complexity (phosphate + amide + thiol) and similarity to phosphorothioate esters (which have negative values), the property value is likely in the range of **-200 to -400**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -296.77593417**  
(This matches the value seen for other moderately complex phosphorus-containing molecules like COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property values seem to follow certain patterns based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes and alcohols (e.g., CCCCCO, CCC(C)C, CCBr) consistently have the value 1214.08336706
2. Aromatic compounds with halogens (especially chlorine) often have the value -674.49075948
3. Compounds with C=C double bonds tend to have values around 584-674 range
4. The presence of chlorine atoms appears to significantly lower the property value

For the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl (1,2-dichloroethene):
- It contains a C=C double bond
- It has two chlorine atoms
- It's a small, simple structure similar to some of the halogenated compounds in the examples

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl: -674.49075948
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl: -674.49075948
- Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -674.49075948

The presence of two chlorines on a small hydrocarbon framework suggests this molecule would follow the same pattern as other small chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, my predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is: -674.49075948

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Heterocycles**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic heterocycles (e.g., containing nitrogen) often have negative property values. For example:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): -404.69445569
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a purine derivative): -404.69445569
     - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (a triazole derivative): -404.69445569
   - These suggest that aromatic nitrogen-containing rings tend to have property values around **-400 to -500**.

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly in the examples, but substituted benzenes with electronegative groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl) have very negative values (e.g., **-674.49075948** for **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1**).
   - Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is analogous to benzene but with a nitrogen atom, which would likely make its property value more negative than benzene but less negative than heavily substituted aromatics.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): -404.69445569
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: 134.8981519 (this is an outlier due to the complex substituents).
   - Pyridine is simpler than N-methylaniline but still aromatic with a nitrogen, so its value should be in the same ballpark.

### Prediction:
Given that pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen, its property value is likely similar to other simple nitrogen-containing aromatics in the dataset, such as **CNc1ccccc1** (-404.69445569) or **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (-404.69445569). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is:

**-404.69445569**

4. **Value ~-404.69445569**: 
   - Monocyclic aromatic systems with simple substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1Cl`, `Cc1cccc(O)c1`).

5. **Other values**: 
   - Depend on specific combinations of functional groups (e.g., esters, amides, halogens, etc.).

### Given Molecule: `OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`
- **Structural Features**:
   - Polycyclic aromatic system (`c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`).
   - Aromatic ring with substituents (`c1ccccc1N`).

   - Chlorine substituent (`Cl`).

- **Key Observations**:
  - The presence of a polycyclic aromatic system with a chlorine substituent strongly resembles examples with the value **-674.49075948**.
  - The ester and hydroxyl groups do not appear to override the dominant influence of the polycyclic aromatic system (as seen in other examples where polycyclic systems consistently yield ~-674.49075948 regardless of other functional groups).

### Predicted Property:
The molecule's property is most likely **-674.49075948**, as it matches the pattern for polycyclic aromatic systems with heteroatoms/halogens.
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, often associated with specific structural features or functional groups. Here are some key observations:

1. **Aliphatic chains with simple terminal groups (e.g., OH, Cl, I, Br)** often have the property value **1214.08336706**. Examples:
   - `CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O` → 1214.08336706
   - `CSSC` → 1214.08336706
   - `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl` → 1214.08336706
   - `CCC(C)Cl` → 1214.08336706
   - `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` → 1214.08336706

   - `CCCc1ccccc1` → -44.96605063
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` → -44.96605063

4. **Molecules with amide or ester linkages** often have intermediate values (e.g., **80.93889114**, **584.55865821**, etc.), but these depend heavily on the rest of the structure.

### Prediction for `CCCCCO`:
The molecule `CCCCCO` is a simple aliphatic alcohol (1-pentanol). Based on the examples, **simple aliphatic chains with a terminal OH group** consistently have the property value **1214.08336706**. For instance:
- `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cyclohexanol derivative) → 1214.08336706
- `CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O` (tertiary alcohol) → 1214.08336706

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCO` is:

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -202.34722784297855
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, and a few others like **458.65371644**, **80.93889114**, etc. These values seem to correlate with specific structural or functional group patterns:

1. **-674.49075948**: This value appears frequently for aromatic systems, especially those with heteroatoms (N, O, S, halogens) or conjugated systems. Examples include:
   - `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` (thiophene with nitrogen and sulfur),
   - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (polychlorinated biphenyl),
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (benzidine),
   - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (hydroquinone),
   - `c1ccncc1` (pyridine).

2. **1214.08336706**: This value is associated with aliphatic chains, sugars, or polyols, e.g.:
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (cyclic polyol),
   - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (sugar derivative),
   - `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (chlorinated aliphatic),
   - `CCCOC` (simple ether).

3. **458.65371644**: Seen in molecules with alkenes or cyclic structures, e.g., `CC/C=C/C` (butene) and `CC34CCC1C(CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4(O)C#C` (steroid-like with alkyne).

4. **80.93889114**: Appears for simple alkyl-substituted aromatics or phosphates, e.g., `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1` (diethylbenzene) and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (organophosphate).

### Target Molecule: `CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1`
- **Structure**: This is a cyclic sulfone (`S(=O)(=O)`) fused with a lactam (`C(=O)N`) and an aromatic ring (`Nc2ccccc2`). It has a heterocyclic core with aromatic and polar functional groups (sulfone, amide).
- **Pattern Match**: The presence of an aromatic system (benzene ring) and polar heteroatoms (N, O, S) strongly resembles the examples with the property value **-674.49075948**. The sulfone and amide groups do not seem to shift the property outside this recurring cluster.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-674.49075948**  
This aligns with the recurring value for aromatic systems with heteroatoms, despite the additional complexity of the sulfone and cyclic structure.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -119.02778108410503
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will analyze the given molecule and attempt to predict its property value based on structural similarities and recurring patterns in the data.

### Molecule to predict:
```
COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C
```

### Structural analysis:
1. The molecule contains a **nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)** attached to a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`), which is part of a larger fused ring system.
2. It has **ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`)**.
3. The core structure includes a **fused ring system with a nitrogen atom (`NC=`)**, resembling some heterocyclic compounds in the examples.
4. The presence of a **benzene ring with a nitro group** is seen in some examples, such as `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property: -404.69445569) and `CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O` (property: -320.38311075).

### Observations from the examples:
- Molecules with **nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** tend to have negative property values (e.g., -404.69, -320.38).
- **Fused aromatic systems** (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) also have negative values (-674.49).
- **Ester groups (`COC=O`)** appear in molecules with both positive and negative values, but their influence seems secondary to the nitro/aromatic systems.

### Closest matches:
1. `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property: -404.69445569) – nitrobenzene derivative.
2. `CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O` (property: -320.38311075) – fused ring with nitro and sulfonamide.
3. `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (property: -93.39102824) – heterocyclic with nitro-like groups.

The given molecule is more complex than these, with:
- A fused ring system (like the second example).
- Two ester groups (unlike the simpler nitrobenzene).
- A nitrobenzene moiety (like the first example).

### Prediction:
Given the structural complexity and the presence of the nitro group, the property value is likely in the range of **-300 to -400**. A reasonable estimate, considering the closest examples, is:

**Predicted property value: -320.38311075**  
*(This matches the value of the structurally closest example, `CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O`, which also has a fused ring and nitro-like group.)*

1. **-674.49075948**: Often associated with aromatic systems (e.g., benzene rings, polyaromatics, or halogenated aromatics).
2. **1214.08336706**: Typically seen in aliphatic chains (e.g., alkanes, alcohols, or cyclic alkanes without significant functionalization).
3. **-404.69445569**: Found in molecules with a mix of aromatic and simple aliphatic/functional groups (e.g., toluene derivatives or chlorinated benzenes with small substituents).
4. **899.32101264**: Appears in molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., esters, ketones) and moderate aliphatic character.

### Target Molecule: **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**
- **Structure**: This is a bicyclic system with two amide (N-C=O) groups and a cyclopropane (CC1) subunit. It lacks aromaticity but has significant polar character due to the amides.
- **Key Features**:
  - No aromatic rings (rules out -674.49075948).
  - Contains multiple carbonyl groups (amide functionalities) and a strained cyclopropane ring.
  - Similar to other carbonyl-containing aliphatic molecules (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, which has a value of **870.70625314**).

### Closest Analogues:
- The presence of multiple amides and a non-aromatic core suggests a value closer to **899.32101264** (seen in carbonyl-rich aliphatics) or **870.70625314** (complex carbonyl/aliphatic systems). The cyclopropane ring may slightly lower the value due to strain.

Let's analyze the given molecule: **ClCC** (chloroethane). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Simple halogenated alkanes** (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) tend to have the property value **-674.49075948**.
2. **Small alkanes** (e.g., **CCCCC**, **CCC1CCCCC1**) tend to have the property value **1214.08336706**.
3. **Chlorinated small alkanes** (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl**) have values like **584.55865821** or **-674.49075948**, depending on complexity.

**ClCC (chloroethane)** is a very simple chlorinated alkane, structurally similar to **Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene)**, which has **-674.49075948**. Since **ClCC** is even simpler, it likely follows the same trend as other small chlorinated molecules in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-674.49075948** (same as other simple chlorinated compounds in the dataset). 

Thus, the predicted property for **ClCC** is:

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value **1214.08336706** appears frequently for molecules with certain structural features, particularly:

1. **Linear or branched aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1`, `CCCCCCCCl`, `CC(Cl)CCl`, `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl`, `ClCC`, `CCC(C)CCO`, `CCC(CC)CO`).
2. **Presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) or simple functional groups (OH, O)** in aliphatic systems.
3. **No aromatic rings or complex conjugated systems**.

The molecule in question, **`CCCCC(C)O`**, fits this pattern:
- It is a branched aliphatic alcohol (6-carbon chain with an OH group).
- No aromaticity or complex conjugation is present.
- Structurally similar to other molecules with the property value **1214.08336706** (e.g., `CCC(C)CCO`, `CCC(CC)CO`).

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **-404.69445569**, **1214.08336706**, and a few others. These values seem to correlate with specific structural features:

1. **Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl/Br)** often have the value **-674.49075948** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`, `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`, `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1`).
2. **Non-aromatic halogenated compounds** (e.g., `ClCCl`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`) tend to have the value **1214.08336706**.
3. **Sulfur or nitrogen-containing aromatic systems** often have **-404.69445569** (e.g., `c1ccccc1SC`, `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`).

The molecule in question, **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**, is a **dibromobenzene** (aromatic ring with two bromine substituents). Structurally, this is analogous to the examples with **dichlorobenzene** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`), which have the property value **-674.49075948**. 

Since bromine and chlorine are both halogens and the aromatic system is the same, I predict the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** will be the same as the dichlorobenzene examples.

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings, similar to other examples like:  
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = -674.49075948)  
- **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12** (property = -674.49075948)

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -404.6944556859571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples and deduce a plausible property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Large Hydrocarbons (e.g., C9H20, C6H14, C5H12)**: These consistently have a property value of **1214.08336706**, suggesting that large aliphatic chains or rings default to this value unless other functional groups dominate.
2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents (e.g., C6H5-CH3, C6H5-Cl)**: These tend to have negative values, often around **-202.34722784** (for single substitutions) or **-674.49075948** (for multiple halogens or complex substitutions).
3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups (e.g., C=O, OH, OCH3)**: These can lead to values like **584.55865821** (for esters or ethers) or **-202.34722784** (for simple alcohols or aldehydes).
4. **Phosphorus or Sulfur-Containing Groups (e.g., P(=S), S-S)**: These often result in values like **134.8981519** or **584.55865821**.
5. **Complex Polycyclic or Heterocyclic Structures**: These can have highly variable values, but many fall in the range of **-400 to -700** (for heavily substituted aromatics) or **+700 to +1100** (for large polycyclic systems).

### Given Molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

This is a complex aromatic molecule with:
- A central **phosphate group (P=O)** linked to two aromatic rings (one substituted with methyl groups and the other a simple phenyl ring).
- Methyl substituents on the aromatic rings.
- An **O-aryl linkage**, which is common in some of the examples with phosphorus (e.g., P(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)...).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
1. **Phosphate (P=O)** with aryloxy linkages (similar to phosphorus-containing examples like `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` which has a value of **134.8981519**).
2. **Multiple aromatic rings** (which often reduce the value, as seen in many negative examples).
3. **Methyl substituents** (which are neutral or slightly negative contributors).

The molecule is most similar to phosphorus-containing aromatic systems, but with more aromatic bulk. The value is likely **negative** due to the aromatic dominance but not as extreme as heavily halogenated systems (which reach -674). 

A reasonable estimate is **-202.34722784**, matching the trend for moderately substituted aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., `CC(O)c1ccccc1` or `COC(=O)C=C`).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 112.41512657943255
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Positive Values (~1214.08336706)**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains or alcohols (e.g., `CCCC`, `CC(C)CC(C)O`, `CBr`, `CCCCCO`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO`).
   - These molecules lack aromatic rings or complex functional groups.

2. **Negative Values (~-674.49075948)**:
   - Aromatic rings with simple substituents (e.g., `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `NNc1ccccc1`, `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32`).

3. **Intermediate Negative Values (~-404.69445569)**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or multiple halogens (e.g., `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O`, `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`).

4. **Other Notable Values**:
   - `-202.34722784`: Aromatic rings with single substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`, `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).
   - `-464.64918986`: Heterocyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12`).
   - `80.93889114`: Phosphorothioate groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` has:
- A trifluoromethyl (`CF3`) group attached to an aromatic ring.
- A secondary amine (`N2`) linked to a complex aliphatic ring with two chlorine atoms and a carbonyl (`C=O`).
- The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) and a carbonyl group suggests moderate polarity and complexity.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analogs are molecules with aromatic rings and multiple halogens or nitro groups, which tend to have values around `-404.69445569` (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`).
- The trifluoromethyl group and the aliphatic ring with chlorines and a carbonyl are somewhat similar to `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (value `-404.69445569`).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around `-404.69445569`, the predicted property for `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` is:

**-404.69445569**
==================================================
Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -404.6944556859571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group often have negative property values around **-674.49075948**:
     - `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`: -674.49075948
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`: -674.49075948
     - `c1ccccc1O`: -674.49075948 (phenol, but nitro is not present here; this is an outlier)
     - `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2`: -674.49075948 (nitro not present, but aromatic system)
   - However, some nitro-containing molecules deviate (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O` has +1214.08336706, likely due to the aliphatic Cl-rich environment).

2. **Aromatic Systems with Nitro Group**:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene): -674.49075948
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` is similar to nitrobenzene with an added methoxy group (-OCH3).

3. **Methoxy Group (-OCH3)**:
   - Methoxy groups don't seem to drastically alter the property when combined with nitro groups. For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC`: -296.77593417 (not nitro, but ester)
     - `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`: -119.02778108 (complex nitro-aromatic)
   - The methoxy group's effect is likely secondary to the nitro group's dominant influence.

4. **General Trend**:
   - Simple nitro-aromatics (e.g., nitrobenzene-like structures) tend to have the property value **-674.49075948** unless other strong functional groups override this.

### Prediction for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O:
This molecule is **methoxy-nitrobenzene** (a nitro-aromatic with a methoxy substituent). Given the strong trend of nitro-aromatics having the property value **-674.49075948**, and the methoxy group not being disruptive enough to change this significantly in the examples, the predicted property value is:

**-674.49075948**

Iteration: 72
SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 836.3685417509781
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, **-44.96605063**, and **269.79630379**, among others. These values seem to correlate with specific structural or functional group patterns:

1. **-674.49075948**: Frequently appears in molecules with aromatic rings, nitro groups (N(=O)=O), or multiple halogens (Cl, Br) attached to aromatic systems.  
2. **1214.08336706**: Commonly seen in aliphatic chains, ethers (C-O-C), or fully saturated halogenated compounds (e.g., ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl).  
3. **-44.96605063**: Often associated with small branched alkanes or molecules with minimal functionalization (e.g., CC(=C)C(=C)C).  
4. **269.79630379**: Seen in small nitriles (CC#N, ClCC#N) or sulfur-containing groups.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:  
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**  

This is a **highly chlorinated polycyclic alkane** with multiple Cl substituents on a fused ring system. Structurally, it resembles:  
- **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (which has a value of **1214.08336706**).  
- Other fully saturated, highly halogenated aliphatic systems in the examples also consistently yield **1214.08336706**.  

### Key Observations:
- The molecule lacks aromaticity or nitro groups (which would suggest -674.49075948).  
- It is not a small branched alkane (ruling out -44.96605063).  
- It is not a nitrile or sulfur-containing compound (ruling out 269.79630379).  
- It is a **perchlorinated polycyclic alkane**, similar to other aliphatic halogenated compounds in the dataset that map to **1214.08336706**.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarity to other saturated, highly halogenated aliphatic systems in the examples, the predicted property value is:  
**1214.08336706**
==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 741.9398354242546
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, **-202.34722784**, and **269.79630379**, among others. These values seem to correlate with specific structural features or functional groups in the molecules.

For the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's break down its structure:
1. It contains an **ester group (O=C-O)**, which is polar and moderately reactive.
2. The alkyl chain (**CCC**) is nonpolar and relatively inert.
3. No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (like nitro, amino, or halogens) are present.

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has a property value of **-254.80762025**, but it includes an aromatic ring and an amine group, which are absent in CCCOC=O.
- **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has **-230.12037676**, but it is much more complex with multiple rings and heteroatoms.
- Simple aliphatic esters or ethers are not directly represented, but **CC#N** (a simple nitrile) has **269.79630379**, and **CCC#C** (a simple alkyne) has **269.79630379**.

Given the simplicity of **CCCOC=O** and the absence of strongly influencing substituents, the closest analogies suggest a property value in the range of **269.79630379** (similar to small polar molecules like nitriles or alkynes).

### Predicted property value for **CCCOC=O**:  
**269.79630379**
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 1056.7021898466658
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` has a property value of **269.79630379**.
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC` is a long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) with an ester group (`(=O)OCC`). 

2. **Ester Functional Group**:
   - Esters are present in some molecules, but none are as long as `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC`. The closest is `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` with a value of **206.84383291**, but this is more complex.

3. **Simple Hydrocarbons**:
   - `CC` (ethane) has a value of **1214.08336706**.
   - `CCC1CCCCC1` (propylcyclohexane) also has **1214.08336706**.
   - This suggests that simple, saturated hydrocarbons tend to have high values (~1214).

4. **Functional Groups Impact**:
   - Introducing polar or aromatic groups tends to lower the value (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1` has **-404.69445569**).
   - The ester group is polar, so it may reduce the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

5. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer chains seem to reduce the value slightly (e.g., `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` is **269.79630379** vs. `CC` at **1214.08336706**).

### Prediction for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC`:
- This is a long hydrocarbon (10 carbons) with an ester group. 
- The ester group will likely reduce the value compared to a pure hydrocarbon like `CCCCCCCCCC` (which would probably be ~1214).
- The length of the chain may further reduce the value (similar to `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` at **269.79630379**).
- The ester is not as polar as some other groups (e.g., hydroxyl or nitro), so the reduction may not be extreme.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate is close to the value for `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (**269.79630379**) but slightly lower due to the ester. 

### Final Prediction:
**~200.0** (closest to **206.84383291**, which is another ester-containing molecule). 

However, since `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (no ester) is **269.79630379**, and esters reduce the value, I'll predict:

**206.84383291** (same as the other ester example, as this seems to be a recurring value for esters). 

But since `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC` is a simpler ester, perhaps slightly higher. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll round to **250.0**. 

But looking back, the ester examples are **206.84383291** and **978.01160124** (for `CCCCC(CC)C=O`, which is an aldehyde, not an ester). 

Given the lack of a clear trend, the safest prediction is to match the other ester example:

**Predicted property value: 206.84383291**

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

### Observations:
1. **Common property values**:
   - **-674.49075948**: Appears frequently for aromatic systems (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, fused rings) and small polar molecules (e.g., ClC=CCl, C=CC#N).
   - **1214.08336706**: Appears for aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCC, CCCC...CCCC) and some cyclic/aliphatic structures (e.g., CSSC, CCO).
   - Other values seem to depend on functional groups and substitutions.

2. **Key features of the target molecule**:
   - Aromatic rings with substitutions (Cl, OH, NO2, amide).
   - Contains **C(=O)N** (amide) and **N(=O)=O** (nitro group), which are polar and electron-withdrawing.
   - Structurally similar to some examples with **-674.49075948** (e.g., aromatic + polar groups).

3. **Closest analogs**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Property = **-422.68087594** (contains amide + aromatic + Cl).
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = **-674.49075948** (aromatic + Cl + NO2).
   - The target molecule combines both features (amide + NO2 + Cl + OH), suggesting a value between these two.

### Prediction:
The molecule is aromatic with multiple polar substituents (OH, Cl, NO2, amide), likely placing it closer to **-422.68087594** than **-674.49075948**. However, the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing effect may push the property toward the lower end.

Given the complexity, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = -422.68087594** (similar to the amide-containing example).  

However, if the nitro group dominates, it could trend toward **-674.49075948**. Given the examples, I lean toward:  
**Final predicted value: -422.68087594**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural similarity to the provided examples.)

These values seem to correlate with specific structural features:

1. **-674.49075948**: This value appears frequently for aromatic or conjugated systems, especially those with halogens (e.g., chlorinated benzenes, thiophenes, or simple benzene rings).  
2. **1214.08336706**: This value is associated with aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC, CCO, CBr) or non-aromatic, non-polar structures.  
3. **197.15883739**: This appears for structures containing sulfur (e.g., thioether or phosphorothioate groups) or polar functional groups with aliphatic components.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**  

Key features:  
- Contains **phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC))** and **thioether linkages (S)**.  
- Has **aromatic rings** (benzene) but also **aliphatic chains (methoxy groups, OCH3)**.  
- Structurally similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **197.15883739**), which also has a phosphorothioate group and aromatic system.  

### Prediction:
Given the presence of **P(=S)(OC)** and aromatic-thioether linkages, the most plausible property value is:  
**197.15883739**  

This aligns with the observed trend for sulfur/phosphorus-containing polar-aromatic hybrids in the training examples.

Given that our molecule has both aromaticity and a nitro group, and considering that most aromatic compounds with multiple substituents in the examples show -674.49075948, I predict this value for 4-nitrophenol as well.

The predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is: -674.49075948

Iteration: 78
SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain numbers, with many repeating values. The most frequently occurring values are **1214.08336706** (for large aliphatic chains or simple sugars) and **-674.49075948** (for highly halogenated or aromatic systems). 

The molecule in question is a complex sugar (a polysaccharide derivative with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages):

**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**

This structure resembles **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (a simple sugar), which has a property value of **1214.08336706**. Given that the molecule is a larger, more complex sugar with similar functional groups (hydroxyls and ether linkages), it is reasonable to predict that it follows the same trend.

### Predicted Property Value:  
**1214.08336706**  

This aligns with the pattern where large, aliphatic, or carbohydrate-like structures tend to have this specific value.
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 269.7963037906381
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to identify a pattern or trend in the property values based on the molecular structures. Here are some observations:

1. **Hydrocarbons with long aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC...O or CCCC...C=C) tend to have large positive values around 1214.08336706 or 836.36854175.**
   - Examples: 
     - `CCCC(O)CCC` → 1214.08336706
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 1214.08336706
     - `CCCC(=O)C` → 836.36854175
     - `CCCCCCCCC=C` → 836.36854175

2. **Molecules with aromatic rings, halogens (Cl, F, Br, I), nitro groups (NO2), or other polar/heteroatomic groups tend to have negative values, often repeating -674.49075948 or similar.**
   - Examples:
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` → -674.49075948
     - `Fc1cccc(F)c1` → -674.49075948
     - `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` → -674.49075948
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → -674.49075948

3. **Smaller or simpler hydrocarbons (especially those with unsaturation like double or triple bonds) seem to have intermediate values, but this is less consistent.**
   - Example:
     - `Cc1cncc(C)c1` → -134.8981519 (this is an aromatic heterocycle, so it fits the negative trend)
     - `CC#C` (not in the examples, but similar to `CCC#C`).

### Prediction for `CCC#C` (1-butyne):
This is a small aliphatic hydrocarbon with a triple bond. It lacks aromaticity, halogens, or other polar groups. Based on the trend:
- Long aliphatic chains → large positive values.
- Small unsaturated hydrocarbons → likely intermediate or positive values (though no exact match in examples).

The closest analog in the examples is `CCCC(=O)C` (a 4-carbon chain with a ketone) → 836.36854175, and `CCCCCCCCC=C` (a 9-carbon chain with a double bond) → 836.36854175. 

Since `CCC#C` is a 4-carbon chain with a triple bond (similar in size to `CCCC(=O)C` but less polar), I would predict a positive value in the same range as these examples, likely **836.36854175**.

### Final predicted property value for `CCC#C`:
**836.36854175**
==================================================
Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 80.93889113719145
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to follow certain patterns based on molecular features:

1. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`, `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) consistently have a property value of **-674.49075948**.

2. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)(C)CCO`) often have a property value of **1214.08336706**.

3. **Compounds with P(=S) groups** (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tend to have positive values, but not as high as aliphatic hydrocarbons.

The molecule in question is:  
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

### Key features:
1. It contains a **P(=S) group**, similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (which has a value of **197.15883739**).
2. It also has a **chlorinated aromatic ring** (`Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`), which alone would contribute **-674.49075948**.
3. The rest of the molecule (`CCOP(=S)(CC)`) is an aliphatic phosphorothioate fragment.

### Prediction:
Given that the P(=S) group seems to shift the property toward positive values while the chlorinated aromatic ring strongly shifts it negative, I predict the net effect will be a **moderately negative value**, but not as extreme as pure chlorinated aromatics.

Looking at similar cases:
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **197.15883739** (P(=S) + chlorinated aromatic).
- The given molecule has an additional chlorination, which may push the value lower.

Thus, I predict the property value for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** to be:  
**-230.12037676**  
*(This matches the value observed for `c1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C`, which also has a balance of functional groups and chlorinated aromatics.)*  

### Final Answer:
**-230.12037676**
==================================================
Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain key numbers, particularly **-674.49075948**, **1214.08336706**, and a few others. These values seem to correlate with specific structural features:

1. **-674.49075948**: This value appears frequently for aromatic systems (e.g., benzene derivatives, polycyclic aromatics, heteroaromatics like pyridine or thiophene) and some small unsaturated molecules (e.g., C=C). Halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F) on aromatics also often result in this value.

2. **1214.08336706**: This value is associated with aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., branched or linear alkanes like CCCCBr, CC(C)C, ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) and some cyclic alkanes (e.g., CC12CCC(CC1)C(C)(C)O2).

3. Intermediate values (e.g., -438.41899366, -404.69445569) often involve more complex functional groups like esters, amides, or nitro groups, but these are less consistent.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**
- The core structure is a **pyridine ring (c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1)**, which is aromatic.
- It has a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached, which is a functional group with some polarity but not strongly electron-withdrawing or donating enough to deviate from the aromatic trend.
- Most aromatic heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, thiophene, indole) in the examples default to **-674.49075948**, even with moderate substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, CH3).

### Conclusion:
The molecule is primarily aromatic with a modest substituent, so it likely follows the dominant trend for aromatic systems. No examples with similar structures deviate from **-674.49075948**.

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1079.1852151625524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Large positive values (e.g., 1214.08336706)**:
   - Often associated with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**, **BrCBr**, **CCBr**, **OC1C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**).
   - Also seen in cyclic alkanes (e.g., **C/C1CCCCC1\C**, **C/C1CCC(\C)CC1**).
   - Common features: No aromaticity, no electronegative substituents (like NO₂ or Cl), and presence of halogens (Br, I) or hydroxyl groups.

2. **Large negative values (e.g., -674.49075948)**:
   - Often associated with aromatic systems, especially those with electronegative substituents (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1**, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl**, **Oc1ccncc1**).
   - Also seen in conjugated systems or heteroaromatics (e.g., **c1ccoc1**, **C=CC#N**).

3. **Intermediate values (e.g., 584.55865821, 374.7170886)**:
   - Often associated with complex aliphatic structures or mixed aliphatic/aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl**, **CCOC(=O)N**).

4. **Small negative values (e.g., -44.96605063, -202.34722784)**:
   - Often associated with simple aromatic systems or aliphatic chains with minor polar substituents (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, **CCc1ccccc1**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**. Its features include:
- Aliphatic chains (**CCC**, **OCCC**, **CCCCC**).
- A thiophosphate group (**P(=S)**), which is polar but not aromatic.
- An amide group (**C(=O)N**), which is polar but not aromatic.
- No aromatic rings or strongly electronegative substituents (like NO₂ or multiple halogens).

Given the absence of aromaticity and the presence of aliphatic/polar groups, this molecule most closely resembles those with **large positive property values (e.g., 1214.08336706)**. The thiophosphate and amide groups may slightly reduce the value compared to pure alkanes, but the overall structure is still dominated by aliphatic character.

### Predicted Property Value:
The most likely property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is **1214.08336706**, as it fits the pattern of aliphatic-dominated structures with polar but non-aromatic substituents. 

### Final Answer:
**1214.08336706**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around a few distinct numbers, with the most frequent being **1214.08336706**. This value appears consistently for simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols, such as:

- ClCCBr: 1214.08336706  
- CC(Cl)Cl: 1214.08336706  
- OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO: 1214.08336706  
- CCC(O)CC: 1214.08336706  
- C/C1CCCCC1\C: 1214.08336706  
- CCCCCCCO: 1214.08336706  
- CC(C)CO: 1214.08336706  
- C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O: 1214.08336706  
- CC(C)CCO: 1214.08336706  
- CC(C)(C)CO: 1214.08336706  
- CCCCC(C)(C)CO: 1214.08336706  
- CCCCC1CCCC1: 1214.08336706  
- OCC(O)C(O)CO: 1214.08336706  

These molecules share common features:
1. **Aliphatic chains** (saturated hydrocarbons, e.g., CCCCCC, CCCC).
2. **Functional groups like alcohols (OH)** or halogens (Cl, Br), but the property value remains the same even with these substitutions.
3. No aromatic rings or complex conjugated systems (which tend to have negative values like -674.49075948).

The molecule in question, **CCCCCCCC** (octane), is a simple linear aliphatic hydrocarbon, structurally similar to many of the examples above (e.g., CCCCCCCO, CCCCC1CCCC1). Since the property value for such aliphatic chains consistently defaults to **1214.08336706**, even with minor functional group variations, we can confidently predict the same for octane.

### Predicted Property Value for CCCCCCCC:  
**1214.08336706**
==================================================
Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 741.9398354242546
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**: Molecules with steroid-like or polycyclic frameworks (e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**, **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**) tend to have property values in the range of **~500–900**. These structures often include multiple fused rings and functional groups like ketones (=O) or hydroxyls (-OH).

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of **=O (carbonyl)**, **-OH (hydroxyl)**, and **C#C (alkyne)** groups in the target molecule suggests it will have a moderately high property value, similar to other steroid-like molecules in the dataset.

3. **Size and Complexity**: The target molecule is large and complex, with multiple rings and functional groups, which aligns with other high-value examples (e.g., **854.354962**, **915.88745234**).

4. **Specific Examples**:  
   - **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **854.354962**.  
   - **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** has a value of **915.88745234**.  
   The target molecule is structurally similar to these, with additional features like an alkyne (**C#C**) and an extra hydroxyl group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values in the **800–900** range, and accounting for the additional alkyne and hydroxyl group, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C** is:

**~880.0**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 367.4811724044898
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around a few distinct numbers, with the most frequent being **-674.49075948** and **1214.08336706**, among others. The property does not appear to follow a simple trend based on molecular weight, functional groups, or obvious structural features alone. Instead, it may correspond to a specific calculated or measured property (e.g., heat of formation, electronic energy, or a descriptor like logP) with discrete values for certain classes of molecules.

### Observations:
1. **-674.49075948**: This value appears for many aromatic systems, including simple benzenes (e.g., `c1ccccc1`), halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`), and heterocycles (e.g., `c1ccc2ocnc2c1`). Even iodine-substituted benzene (`Ic1ccccc1`) has this value.
2. **1214.08336706**: This appears for aliphatic chains with oxygen or sulfur (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`, `CCSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C`).
3. **-404.69445569**: Seen for aromatic systems with small substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N`, `COc1ccccc1Cl`).
4. Other values (e.g., `269.79630379`, `-438.41899366`) appear for more complex or polar structures.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
This is a **highly oxygenated, polycyclic structure** with multiple ethers, alcohols, and a lactone (COC2=O). It resembles a carbohydrate or glycoside derivative with fused rings and O-heterocycles.

### Prediction:
Given the complexity and oxygen-rich nature of the molecule, it does not fit the simple aromatic or aliphatic categories. The closest matches in the examples are:
- `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (steroid-like, value = **1074.18898731**).
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` (complex phosphate/sulfide, value = **-202.34722784**).

However, the presence of multiple sugar-like rings (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) and a benzodioxole (`OCOc5cc67`) suggests a value distinct from the common clusters. 

Given the lack of exact matches, I predict a value **intermediate between the aliphatic and aromatic extremes**, possibly:
**-202.34722784** (similar to other complex O/S-containing systems).

### Final Answer:
**-202.34722784**
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value often repeats for certain structural motifs. Notably, the value **-674.49075948** appears frequently for aromatic compounds with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, I, F) or nitro groups (NO2), especially when they are monosubstituted or disubstituted on a benzene ring. 

For example:
- **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloro-iodobenzene) → -674.49075948  
- **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) → -674.49075948  
- **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) → -674.49075948  
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) → -674.49075948  

The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (chlorophenol) fits this pattern:
- It is a monosubstituted benzene ring with a halogen (Cl) and a hydroxyl group (OH), similar to other examples where such substitutions yield **-674.49075948**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:  
**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -331.11364556123766
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC, CCC(C)C, CCCO)** tend to have a property value of **1214.08336706**, which seems to be a default or baseline value for small, non-polar molecules.
2. **Aromatic systems (e.g., c1ccccc1, Brc1ccccc1, Sc1ccccc1)** consistently have a property value of **-674.49075948**, suggesting that aromaticity strongly influences the property.
3. **Polar or functionalized aromatics (e.g., COc1ncnc2nccnc12, Cc1ccc(O)cc1)** have values around **-404.69445569**, indicating that substituents on aromatic rings reduce the magnitude of the property.
4. **Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl)** also have the value **-674.49075948**, suggesting that chlorine substitution on aromatics does not significantly alter the property from the base aromatic value.
5. **Molecules with amide or carbonyl groups (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1, O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3)** have negative values but vary widely, likely due to additional structural complexity.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** has the following features:
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (**c1cccc(Cl)c1**), which would typically contribute **-674.49075948** based on the examples.
- An alkyne group (**C#C**), which is not directly represented in the examples but is likely neutral or slightly polar.
- An ester-amide linkage (**OC(=O)N**), which may introduce additional polarity or complexity.
- A terminal chlorine (**ClCC**), which is not strongly represented in the examples but may not dominate the property.

Given that the aromatic part is chlorinated and similar to other chlorinated aromatics in the examples, the property is likely close to the base aromatic value. The additional functional groups may slightly modulate this, but the aromatic component is dominant.

### Predicted Property:
The most consistent value for chlorinated aromatics in the examples is **-674.49075948**. While the other functional groups could introduce minor variations, the lack of clear examples with similar modifiers suggests this is the best estimate.

**Final Prediction: -674.49075948**

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -563.3981637980971
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Recurring Value (-674.49075948):**  
   - This value appears frequently for molecules with:
     - Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine, fused aromatics like naphthalene).
     - Heteroatoms (N, O, S) in aromatic systems.
     - Halogens (Cl, Br) attached to aromatic rings.
     - Examples: `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`, `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br`.

2. **Exceptions (Non -674.49075948 Values):**  
   - Molecules with aliphatic chains, non-aromatic carbonyls, or phosphorus/sulfur groups tend to deviate (e.g., `CCCBr`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CC(C)C(C)C` all have **1214.08336706**).
   - Conjugated systems or steric complexity may also shift values (e.g., `CC12CCC(O)CC1CCC3C2CCC4(C)C3CCC4=O` has **1114.68472882**).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- **Structure:**  
  The molecule has:
  - Two aromatic rings (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `c3ccccc3Cl`) with chlorine substituents.
  - A pyrimidine-like heterocycle (`c2cncnc2`).
  - An oxygen linker (`OC`).
- **Similarity to Examples:**  
  This closely resembles molecules like `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` or `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, which have the **-674.49075948** value. The presence of aromatic systems with halogens and heteroatoms strongly aligns with the recurring value.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-674.49075948**  
*(This matches the dominant pattern observed for aromatic, halogenated, and heterocyclic systems in the examples.)*

Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCCBr`, `CCS`, `CCI`, `C1CCCCCCC1`) tend to have a property value of **1214.08336706**.
2. **Carbonyl-containing aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCC(=O)OCC`, `CCCCCC=O`) have a property value of **899.32101264**.
3. **Aromatic systems with nitro or other polar groups** tend to have negative or lower values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -438.41899366).
4. **Small halogenated molecules** (e.g., `ClC=C(Cl)Cl`, `BrC(Br)Br`) tend to have values like **-674.49075948** or **1214.08336706**, depending on the structure.

The molecule in question is `CCCCOC=O` (butyl formate). This is an aliphatic ester with a carbonyl group (`C=O`) and an ether linkage (`O`). 

Comparing to similar structures:
- `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) has a value of **899.32101264**.
- `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal) also has a value of **899.32101264**.

Both are aliphatic carbonyl compounds with similar chain lengths. The presence of the ether oxygen (`O`) in `CCCCOC=O` does not seem to drastically alter the property compared to the ester or aldehyde examples. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCOC=O` is:

**899.32101264**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice a pattern where simple halogenated alkanes (especially those with chlorine or bromine) and simple alkanes often have the property value of **1214.08336706**. For instance:

- ClCCCl: 1214.08336706  
- CCBr: 1214.08336706  
- CCCC: 1214.08336706  
- CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO: 1214.08336706  
- CNN: 1214.08336706  

These molecules share the characteristic of being small, saturated, and often halogenated or purely hydrocarbon-based without complex functional groups. 

The molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) fits this pattern: it is a simple halogenated alkane with no additional functional groups or complexity. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:

**1214.08336706**

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -202.34722784297855
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that certain structural features correlate with specific property values. Here are some key observations:

1. **Aromatic rings with hydroxyl (-OH) groups** often have the property value **-674.49075948** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1`, `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`, `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2`).

2. **Aliphatic chains or simple cyclic/aliphatic structures** often have the property value **1214.08336706** (e.g., `CC1CCCO1`, `CCOC(C)OCC`, `CCCCCCCCBr`, `CC(C)C(C)O`).

3. **Molecules with mixed aromatic and aliphatic features** sometimes have intermediate values (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` has **80.93889114**).

The molecule in question is **`Cc1cccc(C)c1O`**, which is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (toluene derivative with a hydroxyl group). Structurally, it is very similar to aromatic molecules with -OH groups, which consistently have the property value **-674.49075948**. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice a pattern where certain structural features correlate with specific property values. Here are the key observations:

1. The value -674.49075948 appears frequently for molecules with:
   - Multiple aromatic rings (especially polycyclic aromatics)
   - Multiple halogen (Cl, Br) substitutions on aromatic rings
   - Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) attached to aromatic rings
   - Certain heterocyclic structures

2. The molecule in question: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has:
   - Two benzene rings connected directly
   - Five chlorine substituents (heavy halogenation)
   - A biphenyl-like structure similar to several examples that had -674.49075948

3. This matches closely with:
   - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (-674.49075948)
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-674.49075948)
   - Other polychlorinated biphenyl-type structures in the examples

Given this consistent pattern for polychlorinated aromatic systems, the predicted property value is:

-674.49075948
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 458.6537164440847
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular size, branching, and functional groups. The property tends to increase with larger, more branched aliphatic chains and decreases with aromaticity or polar functional groups.

For the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutene or 2-methylpropene):
- It is a small, branched alkene with 4 carbon atoms.
- Comparing it to similar molecules:
  - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (complex, aromatic, polar) has a low value (-230.12).
  - **CCC1(C(=O)NCNC1=O)c2ccccc2** (aromatic + polar) has -44.97.
  - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane, 8 carbons) has a high value (1214.08).
  - **CCCCCCCC** (linear alkane, 8 carbons) also has 1214.08.
  - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (steroid-like, large) has 854.35.
  - **CCCOC(=O)CCC** (ester, 7 carbons) has 944.29.
  - **CC=C(C)C** is smaller and less branched than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** but has a double bond, which may slightly reduce the property compared to a saturated analog.

Given that **CCCCCCCC** (octane) is 1214.08 and **CC=C(C)C** is much smaller (4 carbons) with one double bond, I estimate its property value to be **significantly lower** but still positive due to its aliphatic nature. 

A reasonable prediction, based on interpolation, is:  
**~500 to 600**.  

Looking for closer analogs:  
- **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (7 carbons + aldehyde) is 978.01.  
- **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (complex ketone) is 803.52.  

Since **CC=C(C)C** is simpler and smaller, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 550.0** (approximate, likely between 500–600).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of larger/aliphatic = higher value, aromatic/polar = lower value.)  

---  
**Final answer: 550.0** (estimated).  

(If you can clarify the property being predicted, I could refine this further!)

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that certain structural patterns correlate with specific property values. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple alkanes and alcohols** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO`, `CC(C)C(C)O`) consistently have the property value **1214.08336706**.

2. **Aromatic compounds with hydroxyl (-OH) and/or chlorine (-Cl) substituents** (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) consistently have the property value **-674.49075948**.

3. **Small halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`) also have the property value **-674.49075948**, suggesting that highly chlorinated small molecules default to this value.

4. **Molecules with double bonds or sulfur** (e.g., `C=CCCC=C`, `C=CCS(=O)SCC=C`) have the property value **-44.96605063**.

### Prediction for `ClCCl`:
- This is a small, chlorinated molecule (dichloromethane analog). 
- Based on the pattern, small chlorinated molecules like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (carbon tetrachloride analog) have the property value **-674.49075948**.
- There are no examples of simpler chlorinated alkanes deviating from this trend.

Thus, the predicted property value for `ClCCl` is:
**-674.49075948**
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values associated with certain structural features. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to the examples to predict its property value.

### Molecule to Predict:
**Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**  
This is a chlorinated phenol derivative with three chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring. Structurally, it resembles the following example from the list:

**Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property value: **-674.49075948**)

The only difference between the molecule to predict and the example is the position of the chlorine atoms (the example has two chlorines adjacent and one meta, while the molecule to predict likely has a similar substitution pattern with minor positional differences). Given that the structural features (chlorinated phenol) are nearly identical, the property value is expected to be very similar.

### Observed Patterns:
1. Chlorinated aromatic rings (especially with multiple chlorines) tend to have property values around **-674.49075948**, as seen in:
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1**: -674.49075948
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**: -674.49075948
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**: -674.49075948
   - **c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2**: -674.49075948
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**: -674.49075948

2. The presence of multiple halogens (Cl, Br) or fused aromatic rings often leads to this recurring value.

### Prediction:
Since **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is structurally very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, the property value is likely the same.

### Final Answer:
**-674.49075948**

Iteration: 96
SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 367.4811724044898
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, **-44.96605063**, **342.4337702**, and others. These likely correspond to specific structural or functional group patterns in the molecules.

### Observations:
1. **Large positive values (~1214.08336706)** appear for:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CCCCl`, `CC1CCCC1`).
   - Small alcohols or halogenated alkanes (e.g., `OCC(O)CO`, `CC(C)CBr`).
   - Molecules with no strong electron-withdrawing groups or complex conjugation.

2. **Large negative values (~-674.49075948)** appear for:
   - Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`, `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`).
   - Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), heavy halogens, or conjugated systems (e.g., `C#C`, `Sc1ccccc1`).

3. **Intermediate values** (e.g., **342.4337702**, **854.354962**) appear for:
   - More complex structures with mixed functional groups (e.g., steroids, sugars, or heterocycles with both donating and withdrawing groups).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Breaking it down:
- It contains **multiple methoxy groups (`OCH3`)** and **hydroxy groups (`OH`)**.
- It has a **fused polycyclic structure** with **ether linkages (`OCO`) and a lactone (`COC2=O`)**.
- The presence of **sugar-like moieties (e.g., `OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`)** suggests a carbohydrate-like component.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or cyano) are present.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to **OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O** (property = **1214.08336706**), which is a sugar derivative with multiple hydroxyl groups.
- It also resembles **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO** (property = **854.354962**), which is a steroid-like structure with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given the **absence of strong electron-withdrawing groups** and the **presence of multiple hydroxyl/methoxy groups and a sugar-like framework**, the property value is likely to be in the **higher range**, similar to other polyol or carbohydrate-like structures. 

The closest match is **1214.08336706**, which appears for many hydroxyl-rich aliphatic systems. However, the additional complexity (fused rings, lactone) might slightly reduce this value. 

Given the examples, the most plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 854.354962**  
*(This aligns with the steroid/sugar-like examples of intermediate complexity.)*

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 505.86806960744633
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly -674.49075948, 1214.08336706, and other distinct values. The property appears to be sensitive to specific functional groups and structural features rather than simple molecular weight or elemental composition.

Key observations:
1. Aromatic systems with halogens (especially Cl) often have the value -674.49075948
2. Simple aliphatic chains/rings with oxygen or halogens often have 1214.08336706
3. Complex heterocycles with multiple nitrogen atoms tend to have positive values in the range of 500-800
4. Thioamides and sulfur-containing compounds often have values around -44.96605063 to 197.15883739

The target molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has:
- A thiol group (CS-)
- A complex heterocycle with multiple nitrogens (triazole-like)
- A tertiary butyl group
- Amide-like functionality (=O adjacent to N)

Comparing with similar structures in the examples:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (647.5111291) has a somewhat similar structure with multiple nitrogens and a C(C)(C)C group
- The presence of sulfur might moderate this value somewhat lower

Given these considerations, the most reasonable prediction for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be:

**584.55865821**

This is close to the similar structure mentioned above but slightly lower due to the thiol group's influence.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -254.80762024671378
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values associated with similar structures.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene derivatives)**:
   - Most simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1`, `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`) have a property value of **-674.49075948**.
   - Substitutions like nitro (`N(=O)=O`) or alkyl groups (`C(C)c1ccccc1`) slightly modify the value (e.g., `-404.69445569` or `-44.96605063`).

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - `CCCC(=O)OC` has a value of **944.28706327**.
   - `CCCCC(=O)OCC` also has a value of **944.28706327**.
   - This suggests that esters with aliphatic chains tend to have values around **944.28706327**.

3. **Aromatic Esters**:
   - The molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is an aromatic ester (ethyl benzoate), where a benzene ring is directly attached to the carbonyl of the ester.
   - From the examples, aromatic systems with esters are not explicitly listed, but we can infer:
     - Aromatic rings alone give **-674.49075948**.
     - Aliphatic esters give **944.28706327**.
     - The combination might average or interpolate between these values.

4. **Other Clues**:
   - The molecule `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (a cyclic imide with aliphatic chains) has a value of **584.55865821**, suggesting that carbonyls in non-aromatic systems can reduce the magnitude compared to pure aliphatic esters.
   - The molecule `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a benzofuranone) has a value of **-502.80220252**, which is less negative than pure aromatic systems, indicating that carbonyls in aromatic systems may partially offset the aromatic effect.

### Prediction for `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`:
- The molecule is an aromatic ester, combining:
  - An aromatic ring (contributing **-674.49075948**).
  - An aliphatic ester group (contributing **+944.28706327**).
- The net effect might be roughly the average or sum of these contributions, but likely closer to the ester value because the ester group is the dominant functional group.
- Given that `CCCC(=O)OC` and `CCCCC(=O)OCC` are **944.28706327**, and the aromatic ring might slightly reduce this, a reasonable estimate is slightly less than **944.28706327**.

However, looking at the molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2`, which has a value of **-296.77593417**, we see that complex aromatic esters with additional electronegative groups can have negative values. But for the simpler `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`, the ester likely dominates.

Given the lack of an exact match, the closest estimate is **944.28706327** (same as aliphatic esters), but this might be too high. Alternatively, if the aromatic ring pulls the value down, it could be closer to **500-600**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible value based on the examples is:  
**944.28706327** (same as aliphatic esters, assuming the aromatic ring does not significantly alter the property).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **944.28706327**.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some patterns:

1. **Simple alkanes with terminal halogens (Br, Cl, I)** tend to have the value **1214.08336706** (e.g., `CI`, `CSSC`, `OCC(O)C(O)CO`, `CCN(=O)=O`, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`).
2. **Aromatic systems with halogens or nitro groups** tend to have the value **-674.49075948** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, `NC(=O)c1ccccc1`, `Nc1ccccc1O`).
3. **Ketones or aldehydes in aliphatic chains** tend to have values like **944.28706327** (e.g., `CCCC(=O)CCC`) or **1004.24179744** (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)CCCC`).
4. **Brominated aromatic systems** also follow the **-674.49075948** trend (e.g., `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1`).

The molecule in question, `CCCCCCCBr`, is a simple linear alkane with a terminal bromine. Based on the examples:
- `CI` (iodomethane) has **1214.08336706**.
- `CSSC` (a disulfide) has **1214.08336706**.
- Other simple halogen-terminated aliphatics (like `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`) also have **1214.08336706**.

Thus, the predicted property for `CCCCCCCBr` is:

**1214.08336706**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain recurring numbers, such as **1214.08336706**, **-674.49075948**, **674.49075948**, and others. These values appear to correlate with specific structural features or functional groups in the molecules.

For the molecule **CO (formaldehyde)**:
1. It is a small, simple molecule with a carbonyl group (C=O).
2. Looking at similar small molecules in the examples:
   - **CCC (propane)** has a value of **1214.08336706**.
   - **CC#C (propyne)** has a value of **-44.96605063**.
   - **CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O** (a complex nitroaromatic) has **-438.41899366**.
   - **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C** has **-119.02778108**.

Given that **CO** is even simpler than **CCC** and lacks the complexity or functional groups that lead to negative values in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value aligns with the trend for small, unfunctionalized molecules. The most common value for such cases in the dataset is **1214.08336706**.

### Predicted property value for **CO**: **1214.08336706**
