SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 433.91592155474723
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some observations:

1. **Long hydrocarbon chains** (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O`) tend to have moderately negative or small positive property values (e.g., -729.39, 45.38, 95.75).
2. **Esters** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC`, `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) have property values in the range of ~500-600 (e.g., 531.80 for `CCOC(=O)CC`).
3. **Longer esters** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) would likely have a slightly higher value than shorter esters due to increased chain length.

From the examples:
- `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl butanoate) has a property value of **531.7966918**.
- `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl octanoate) is not explicitly listed, but longer esters like `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate) would be expected to have a slightly higher value.

Given this trend, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate) would likely be **~440-550**. 

Looking at the closest example:
- `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl dodecanoate, similar structure) has a value of **440.46128271**.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is approximately **440.46**. 

### Final Answer:
**440.46128271** (estimated based on similar ester examples).

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 376.59285250445475
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** by identifying patterns or trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**: The molecule is a chlorinated heterocyclic compound with a fused ring system containing oxygen and nitrogen (likely a benzofuran or similar structure with a lactam or amide group). It has:
   - A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.
   - A fused ring with a carbonyl (C=O) and an NH group (likely a lactam or amide).
   - An oxygen in the ring (heterocyclic).

2. **Observed Trends**:
   - Chlorine substituents tend to lower the property value (e.g., ClC=C has a very negative value, ClCC is highly negative).
   - Heterocyclic systems with nitrogen and oxygen (e.g., c1cncnc1, C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)) have a mix of positive and negative values, but the presence of carbonyls (C=O) and NH groups often leads to moderately positive values (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O) has 120.72).
   - Fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms can have significant positive or negative values depending on substituents (e.g., Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 is -224.21, while Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12 is 419.23).

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest examples are likely C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) (-321.45) and c1cncnc1 (526.87), but our molecule has both chlorine and a fused ring system.
   - The chlorine substituent will likely reduce the property value compared to purely heterocyclic systems without halogens.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the presence of the lactam/amide (C=O and NH) and the fused ring, I'd expect a moderately positive value, but the chlorine will pull it down somewhat.
   - A reasonable guess would be between 200 and 500 based on similar structures.

Given these considerations, I predict the property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** to be approximately **285.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For a precise prediction, computational methods or a larger training set would be needed.)

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1016.4964122398745
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CC(C)N(=O)=O` (which is isopropyl nitrite or a similar nitro compound) by identifying patterns in the data. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Haloalkanes**: 
   - `CCCOCC` (ether) has a value of `-729.39117821`.
   - `CCCCCl` has a value of `-1011.62929919`.
   - `CCC(C)CC` (branched alkane) has a value of `59.62313807`.
   - `CCI` and `ClCC` (very small haloalkanes) have a value of `-2071.55558583`.

2. **Nitro/Nitrate-Containing Compounds**:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (nitro group on a heterocycle) has a value of `589.33135437`.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (nitroso/nitro-like) has a value of `-1356.40294671`.

3. **General Trends**:
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) seem to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons or halocarbons (e.g., `589.33135437` for the nitro heterocycle).
   - Small molecules with polar groups (like `CC(C)N(=O)=O`) tend to have moderate positive values unless heavily substituted with halogens or other electronegative atoms.

### Prediction for `CC(C)N(=O)=O`:
This is a small nitroalkane (isopropyl nitrite or similar). Given that:
- The nitro heterocycle (`Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO`) has a value of `589.33135437`.
- Simple branched alkanes like `CCC(C)CC` have a value of `59.62313807`.
- The nitro group likely adds a significant positive contribution.

Thus, for `CC(C)N(=O)=O`, I predict a value in the range of **500 to 700**, similar to the nitro heterocycle but slightly lower due to the lack of aromaticity or additional heteroatoms. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: ~550.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property and its dependence on molecular features.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -1943.9763482616193
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, branching, and electronegative atoms (e.g., halogens, oxygen, nitrogen). The property values range widely, from highly negative to highly positive, likely representing a calculated or experimental molecular property such as dipole moment, polarizability, or a quantum-chemical descriptor (e.g., HOMO-LUMO gap, heat of formation).

For the molecule:  
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Complexity**: The molecule is highly complex, with multiple fused rings (steroid-like structure), including a cyclohexane and cyclopentane fusion, and additional substituents.
2. **Functional Groups**:  
   - Two carbonyl groups (C=O): one in a ketone (=O) and one in an aldehyde (C(=O)CO).  
   - A hydroxyl group (OH).  
   - Saturated hydrocarbon regions (CC, CCC).  
3. **Electronegative Atoms**: Oxygen atoms in OH and C=O groups contribute to polarity.  
4. **Similarity to Examples**:  
   - The closest example is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **-2001.96643407**), which shares a similar steroid-like backbone with carbonyl groups.  
   - The additional **C(=O)CO** and **OH** groups in the query molecule may increase the polarity or alter the property slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example with a value of **-2001.96643407**, but with slightly more polar groups (OH and aldehyde), the property is likely in the same range but less negative due to the added polarity.  

**Predicted Property Value: -1800.0** (approximate, considering structural adjustments).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being calculated, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the examples.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -1268.1601159635427
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, it appears that the property in question is likely related to molecular dipole moments, polarizability, or some other electronic property influenced by functional groups and molecular structure. 

Let's analyze the given molecule: 

**Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**

This molecule consists of:
1. A difluorobenzene ring (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`), which is electron-withdrawing and contributes to polarity.
2. A urea-like linker (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`), which is polar due to the carbonyl groups and hydrogen-bonding capability.
3. A chlorophenyl ring (`Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`), which adds further polarity due to the electronegative chlorine substituent.

### Observations from the training data:
- Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher absolute property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 588.56, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = 1177.24).
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., `CN(C)c1ccccc1` = 238.39, `Oc1ccccn1` = 567.67) also show significant values.
- The urea-like fragment (`NC(=O)NC(=O)`) is not explicitly in the training data, but similar polar groups (e.g., `C(=O)NN`) contribute to intermediate values (~246.75).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- Two fluorine atoms (electron-withdrawing).
- A chlorine atom (electron-withdrawing).
- Two carbonyl groups (highly polar).
- A conjugated aromatic system (delocalized electrons).

Given the combined effects, this molecule is highly polar, and its property value should be on the higher end of the scale. Comparing to similar structures in the training data (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = 1177.24, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 588.56), but with additional polar groups, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` due to the urea linker.

### Predicted property value:
**1250.0** (approximate, based on the trends in the training data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of 1000â€“1500 given the substituents and polarity.)

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -84.70018262600972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **531.7966918**.
   - **OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O** (a complex sugar-like ether) has a very negative value (**-2029.84347053**), but this is likely due to the large size and multiple polar groups.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** is a simpler ether, so its value should be closer to small ethers/alcohols.

2. **Alcohol Functional Group (-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCC(O)CC** (heptan-2-ol) has a value of **292.35485672**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol) has a very high value (**2399.48870132**) due to multiple -OH groups.
   - Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so their values are typically lower than analogous alcohols.

3. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (a branched hydrocarbon) has a value of **1060.45216641**.
   - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexylpentane) has a negative value (**-1542.79245395**), but this is likely due to ring strain or size effects.
   - Simple hydrocarbons tend to have positive values, while ethers are slightly less positive due to the oxygen's electronegativity.

4. **Size and Branching**:
   - **CCCOC(C)C** has 6 carbons and is branched (isopropyl group). Smaller branched molecules like **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol) have high values (**1266.14564043**), but ethers are less extreme.

### Prediction for CCCOC(C)C:
- It is a small, branched ether with no additional functional groups.
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)CC** (531.7966918), **CCCOC(C)C** lacks the carbonyl group, which likely reduces the value.
- Compared to **CCCCCC(O)CC** (292.35485672), the ether oxygen is less polar than an alcohol -OH, so the value should be lower.
- The branching (isopropyl group) may slightly increase the value compared to linear ethers.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOC(C)C** is around **200 to 300**. Since the closest analog is **CCCCCC(O)CC** (292.35485672), and ethers are less polar, I predict a slightly lower value.

### Final Prediction:
**250.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., heat of formation, dipole moment, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1532.5591026734257
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, it's challenging to identify a clear pattern or a single property (such as molecular weight, dipole moment, or logP) that consistently explains the given values. However, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule based on structural similarities and trends observed in the provided examples.

### Analysis of the New Molecule:
**Molecule:**  
`CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O`  
This is a brominated uracil derivative with an ethyl and isopropyl substitution. Key features:
- Bromine substituent (`Br`).
- Two carbonyl groups (`C=O`).
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycle (uracil-like).
- Alkyl groups (`CCC(C)`).

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Bromine-containing molecules**:  
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`: Property = 25.6237901  
   - `CCCCCCCBr`: Property = -366.39592192  
   Bromine seems to contribute to a wide range of values, but the context (aromatic vs. aliphatic) matters.

2. **Carbonyl-containing molecules**:  
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`: Property = 540.87013391  
   - `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`: Property = -1903.35556695  
   Carbonyls appear in both high and low values, suggesting other factors dominate.

3. **Nitrogen-containing heterocycles**:  
   - `Nc1nccs1`: Property = 621.2448863  
   - `COc2cnc1cncnc1n2`: Property = -92.80009163  
   Nitrogen heterocycles also span a wide range.

4. **Alkyl groups**:  
   - `CCC(C)CC`: Property = 59.62313807  
   - `CC(C)CCO`: Property = -181.72332305  
   Alkyl groups alone don't strongly correlate with high or low values.

### Closest Analogues:
The new molecule is most similar to:  
- `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (Property = -471.17651855): Aromatic, nitrogen-containing, but no bromine.  
- `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (Property = 25.6237901): Bromine on an aromatic ring.  
- `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` (Property = -2263.5541202): Complex nitrogen heterocycle.  

### Prediction:
Given the presence of bromine and the uracil-like structure (which is polar and may have significant dipole interactions), I would expect the property value to be in the mid-range, possibly negative due to the polar nature. A reasonable guess would be between -500 and 0.

**Predicted Property Value:**  
`-320.0`  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data.)

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -504.9862565463299
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, conjugation, and substitution patterns. 

The molecule in question is **biphenyl** (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`), which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. This structure is highly conjugated and aromatic, similar to some of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the examples (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` with a value of `-1158.65493278`). However, biphenyl is simpler than large PAHs but more complex than single-ring systems.

Comparing to similar molecules in the examples:
- `Cc1cc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a naphthalene derivative) has a value of `-336.32870049`.
- `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a phenanthrene derivative) has a value of `-733.13498547`.

Biphenyl is less complex than phenanthrene but more conjugated than a simple naphthalene derivative. Interpolating between these, the property value for biphenyl is likely in the range of `-400` to `-600`.

**Predicted property value for biphenyl (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`): `-512.34567890`**

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -1011.6292991896547
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse range of property values for the provided molecules, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact value for **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan) without a clear trend or mathematical model. However, I can make an educated guess based on the following observations:

1. **Small aliphatic molecules** (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` = 206.12, `CC(C)I` = -758.48, `CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O)` = 1716.33) show a wide range of values, but sulfur-containing compounds may have distinct contributions.
2. **Sulfur-containing molecules** in the dataset (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` = 2635.46, `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` = 1506.98) tend to have higher-magnitude values, possibly due to polarizability or electronic effects.
3. **Simple aliphatic thiols** like **CCCCS** lack direct analogs in the dataset, but its structure is simpler than most sulfur-containing examples, suggesting a moderate value.

### Predicted Property for **CCCCS**:  
**Approximately 500 Â± 200**  
*(Plausible range: 300â€“700, based on interpolation of similar-sized molecules and sulfur effects)*  

*Note: Without a clear pattern or model, this is a rough estimate. For precise predictions, computational methods (e.g., QSPR, DFT) or more training data would be needed.*
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1236.6021185316952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as size, branching, functional groups, and halogens. The molecule in question is **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, which is a branched alcohol with a butyl chain and a tertiary carbon center.

Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CCCC(C)(O)CC** has a property value of **1236.60211853**. This is a hexanol with a similar branched structure but a secondary alcohol.
- **CC(C)CC(C)O** has a property value of **437.95844643**, which is a smaller branched alcohol.
- **CCC(C)(C)C** (a branched hydrocarbon) has a value of **847.14078162**.

Since **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a larger branched alcohol than **CC(C)CC(C)O** but less polar than **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (due to the primary vs. secondary alcohol), I estimate its property value to be between these two, closer to the higher end due to the longer carbon chain.

### Predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:  
**Approximately 900â€“1100** (likely around **1050** as a reasonable interpolation).  

However, looking more carefully, **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (1236.6) is very similar but with a slightly more exposed -OH, while **CCCC(C)(C)CO** has a primary -OH at the end of a less branched chain. This might reduce the value slightly compared to **CCCC(C)(O)CC**.  

### Final prediction:  
**~1000â€“1100** (e.g., **1050.0** as a midpoint estimate).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)*

**Answer:** **1050.0** (estimated based on structural similarity to provided data).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 201.6453059317369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (two methyl groups on a benzene ring): **997.96074504**
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (two methyl groups on a benzene ring): **853.20088219**
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** (one methyl group on a benzene ring): **588.56456125**
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene with no substituents): **526.87257404**

   The presence of methyl groups tends to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted benzene, with more methyl groups leading to higher values.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): **425.12442398**
   - **c1ccc2ccccc12** (unsubstituted naphthalene): Not explicitly given, but we can infer from the methyl-substituted naphthalene that the unsubstituted form would likely be lower than **425.12442398**.

3. **Target Molecule: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
   - This is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (methyl group on one of the rings). 
   - Comparing to **Cc1ccc2ccccc12** (property: **425.12442398**), the only difference is the position of the methyl group. The given example has the methyl group on the same ring as the fusion point, while the target molecule has it on the other ring. This positional difference may slightly affect the property, but the magnitude should be similar.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Cc1ccc2ccccc12 (425.12442398)**, the property for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** should be in a comparable range. Since the methyl group is on the opposite ring, the value might be slightly higher or lower, but not drastically different. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**~400 to 450**

Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**425.12442398** (same as the provided methyl-naphthalene example, as the structural difference is minor). 

However, if we consider that the methyl group is on the less congested ring in the target molecule, the value might be slightly higher. Adjusting slightly:  
**430.0**

### Final Answer:
**430.0** (estimated based on similar structures). 

(Note: Without a clear quantitative trend or more examples of positional isomers, this is an approximate prediction. The actual value could be closer to **425.12442398** or slightly higher.)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 742.8981790685775
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and conjugation. 

The molecule in question is:  
**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Cyclic imide core**: The structure has a 5-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogen atoms (similar to a hydantoin or succinimide derivative). This is seen in some of the examples (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` with a property value of **431.03241148**).
2. **Substituents**: The ring is substituted with a branched alkyl chain (`C(C)CCC`) and an alkenyl group (`CC=C`). These substituents add complexity compared to the simpler example above.
3. **Polarity and conjugation**: The carbonyl and imide groups are polar, and the alkene adds some conjugation.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The simpler imide (`O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C`) has a value of **431.03241148**.
- Adding a branched alkyl chain (`C(C)CCC`) and extending the alkene (`CC=C`) would likely increase the property value due to increased molecular weight and hydrophobicity, but the exact effect depends on the dataset's trends.

### Prediction:
Given the additional substituents, the property value should be higher than **431.03241148** but not drastically so (since no highly polar or halogenated groups are added). A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **500â€“700**.

However, looking closely at the examples, molecules with similar imide structures and moderate substituents (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)OC1=CC(=O)CC(C)(C)C1` with a value of **-32.18556036**) show variability. The presence of the alkene might slightly increase the value.

Given the closest analog (`O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` at **431.03241148**), and accounting for the additional `C(C)CCC` group (which is somewhat similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` at **1266.14564043**, though that has an OH group), I predict a value slightly higher than 431 but not as high as 1266.

### Final predicted property value:  
**600.69205947**  
*(This matches the value for `CCCCOc1ccc(C(=O)OCC)c(c1)N(CC)CC` in the examples, which is coincidental but reasonable given the structural complexity.)*  

However, a more precise estimate based on the imide core and substituent effects would be closer to:  
**550.0** (interpolated between the simpler imide and more complex examples).  

But since the exact relationship isn't linear, I'll stick with the closest analog's value:  
**Predicted property value: 600.69205947**

True Property: 462.32691228082354
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as functional groups, aromaticity, halogens, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`  
This is **benzotrifluoride**, where a benzene ring is substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (â€“CFâ‚ƒ). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` and `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have property values ranging from positive (e.g., 588.56) to negative (e.g., -11.92 or -189.38), depending on the number and type of halogens.
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (iodochlorobenzene): **588.56456125**
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl-like): **-189.37688705**

2. **Fluorinated compounds** are not explicitly in the examples, but fluorine is highly electronegative and may influence the property similarly to other halogens but with stronger effects due to its electronegativity.

3. The **trifluoromethyl group (â€“CFâ‚ƒ)** is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which could lead to a more negative or less positive value compared to simple halogenated aromatics.

4. **Benzene derivatives** with simple substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1CC` or `COc1ccccc1O`) have positive values (e.g., 458.44 or 539.27), but electron-withdrawing groups like â€“CFâ‚ƒ may reduce this.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The presence of fluorine (especially three fluorines in â€“CFâ‚ƒ) is likely to reduce the property value compared to non-fluorinated analogs.
- The aromatic ring contributes some positive value, but the â€“CFâ‚ƒ group counteracts this.

A reasonable estimate is **between 200 and 400**, leaning toward the lower end due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of â€“CFâ‚ƒ. 

Looking at similar-sized halogenated aromatics:
- `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (iodochlorobenzene): **588.56**
- `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (more chlorines): **-189.38**

For `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`, the â€“CFâ‚ƒ group is less bulky than multiple halogens but strongly electron-withdrawing. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 320.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity, given the variability in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., dipole moment, solubility parameter, etc.â€”this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -168.04858985732682
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). 

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = **2399.48870132**) have very high property values, likely due to their high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity. 

The given molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar but slightly less linear (cyclic with 5 hydroxyl groups) compared to the linear hexitol (6 hydroxyl groups) in the example. Thus, its property value should be slightly lower but still very high.

### Predicted Property Value:
**~2200.0** (approximate, likely in the range of **2100-2300** based on the trend of polyols in the dataset).

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measuredâ€”e.g., energy, solubility, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with hydroxyl group count.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -2012.7001596837677
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, carbonyl groups, halogens, and conjugated systems. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule has three carbonyl groups (two ketones and one ester), which are polar and can influence the property value.
2. **Steroid-like polycyclic structure**: The molecule contains a complex fused ring system (steroid-like backbone), which is highly rigid and contributes significantly to the property value.
3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: There are two hydroxyl groups, which add polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability.
4. **Conjugated double bond (C=CC)**: The presence of a conjugated double bond in one of the rings may slightly affect the property.

### Comparison with similar molecules from the examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property: **-2151.65559527**): This is a very similar steroid-like molecule with two carbonyl groups and no hydroxyl groups. The property is highly negative.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **-1950.27021466**): This is another steroid-like molecule with one carbonyl and one hydroxyl group. The property is also highly negative but less so than the previous example.

### Prediction:
The molecule in question has **more polar groups (three C=O and two OH)** than the two examples above, which would likely make the property value **less negative** (higher) due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. However, the conjugated double bond might slightly offset this. 

Given the trends:
- The first example (two C=O, no OH) has a property of **-2151.65559527**.
- The second example (one C=O, one OH) has a property of **-1950.27021466**.
- The current molecule (three C=O, two OH, one C=C) should logically have a **less negative** value than both.

A reasonable estimate would be between **-1800 and -1500**. Splitting the difference and considering the additional C=O and OH, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -1685.46290544**  

This is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing polarity reducing the magnitude of the negative property value.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -2063.816687584175
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse range of property values for the provided molecules, it is clear that the property in question is highly sensitive to molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall complexity. The molecule to predict is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an oxygenated functional group, and significant rigidity:

**Molecule:**  
`CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`

### Observations:
1. **Structural Features**:  
   - The molecule is a polycyclic steroid derivative with a ketone (`C=O`) and a hydroxyl group (`OH`).  
   - It has a rigid, fused-ring system (similar to some of the larger cyclic molecules in the examples).  
   - No halogens or heteroatoms beyond oxygen are present.  

2. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - The molecule `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property: `-1922.89902906`) is structurally similar (steroid-like, hydroxyl groups) and has a large negative value.  
   - The presence of the ketone (`C=O`) may slightly increase the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon or hydroxylated systems.  
   - Rigid, fused-ring systems with oxygen tend to have negative property values in the given examples.  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - The additional ketone group and slightly less aromatic character (compared to some examples) suggest a less negative value than `-1922.89902906` but still strongly negative.  
   - The property likely falls in the range of `-1500` to `-1000`.  

### Final Prediction:  
**Predicted Property Value:** `-1420.75000000`  

*(This is an estimate based on structural similarity to the examples, particularly the steroid-like molecules with hydroxyl groups and ketones.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 164.68010080849933
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and substituents. The molecule in question is **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, which contains the following features:

1. An acetyl group (**CC(=O)**) attached to an amine (**N**).
2. A phenyl ring (**c1ccc(cc1)**) with a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) as a substituent.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) and aromatic rings tend to have property values in the range of **~491 to ~757** (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 = 491.62121189**, **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O = 757.28816738**). The presence of the acetyl-amine (**CC(=O)N**) group may slightly increase the value compared to simpler nitroaromatics.

Additionally, molecules with multiple polar or electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro and amide) tend to have higher positive values. 

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** would be close to the higher end of the nitroaromatic range but not as high as some of the very large or halogenated compounds. 

**Predicted property value: ~650.0**  
*(A plausible interpolation based on similar structures in the dataset.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., dipole moment, energy, or another descriptorâ€”this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the given data.)*

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -893.6714439764976
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of example molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12** by identifying patterns or trends in the provided data. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with **Cl (chlorine)** often have positive property values (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` = 361.80, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` = 841.78).
   - Molecules with **P=O or P=S** (phosphorus-containing groups) are not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `CSSC` = -1421.95) tend to have negative values.
   - Aromatic systems with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) can vary widely in property values.
   - The presence of **C=O (carbonyl)** groups can lead to either positive or negative values depending on the context.

2. **Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids or fused rings) tend to have more negative values (e.g., `-1807.36`, `-2647.25`).
   - Smaller molecules (e.g., `CC#N` = -470.04, `CCC#N` = -550.71) also tend to have negative values but less extreme.

3. **Specific Cases**:
   - The molecule `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has a value of `-185.34`, which is negative despite having two Cl atoms and aromatic rings.
   - The molecule `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (with two nitro groups) has a very high positive value (`1034.54`), suggesting nitro groups contribute strongly to positive values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, which has:
- A **P=S (thiophosphate)** group (likely contributes negatively, similar to sulfur-containing groups).
- An **aromatic system with Cl** (could contribute positively, but the effect may be offset by other groups).
- A **C=O (carbonyl)** in a heterocyclic ring (variable contribution).
- **Ethoxy (OCC) groups** (no clear trend in examples, but may slightly increase the value).

Given the presence of both **Cl (positive contribution)** and **P=S/S (negative contribution)**, along with the molecule's moderate size and complexity, I predict the property value will be **negative but not extremely so**, likely in the range of other moderately negative examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-650.0** (a reasonable estimate based on the balance of Cl and P=S/S contributions, and the molecule's size). 

This is an educated guess given the lack of exact matches in the examples, but it aligns with the trends observed.

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 847.140781615469
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** by identifying patterns or trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol with a branched alkyl group (tert-butyl group) attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH). 

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a property value of **-348.37922119**.
   - **CCCC(C)O** (2-methyl-1-butanol) has a property value of **45.37865432**.
   - **CCCCC(C)O** (3-methyl-1-butanol) has a property value of **95.74637387**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) has a property value of **95.74637387** (same as above, possibly a coincidence or data error).
   - **CC(C)CO** is less branched than **CC(C)(C)CO**, and its value is negative, while more linear alcohols (like **CCCC(C)O**) have positive values.

3. **Branching Effect**: More branching tends to lower the property value (e.g., **CC(C)CO** is more negative than **CCCC(C)O**). The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched, so we might expect a lower (more negative) value than **CC(C)CO** (-348.37).

4. **Magnitude Estimate**: The difference between **CC(C)CO** (-348.37) and **CCCC(C)O** (+45.37) is roughly 400 units. Adding another branch (going from **CC(C)CO** to **CC(C)(C)CO**) might further decrease the value by a similar or slightly smaller margin. 

5. **Prediction**: A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)(C)CO** would be around **-500 to -700**, leaning toward the more negative side due to the highly branched structure.

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** to be approximately:  
**-600.0** (specific value: **-598.421753** as a plausible interpolation).

However, since the exact relationship isn't perfectly linear, and the data has some variability, this is an educated guess. If forced to pick a specific number from the trend, I'd suggest:  
**-598.421753**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, solubility, etc.â€”this is based purely on the numerical trends in the given data.)  

Final answer: **-598.421753**.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 703.4812642253994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**: 
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings (e.g., purine-like structures) tend to have property values in the range of **1000â€“1200** (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a value of **1165.72323488**, and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` has **1054.19205684**).
   - The presence of carbonyl (=O) groups in these structures further stabilizes the value in this range.

2. **Similarity to Given Examples**:
   - The target molecule is a **purine-2,6-dione** derivative (hypoxanthine-like structure), which is highly analogous to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` in terms of nitrogen content and carbonyl groups.
   - The absence of substituents like fluorine (F) or additional functional groups suggests the value may be slightly lower than the fluorinated example (1165.72) but close to the unsubstituted example (1054.19).

3. **Trend in Values**:
   - Molecules with conjugated systems and hydrogen-bonding capabilities (e.g., NH groups) often have positive property values in this range.
   - The double-bonded oxygen (=O) and NH groups in the target molecule suggest strong contributions similar to the examples.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (value = **1054.19205684**) and accounting for the additional nitrogen and carbonyl group in the target molecule, the predicted property value is likely slightly higher. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1100.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., molecular polarizability, heat of formation, or another quantum-chemical descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 173.5949792702675
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate, with the structure CHâ‚ƒ-COO-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)).

### Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Functional Groups and Trends**:
   - **Esters (R-COO-R')**: The molecule **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester) has a very high positive value (2253.71), while **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid ester) has a large negative value (-2026.31). Esters seem to span a wide range, but simpler esters like methyl acetate may not follow extreme trends.
   - **Ethers (R-O-R')**: **CCOC(C)C** (an ether) has a value of -84.70, while **CCOC=C** (an enol ether) has -610.36. Ethers tend to have moderate negative values.
   - **Carbonyls (C=O)**: Aldehydes/ketones like **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (a methoxy benzaldehyde) have positive values (327.96), while **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate) is not in the data, but simpler carbonyls like **CC(=O)C** (acetone) are not directly listed.

2. **Simple Alcohols vs. Esters**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of -758.48, while **CCCCCC(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has -13.26. Alcohols are mostly negative but vary widely.
   - **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester derived from isopropanol and acetic acid. Given that esters can be positive or negative, but simpler ones may lean toward moderate values.

3. **Hybrid Effects**:
   - The ester **CC(C)OC=O** combines an ether-like (C-O) and carbonyl (C=O) component. The ether part may pull the value negative, while the carbonyl could push it positive. The net effect is unclear, but simpler esters in the data (like **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**) are highly positive, while others are negative.

### Prediction:
Given the lack of direct analogs in the data, I will interpolate:
- The ester **CC(C)OC=O** is simpler than the phosphate ester (2253.71) and the steroid ester (-2026.31), so it likely falls in between.
- The ether **CCOC(C)C** is at -84.70, and the carbonyl **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** is at +327.96. A weighted average might land near a small positive value.
- Given that **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) is -758.48, converting it to an ester (adding C=O) might increase the value significantly (e.g., by ~1000 units), landing near **+250**.

However, looking at **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...** (-2026.31), a complex ester is very negative, while **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** is very positive. For a small ester like methyl acetate, I will guess a **moderate positive value**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O: 215.0**  
*(This is an estimate based on interpolation; the actual value could vary significantly.)*

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -1464.8133169742566
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and presence of carbonyl or other polar groups. 

The molecule in question is:  
**O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**  

This is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms (a diphenylurea structure). It has the following features:
1. A central carbonyl (C=O) group, which is polar and often contributes positively to the property value.
2. Two aromatic rings (phenyl groups), which are relatively stable but not as polar as other functional groups.
3. No halogens or other highly polar substituents, which in the examples tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., Cl, Br, F).

From the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups (but no halogens) tend to have moderate property values (e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` has a value of 199.45840951, `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has 491.62121189).
- The presence of two phenyl groups and a urea linkage suggests a moderate property value, likely higher than simple aromatic compounds but lower than heavily halogenated or highly polar molecules.

Given this, a reasonable estimate for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** would be around **600 Â± 100**. 

**Predicted property value: 550.0**

Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, aromaticity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings (two benzene rings fused to a central cyclopentadiene ring).

From the examples:
- Aromatic molecules with two fused rings (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to have property values around **-1000** (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` has a value of **-999.35023842**).
- Fluorene has an additional cyclopentadiene ring compared to naphthalene, which may slightly increase the magnitude of the property value due to added conjugation and rigidity.

Given this trend, a reasonable estimate for the property value of fluorene would be slightly more negative than the naphthalene-like example above. 

**Predicted property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene):**  
**-1050.0** (approximate, based on the observed trend).

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 617.1349520345718
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of example molecules and their corresponding property values, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** by analyzing structural features and trends from the provided data.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NHâ‚‚, -NOâ‚‚, -SOâ‚‚-) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -1202.33 for the first molecule with amide and carbonyl groups).
   - Nonpolar or hydrophobic molecules (e.g., long alkanes like C20H42) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 317.17 for C20H42).

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -Cl, -NOâ‚‚) often correlate with negative values (e.g., -273.46 for Cl-substituted biphenyl).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., -NHâ‚‚) may have less negative or positive values, depending on other substituents.

3. **Sulfonamides and Sulfonyl Groups**:
   - The molecule **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O** (with a sulfonamide-like group) has a property value of **-344.22**.
   - The sulfonyl group (=SOâ‚‚) is highly polar and often correlates with negative values.

4. **Nitrogen-Rich Molecules**:
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms (e.g., **Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c12**) can have positive or negative values, but the sulfonyl group's polarity likely dominates here.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**
- The molecule contains:
  - A **sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))** linked to an aromatic ring.
  - An **aromatic ring with an electron-donating -NHâ‚‚ group** (opposite to Cl-substituted examples).
  - A **guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N)**, which is polar and may contribute to a negative value.
- The sulfonyl group is strongly polar, similar to the example with a value of -344.22, but the additional -NHâ‚‚ group may reduce the negativity slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity of the sulfonamide and the guanidine-like group, I predict a **negative property value**. Comparing to similar molecules:
- The sulfonamide example had -344.22, but this molecule has additional polar groups (-NHâ‚‚ and NC(=N)N).
- The aromatic -NHâ‚‚ may slightly offset the negativity, but the overall polarity is still high.

**Predicted property value: -500.0** (approximate, considering the combined effects of the sulfonyl, guanidine, and aromatic amine groups).

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The value is likely in the range of -400 to -600.)

Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule:  
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**:  
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` = 659.738, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` = 110.990).  
   - The presence of multiple nitro groups may further increase the value.

2. **Fluorinated groups (C(F)(F)F)**:  
   - Fluorinated substituents (e.g., `C2(F)` in some steroids) seem to correlate with negative values, but the effect is not dominant compared to nitro groups.

3. **Aromatic systems with substitutions**:  
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) often have positive contributions (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` = -929.914, but this also has other complex features).  

4. **Aliphatic chains and unsaturated groups**:  
   - Simple alkenes (e.g., `CCCCCCCC=C` = -112.022) or alkyl groups tend to have small or negative contributions unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
- The molecule has:  
  - Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), which likely contribute positively.  
  - A trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`), which may slightly reduce the value.  
  - An aromatic ring with substitutions, similar to some examples.  
  - A tertiary amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`), which is neutral or slightly negative in the examples.  

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (1 nitro group) = 659.738  
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (no nitro, but polar groups) = 110.990  
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (1 nitro + complex structure) = -929.914  

Given the two nitro groups and the trifluoromethyl group, the value is likely positive but moderated by the fluorine and aliphatic parts.  

### Predicted property value:
**Approximately 400 to 600**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 485.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on trends in the data, not a rigorous calculation.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 173.5949792702675
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given examples:
1. **Functional groups and polarity**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2, -C=O) tend to have a wide range of property values, both positive and negative.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCCCCCC1) tend to have large negative values.
   - Halogenated compounds (e.g., ClC(Cl)Cl, Clc1ccccc1) often have large positive values, but there are exceptions (e.g., ClC=C has a large negative value).

2. **Oxygen-containing groups**:
   - Alcohols (e.g., CCCCCO, -242.8; CCC(O)CC, 59.62) can have moderate negative or positive values.
   - Esters (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1, 246.75) tend to have positive values.
   - Aldehydes (e.g., CCCC=O, -610.36) can have large negative values.

3. **Structure of CC(C)OC=O**:
   - This is an ester (methyl acetate-like structure with an isopropyl group: isopropyl formate, **CH3-CH(CH3)-O-CH=O**).
   - It has an aldehyde-like carbonyl (C=O) attached to an ether oxygen (O), which is polar.

4. Similar molecules in the examples:
   - **CC(=O)N**: 152.49 (amide)
   - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1**: 246.75 (ester)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 58.78 (ester with an amine)
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C**: 201.58 (ester)

   Esters in the examples tend to have positive values in the range ~50 to ~250.

5. **CC(C)OC=O** is simpler than most esters in the examples (no aromatic rings or additional functional groups), so its value might be on the lower end of the ester range.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CC(C)OC=O** is likely to have a positive property value, similar to other esters but slightly lower due to its simplicity. A reasonable estimate would be around **150-200**.

Looking at the closest analog (**CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 58.78, but this has an aromatic ring and amine, which may increase complexity), and considering the simplicity of **CC(C)OC=O**, a slightly higher value than **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** but lower than **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (246.75) seems plausible.

### Final predicted value:
**173.32** (similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O**, which is 173.32492393 in the examples and has a somewhat comparable structure). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**173.32**

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 841.7813122608621
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** by identifying patterns or trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Structural Features of the Molecule**:
   - The molecule is a substituted phenol with two methyl groups (one at position 1 and one at position 3) and a hydroxyl group at position 4.
   - It is aromatic and has moderate polarity due to the hydroxyl group.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a property value of **567.67417333**.
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **-1466.19707118**, but this is much larger and less polar.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (a dimethylbenzene-like structure) is not directly in the examples, but simpler alkylbenzenes like **CCc1ccccc1C** have values around **539.27351007**.
   - The hydroxyl group tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., phenol vs. benzene derivatives).

3. **Effect of Substitution**:
   - Adding methyl groups to phenol (as in **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**) might slightly decrease the property value compared to phenol itself due to increased hydrophobicity, but the hydroxyl group still dominates.
   - The examples show that polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -Br) often lead to higher positive values, while nonpolar or halogenated structures can have negative or lower positive values.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule is similar to phenol but with two methyl groups. Given that phenol is **567.67417333** and **CCc1ccccc1C** is **539.27351007**, I would expect the value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** to be slightly lower than phenol but still positive and in the same general range.
   - A reasonable estimate would be between **500 and 550**.

5. **Final Guess**:
   - Considering the examples and trends, I predict the property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** to be approximately **520.0**.

### Predicted Property Value: **520.0** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the data). 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For precise predictions, computational methods or a larger training dataset would be needed.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 346.32101989852595
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** by identifying patterns or similarities with the given molecules.

### Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate-containing molecules**: 
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) all have the **same property value of 648.08161524**, regardless of the halogen substitution (Cl, Br, I). This suggests that the core **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment dominates the property value, and substitutions on the aromatic ring do not significantly alter it.

2. **Aromatic substitutions**:
   - The molecule in question, **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, has a **methylthio (SC)** and a **methyl (C)** substitution on the aromatic ring. While these are not halogens, the examples suggest that the property is robust to changes in the aromatic substituents as long as the **COP(=S)(OC)O** core is present.

3. **Other fragments**:
   - The **SC** (methylthio) group is not explicitly present in the training examples, but the consistency of the property for the **COP(=S)(OC)O** core suggests that minor substitutions (like SC or C) may not significantly affect the value.

### Prediction:
Since the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment appears to dictate the property value (648.08161524 in all cases), and the aromatic substitutions (Cl, Br, I, etc.) do not change it, I predict that the property for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** will also be:

**Predicted property value: 648.08161524**

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 97.80747934292637
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the property value.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **58.89441397**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **271.41661465**
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **1392.78251585**
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**: Property = **841.78131226**

   These examples show that increasing the number of chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, but the exact trend is not linear. The presence of other substituents (like -OH) also significantly affects the value.

2. **Structure Similarity**:
   - The target molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is very similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, but with one fewer chlorine atom on the second ring (replacing a Cl with H). 

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **271.41661465**,
- The target molecule has one fewer chlorine (less electron-withdrawing effect), which would likely reduce the property value slightly.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than 271.41661465 but higher than 58.89441397 (the value for the less chlorinated analog). 

#### Predicted Property Value:
**~150.0** (approximate, based on interpolation between the two closest examples). 

However, looking more carefully:
- The difference between **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (58.89) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (271.42) is ~212.52 for adding one more Cl.
- The target molecule is intermediate in chlorination between these two, so a rough estimate would be halfway: ~(58.89 + 271.42)/2 â‰ˆ **165.16**.

But the target molecule is not exactly intermediate; it has one fewer Cl than the 271.42 case, so a better estimate might be closer to **~200**. 

Given the uncertainty, I would predict a value around **200.0**. 

### Final Answer:
**200.0** (approximate prediction based on similar chlorinated aromatic examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 206.123426997196
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features. For instance:

- Simple alkanes like **CCC** and **CC** have negative values (-2071.55558583 and -3274.75897215, respectively).
- Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or conjugated systems tend to have higher positive values (e.g., **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** = 1068.56275509).
- The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) or polar groups can shift the value significantly in either direction.

The molecule to predict is **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane). Key features:
1. A small alkane chain (3 carbons).
2. A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.

Comparing to similar examples:
- **CCC** = -2071.55558583 (pure alkane, very negative).
- **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** = 1263.21073164 (multiple nitro groups, highly positive).
- **Nc1ccccc1O** = 783.21946199 (nitro-like polarity but aromatic).

The nitro group in **CCCN(=O)=O** will likely increase the property value compared to **CCC**, but not as much as in highly conjugated or multi-nitro systems. Given the examples, I estimate a value in the mid-range positive region.

**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 186.92716433**  
*(This aligns with the trend where a single nitro group on a small alkane gives a moderate positive value, similar to the second example in the training data: **OCC(NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)C(O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** = 186.92716433, which also has a nitro group and polar moieties.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, particularly with the presence and type of substituents (halogens like Cl, Br, F, functional groups like NO2, COOH, etc.), as well as the size and complexity of the molecule.

Let's analyze the given molecule: **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (4-bromofluorobenzene).

This is a benzene ring substituted with a fluorine (F) and a bromine (Br). Comparing this to similar molecules in the examples:

1. **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: 588.56456125): This is a benzene ring with Cl and Br substituents (similar to our molecule but with Cl instead of F). The property value is positive and moderately large.
2. **COc1ccccc1Cl** (property: 539.27351007): This is a benzene ring with OCH3 and Cl substituents. The property value is also positive and somewhat similar to the first example.
3. **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property: -189.37688705): This is a more complex molecule with multiple Cl substituents, and the property is negative.

Fluorine (F) is smaller and more electronegative than chlorine (Cl), but bromine (Br) is larger and less electronegative than chlorine. Given that, we might expect the property for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** to be somewhat similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but adjusted for the difference between F and Cl.

Given that F is smaller and more electronegative than Cl, the property might be slightly higher than that of **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (588.56456125), but not drastically so. 

A reasonable prediction would be in the range of **600 to 650**. Averaging this and considering the examples, a plausible estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 620.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

However, looking back at the examples, the values don't seem to follow a simple additive pattern, so this is an approximate guess based on similarity to the given data. 

For a more precise prediction, a model trained on these examples would be needed, but based on the given data, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 620.0**

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -620.7354845364524
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** by analyzing structural patterns and their associated property values in the dataset.

### Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Hydrocarbon Skeletons with Oxygen Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with simple hydrocarbon skeletons and oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, ketones) tend to have property values in the range of **hundreds to low thousands** (positive or negative). 
     - Example: `CC(C)(C)CO` (tertiary alcohol) has a value of **847.14078162**.
     - Example: `CCCOCCC` (ether) has a value of **-523.37967575**.
     - Example: `CC1CCCO1` (cyclic ether) has a value of **-1023.99242838**.

2. **Cyclic Structures**:
   - Cyclic hydrocarbons with oxygen functional groups often have negative values, especially if the ring is strained or contains multiple functional groups.
     - Example: `CC1CCCO1` (5-membered cyclic ether) has a value of **-1023.99242838**.
     - Example: `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **-1144.7624972**.

3. **Steroids and Polycyclic Terpenes**:
   - Larger polycyclic structures (e.g., steroids) with multiple functional groups (e.g., ketones, alcohols) tend to have highly negative values.
     - Example: `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO` has a value of **-2064.13003522**.

4. **Specific Case of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**:
   - This is a **bicyclic terpene-like structure** with a tertiary alcohol and two fused rings (one cyclohexane and one cyclopentane). 
   - It resembles fragments of steroids or terpenes but is simpler (no ketones or additional functional groups).
   - Based on the examples, similar structures (e.g., `CC1CCCO1`) have negative values around **-1000**, while more complex steroids have values closer to **-2000**.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** (no ketones, only one alcohol, and two fused rings), its property value is likely **less negative** than the steroid examples but still negative due to the cyclic strain and alcohol group. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-800 and -1200**. 

Looking at the closest example:
- `CC1CCCO1` (cyclic ether) has a value of **-1023.99242838**.
- `CC(C)(C)CO` (tertiary alcohol) has a value of **847.14078162** (positive, but this is a simpler acyclic case).

Since **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is more complex than `CC1CCCO1` but less complex than steroids, I predict a value slightly less negative than `CC1CCCO1`. 

### Final Prediction:
**-900.0** (approximate, likely between -800 and -1000). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -518.212647390944
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` by comparing its structural features to those in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (`P(=S)(OCC)OCC`)**: This functional group appears in one of the examples:
   - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a property value of **-863.33847375**.
   The main difference here is the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` in the target molecule.

2. **Lactam Ring (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure (a cyclic imide with a benzene ring). Similar structures in the dataset:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **-668.55950511**.
   - `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` has a value of **-776.21286381**.

3. **Combined Features**: The target molecule combines a phosphorothioate group with a phthalimide-like lactam. The phosphorothioate group tends to contribute negatively (as seen in the example with -863.338), while the lactam/imide group also contributes negatively (examples around -600 to -800).

### Prediction:
The target molecule is structurally similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = -863.338), but with a slightly less bulky substituent (phthalimide instead of `SC(CCl)`). The phthalimide group is likely to reduce the magnitude of the negative property compared to the thiolate group. 

Given this, I would predict the property for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` to be slightly less negative than -863.338, perhaps in the range of **-700 to -800**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-780.0** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

However, if we consider the exact match for the phosphorothioate + lactam combination, a more precise guess might be closer to the average of similar structures, such as **-800.0**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-800.0** (rounded estimate based on structural similarity to the provided examples). 

(Note: Without a direct match or computational tools, this is an educated guess based on the given data.)

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -66.17094781214729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole, or carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` (pyrrole fused to benzene) has a value of **-152.786**.
     - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (uracil-like structure) has a value of **614.374**, but this is an exception due to additional aliphatic chains.
   - The presence of a carbonyl (=O) in an aromatic system often lowers the property value (e.g., `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has **-711.247**).

2. **Substituted Aromatic Systems**:
   - Methyl groups (`C` or `Cc`) on aromatic rings can slightly increase the property value (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C` has **997.961**), but when combined with electronegative atoms or carbonyls, the effect is overshadowed.

3. **Specific Structure Similarity**:
   - The molecule `Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C` is a **diketone-substituted diazole** (similar to a benzodiazepine or hydantoin core). 
   - Compare to `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` (hydantoin with phenyl), which has a value of **-355.157**. The additional aromatic ring and carbonyls in the target molecule suggest a more negative value.

4. **Nitrogen and Carbonyl Impact**:
   - The two nitrogens and a carbonyl in the 5-membered ring (`cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C`) will strongly lower the property value, similar to other N-heterocycles with carbonyls (e.g., `CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3` has **-1196.632**).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to hydantoin-like systems and the presence of two aromatic rings with a carbonyl and nitrogens, the property value is likely **negative and moderately large**. A reasonable estimate is between **-400 and -600**, closer to the hydantoin example (-355.157) but more negative due to the additional aromatic ring.

#### Final Predicted Value:
**-520.0** (approximate, based on structural trends in the data). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., energy, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.*

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 626.4281594936748
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - **CCOC(=O)N**: 206.123427 (small ester)
     - **CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2**: -1473.79583065 (complex ester with aromatic rings and multiple substituents)
     - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: 435.17176855 (larger ester with a long alkyl chain)
   - **Carboxylic Acids (RCOOH)**: 
     - Not directly present in the examples, but esters are derivatives of carboxylic acids.
   - **Alkyl Chains**:
     - Longer alkyl chains tend to have more negative values (e.g., **CCCCC**: -1011.62929919).
   - **Polar Groups (e.g., OH, Cl, Br)**:
     - Polar groups can significantly affect the property, often increasing the value (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)CO**: 1082.81966639).

2. **Ethyl Hexanoate (CCCCCC(=O)OCC)**:
   - This is a simple ester with a 6-carbon alkyl chain (hexanoate) and an ethyl group (OCC).
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate): 435.17176855 (9-carbon chain, methyl ester).
     - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): 206.123427 (small ethyl ester).
   - Ethyl hexanoate has a shorter chain than methyl nonanoate but is larger than ethyl carbamate. The property value is likely between these two, but closer to methyl nonanoate due to the longer alkyl chain.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** should be positive and moderately sized, similar to other esters with medium-length alkyl chains.
   - A reasonable estimate is **~400 to 500**, based on the trend from the examples.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is **450.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For precise predictions, computational methods or more extensive training data would be needed.)

Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `COC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is methyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring with an ester group (`COC=O`). 

From the examples, we can compare it to similar structures:
1. `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-56.66275603**.
2. `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) has a property value of **58.78292441**.
3. `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC` (a larger ester) has a property value of **-420.3347786**.

The ester group (`COC=O`) appears to contribute negatively to the property value, while aromaticity and additional substituents can modulate it. Since methyl benzoate is smaller than ethyl benzoate but structurally very similar, its property value should be close to that of ethyl benzoate but slightly less negative (due to the smaller alkyl group).

**Prediction:** The property value for `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` is likely slightly higher (less negative) than `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (-56.66275603). A reasonable estimate would be around **-40.0**.

However, looking more carefully, the difference between methyl and ethyl might not be large, so another plausible estimate is close to the ethyl benzoate value, perhaps **-50.0**.

Given the variability in the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: -50.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to ethyl benzoate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -132.40052430167842
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure in a way that is not immediately obvious from simple descriptors like molecular weight or functional groups alone. However, some patterns emerge:

1. **Conjugated systems or aromaticity**: Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher (less negative) property values. For example:
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene-like structure) has a value of **509.85440825**.
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` (polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **-778.99458113**.

2. **Saturation and chain length**: Saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CC`) tend to have higher positive values, while shorter unsaturated chains (e.g., `CC/C=C/C`) have negative values.

3. **Halogens and electronegative atoms**: The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) can significantly increase the property value, especially in aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Br` has **783.21946199**).

4. **Functional groups**: Polar or complex functional groups (e.g., amides, esters, nitro groups) can lead to large positive or negative values, but the trend is less clear.

### Prediction for `C=CCC=C`:
This molecule is a linear conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene-like structure). From the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (a simple alkene) has a value of **-190.84541381**.
- `C=Cc1ccccc1` (conjugated with an aromatic ring) has **509.85440825**.

Since `C=CCC=C` is conjugated but lacks aromaticity or additional functional groups, its value is likely intermediate. Given that conjugation increases the value compared to isolated double bonds, but not as much as aromaticity, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than `CC/C=C/C` but lower than `C=Cc1ccccc1`.

**Predicted property value for `C=CCC=C`: ~100 to 200**. 

However, looking more closely, the only other conjugated diene-like structure in the examples is `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene), which has **509.85440825**, but this is also aromatic. For a non-aromatic conjugated diene, the value is likely lower. 

Given the lack of exact matches, a conservative estimate based on the trend would be:
**Predicted property value: ~ -100 to 0**.

Given the examples, the closest analog is `CC/C=C/C` (-190.84541381), and since `C=CCC=C` is more conjugated, its value should be less negative. 

**Final predicted value: ~ -50**. 

However, this is uncertain without a clearer trend. If forced to pick a specific number, I would guess:
**-120.0** (interpolating between `CC/C=C/C` and other unsaturated examples). 

But this is highly speculative. A better approach would require more data or a clear model. 

**Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable single-point estimate is: -120.0**. 

(Note: This is a rough guess based on limited analogous data. In practice, such predictions require a trained model or more examples.)

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -758.4780452032995
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular weight and the presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F, I), which tend to increase the property value significantly. The molecule in question is **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), which has three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon.

From the examples:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a molecule with F, Cl, and Br) has a property value of **1555.58830161**.
- **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (a brominated aromatic) has a property value of **201.64530593**.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a heavily chlorinated molecule) has a property value of **271.41661465**.
- **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a molecule with Cl and other groups) has a property value of **3678.1107404**.

**BrC(Br)Br** has three bromine atoms, which are heavier and more polarizable than chlorine atoms, so we expect a high property value. Comparing to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (which has one Br and one Cl), **BrC(Br)Br** should have a higher value due to the additional bromines. 

A reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** would be in the range of **2000â€“4000**, leaning toward the higher end due to the three bromines. 

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: ~3000.00000000** (exact value uncertain, but likely in this range based on the trend). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the highest values are for molecules with multiple heavy atoms (e.g., P, S, Cl, Br). Since **BrC(Br)Br** is simpler but has three Br atoms, a more precise estimate might be closer to **2500â€“3000**. 

Given the lack of exact comparables, a plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 2800.00000000** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.) 

---  
**Final answer: ~2800.00000000** (likely higher due to three Br atoms, but exact value uncertain).  

If forced to pick a single value: **2800.00000000**.  

(For context, the value for **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** is 1555.59, so three Br atoms would reasonably exceed that.)

**Refined prediction: 2800.00000000**.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -758.4780452032995
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular weight, polarity, and presence of halogens (especially bromine and chlorine) or other functional groups. 

The molecule in question is **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane). 

From the examples:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a property value of **1555.58830161**. This molecule contains fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, and its value is high due to the presence of multiple halogens.
- **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a property value of **201.64530593**, which is lower than the previous example but still significant due to the presence of bromine.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a property value of **271.41661465**, again showing that multiple halogens increase the value.

**BrC(Br)Br** has three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon, which is highly polarizable and heavy due to the bromines. Comparing this to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**, which has a value of ~1555, **BrC(Br)Br** lacks fluorine (which is very electronegative) but has three bromines instead. Bromine is less electronegative than fluorine but more polarizable and heavier, which likely contributes to a high property value, though perhaps not as high as the fluorine-containing example.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** would be in the range of **1200â€“1400**. 

A precise prediction based on the trend would be approximately **1320.0**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is:  
**1320.0** (estimated). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples and trends.)

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -863.3384737494688
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, it appears that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, halogens, and other substituents. The values range widely from negative to positive, with some patterns:

- **Aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene derivatives) often contribute positively unless heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups or halogens.
- **Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I)** tend to increase the property value, especially when multiple are present.
- **Polar or charged groups** (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl, carbonyl) can significantly affect the value, sometimes increasing it.
- **Aliphatic chains** or non-polar groups (e.g., alkyl) may contribute negatively or modestly depending on context.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

Breaking this down:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Likely contributes positively (similar to P(=S) in the example `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which has a value of **226.677**).
2. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Neutral or modest contribution.
3. **Chloromethyl group (C(CCl))**: Chlorine likely adds positively.
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: Aromatic ring with carbonylsâ€”similar to other aromatic carbonyl examples (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` has **909.917**, but this is sulfonamide; `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1` has **-252.874**). The lactam here may contribute less than sulfonamide but more than simple amides.
5. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Typically positive, but modified by substituents.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The phosphorothioate group is similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (**226.677**), but the target molecule has additional complexity (lactam, extra Cl).
- The lactam + aromatic resembles `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (**-862.766**), but the phosphorothioate group likely dominates over the lactam's negative contribution.

### Prediction:
The phosphorothioate group and chlorine suggest a positive value, but the lactam may offset this slightly. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is between **200 and 500**. 

A plausible prediction is:  
**~350.0** (specific value: **347.892**). 

This balances the positive contributions of P(=S) and Cl with the moderating effects of the lactam and aromatic system. 

### Final Answer:
**347.892** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -668.5595051099951
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, it appears that the property in question is likely related to the **heat of formation (Î”Hf)** or a similar thermodynamic property, as the values span a wide range and include both positive and negative numbers, which is typical for such properties.

To predict the property for the new molecule:  
**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's break it down structurally and compare it to the provided examples:

### Key structural features and comparisons:
1. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)C` (1016.50) and `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (1764.75). The latter is closer due to the additional N-substitution.
2. **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: Seen in `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (533.34) and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (1177.24). Chlorine substitutions tend to increase the property value.
3. **Heterocyclic group (n2nc(oc2=O))**: Similar to `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (-75.14), but the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) here may increase the value.
4. **Tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: Seen in `CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3` (-2220.63), but this is a much larger molecule. Smaller alkyl groups like `CC(C)C` (-348.38) suggest a negative contribution, but the context matters.

### Estimation:
- The amide with N-substitution (`CN(C)C(=O)N`) is a major contributor, likely in the range of **1000â€“1500** based on `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (1764.75) and `CN(C)C(=O)C` (1016.50).
- The aromatic Cl substitution adds **~500â€“600** (from `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` at 533.34).
- The heterocycle with C=O might add **~200â€“300** (balancing the negative value of simpler heterocycles).
- The tert-butyl group could subtract **~200â€“300** (from smaller alkyl group trends).

### Predicted value:
Combining these, the molecule's property value is likely in the range of **1200â€“1600**. Given the similarities to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (1764.75) but with additional stabilizing features (Cl, heterocycle), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 1420.0** (rounded to one decimal place). 

This is an estimate based on additive contributions and comparisons to the provided examples. For higher accuracy, computational methods or more training data would be needed.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -780.4365964042111
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I)**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl) tend to have higher positive property values. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` â†’ **853.20088219**
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` â†’ **1392.78251585**
     - `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N` â†’ **1577.51875343**
   - The property seems to increase with the number of halogens.

2. **Presence of Oxygen (O)**:
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., -OH, -O-) often contribute to higher positive values, especially when combined with halogens. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` â†’ **853.20088219**
     - `OCC(O)C(O)CO` â†’ **1082.81966639**

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens and oxygen substituents tend to have high positive values. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` â†’ **853.20088219**
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` â†’ **1392.78251585**

4. **Negative Values**:
   - Molecules with fewer halogens or more aliphatic/neutral groups tend to have negative values. For example:
     - `CCCCBr` â†’ **-729.39117821**
     - `CCCc1ccccc1` â†’ **-205.13169405**

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which has:
- Two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen bridge (`Oc1...Oc2`).
- Three chlorine substituents (two on one ring, one on the other).
- Two hydroxyl groups (-OH).

This structure is similar to:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (1 ring, 2 Cl, 1 OH) â†’ **853.20088219**
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (1 ring, 4 Cl, 1 OH) â†’ **1392.78251585**

The target molecule has:
- More aromatic rings (2 vs. 1) and more oxygen bridges than the examples.
- Fewer Cl atoms (3) than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl), but more than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2 Cl).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
1. The presence of two aromatic rings with oxygen bridges and hydroxyl groups will significantly increase the property value.
2. The three chlorine atoms will further increase the value, but not as much as four chlorines (as in the second example above).

Interpolating between the two closest examples:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2 Cl) â†’ **853.20**
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl) â†’ **1392.78**

The target has 3 Cl, so the value should be between these two. The increase per Cl is roughly:
- (1392.78 - 853.20) / 2 â‰ˆ 269.79 per additional Cl.

Thus, for 3 Cl:  
**853.20 + 269.79 â‰ˆ 1122.99**

Additionally, the second aromatic ring with an oxygen bridge will add to the value. From other examples, aromatic systems with oxygen bridges contribute significantly (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` â†’ **1082.82**). 

Given this, I estimate the property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** to be approximately:

### Predicted Property Value: **1250.0** (rounded to a reasonable estimate based on the trends). 

(Note: The exact value depends on the specific property being measured, but this is a plausible interpolation given the data.)

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -190.84541380573052
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as functional groups, conjugation, halogenation, ring systems, and overall molecular complexity. 

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C`, which is trans-2-pentene (a simple alkene with a trans double bond). 

From the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (likely cis-2-butene or similar) has a property value of `-190.84541381`.
- `CCCC(=O)OC` (a simple ester) has a value of `531.7966918`.
- `CCCC(C)C` (a branched alkane) has a value of `-181.72332305`.

Given that `CC/C=C/C` is a simple alkene (similar in complexity to `CCCC(C)C` but with a double bond), and comparing it to the provided examples, the property value for `CC/C=C\C` (trans-2-pentene) should be close to that of `CC/C=C/C` but slightly more negative due to the slightly larger size and trans configuration (which may have a small effect on the property).

Thus, a reasonable prediction for `CC/C=C\C` would be:

**Predicted property value: -195.0** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trend). 

This is slightly more negative than `CC/C=C/C` (-190.845) due to the additional carbon and trans configuration, but still in the same general range as other simple alkenes/alkanes in the dataset.

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -729.391178214291
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight, though the exact nature of the property (e.g., energy, solubility, etc.) isn't explicitly stated. 

For the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether, C4H10O), we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:
1. **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a property value of **-758.4780452**.
2. **CCC(O)CC** (2-pentanol) has a property value of **59.62313807**.
3. **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a property value of **622.0621812**.

Diethyl ether (**CCCOCC**) is a simple ether with no additional functional groups or halogens, so its property value should be intermediate between small alcohols and slightly larger esters. 

Given the trend:
- Smaller/aliphatic molecules with oxygen (like isopropanol) have negative values.
- Larger or more substituted molecules (like isopropyl acetate) have positive values.
- Ethers are less polar than alcohols but similar in size to small alcohols.

A reasonable estimate for **CCCOCC** would be close to **CCC(O)CC** (2-pentanol), but slightly less polar, so likely a bit lower. 

**Predicted property value for CCCOCC: ~ -200.0** (approximate based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The true value may differ if the property is something more specific like heat of formation or another quantum-chemical parameter.)

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1155.886938814363
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to vary widely based on molecular structure, functional groups, and complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**

This structure features:
1. A tertiary amide group (N(C=O)) linked to two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) and a bulky tert-butyl-like group (C(C)(C)).
2. Two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2) attached to the nitrogen of the amide.
3. No strongly polar or charged groups beyond the amide, and no halogens or other heteroatoms.

From the examples, we can observe trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and amide/carbonyl groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -2033.47629285).
- Bulky hydrophobic groups (e.g., tert-butyl or multiple phenyls) often reduce the property value further.
- Simpler aromatic amides (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1`) have less negative values (e.g., -165.07637253).

Given this, the molecule is likely to have a **negative property value** due to the amide and aromatic rings, but not as extreme as highly polar or polycyclic examples. A reasonable estimate would be between **-1000 and -2000**.

Looking closely at similar structures:
- `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a value of -2033.47629285 (more polar due to the thiazole ring).
- `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` has -2026.69265653 (bulky but no aromatics).
- `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenylmethane-like) has -1454.7736867.

This molecule is less polar than the first two but more aromatic than the third. A plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: -1700.0** (rounded to a reasonable estimate based on the trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, solubility parameter, etc.â€”this is an empirical guess based on the given data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 25.623790100389492
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Bromine (Br) Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with a single Br substituent on an aromatic ring tend to have property values in the range of **~440 to ~674**.
     - Example: `c2ccc1scnc1c2` (no Br) = 440.689, but `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` (one Br) = 674.491.
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (one Br) = 588.565.
   - Multiple Br substituents increase the value further (e.g., `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` = 853.201).

2. **Amide Group (-NHC=O)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups tend to have **negative or lower positive values**.
     - Example: `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = -1155.887.
     - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = -720.623.
   - However, the effect depends on the rest of the structure.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with no polar substituents have moderate positive values (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` = 997.961).
   - Polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -Br) can lower or raise the value depending on their electronegativity and position.

4. **Combined Features**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has:
     - An aromatic ring with a Br substituent (tends to increase value to ~500-700).
     - An amide group (-NHC=O) attached to the ring (tends to decrease value or counteract the Br effect).

---

### Prediction for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- The Br substituent alone would suggest a value around **~588** (similar to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 588.565).
- The amide group (-NHC=O) is likely to reduce this value, but not as drastically as in highly polar/charged amides (e.g., the negative values in the examples are for more complex or multiple amides).
- A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than 588, accounting for the amide's effect.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 545.466**  
*(This matches the value of `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` = 545.466, which has a similar balance of aromatic Br and polar carbonyl group.)*

Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, branching, and heteroatoms. 

The molecule in question is **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, which is isobutylbenzene. It consists of a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent (a branched 4-carbon chain). 

From the examples, similar molecules include:
- **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): 783.21946199
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): 301.73211804
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): 324.93519743
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): 509.85440825
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon): -493.84198353

The isobutyl group is more branched than ethyl or methyl but less complex than polyaromatic systems. Given the trend, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** should fall between the values for simpler aromatic systems (like toluene) and more complex ones (like polyaromatics). 

Considering the examples of substituted benzenes:
- Ethyltoluene (less branching): 301.73211804
- Isopropyltoluene (more branching): 324.93519743

The isobutyl group introduces additional branching, which may slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains. However, it is not as extreme as polyaromatic systems. 

A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** would be slightly higher than isopropyltoluene but not drastically so. 

**Predicted property value: ~350.0** (e.g., 350.0 Â± 20, based on interpolation from similar structures). 

For precision, I'll predict:  
**Predicted property value: 347.52183000**  

(This is an educated guess based on the trend; the actual value may vary depending on the exact property being modeled.)

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 509.8544082515718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### 1. Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
   - The molecule is **phenylacetaldehyde**, consisting of a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to an aldehyde group (**-CHO**) via a methylene bridge (**-CH2-**).
   - Simplified representation: **Ph-CH2-CHO** (where Ph is phenyl).

### 2. Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
   - **Benzene derivatives with simple substituents**:
     - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): Property = 207.69868069  
       (Methoxy group attached to benzene)
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (paracetamol-like): Property = 817.58608825  
       (Amide and hydroxyl groups attached to benzene)
     - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): Property = 1034.53521945  
       (Two nitro groups attached to benzene)
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polycyclic aromatic): Property = -935.15855101  
       (Complex fused rings)
   - **Benzene with carbonyl-containing substituents**:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = 817.58608825  
       (Amide + hydroxyl)
     - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: Property = -935.16628966  
       (Complex urea derivative with two phenyl groups)
   - **Aldehyde-containing molecules**:
     - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1**: Property = -46.61456884  
       (Cyclic ketone, not directly comparable)
     - No direct example of a simple phenylacetaldehyde, but we can infer from substituent effects.

### 3. Key Observations:
   - The presence of a **benzene ring** tends to contribute positively to the property (e.g., anisole = 207.69).
   - Adding **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, aldehyde)** increases the property value (e.g., dinitrobenzene = 1034.53).
   - The **aldehyde group (-CHO)** is moderately electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro groups.
   - The **methylene bridge (-CH2-)** in phenylacetaldehyde slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect compared to a direct attachment (e.g., benzaldehyde would likely have a higher value).

### 4. Estimating the Property:
   - Anisole (methoxybenzene) has a property of ~207.69. Replacing the methoxy with an aldehyde (more electron-withdrawing) would increase the value.
   - For **benzaldehyde (Ph-CHO)**, the value would likely be higher than anisole but less than dinitrobenzene (1034.53). A rough guess for benzaldehyde might be ~500-800.
   - **Phenylacetaldehyde (Ph-CH2-CHO)** has an extra -CH2- spacer, which slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde. Thus, the value should be slightly lower than benzaldehyde but still higher than anisole.

### 5. Predicted Property:
   - A reasonable estimate for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **~600-700**.
   - Looking at the examples, **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + hydroxyl) is 817.58, and **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitro) is 1034.53. Phenylacetaldehyde is less electron-withdrawing than these, so a value around **650** seems plausible.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **650.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or computational tools would be needed.)

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1240.3394459862827
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** by analyzing structural features and comparing them to the given data.

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - The presence of a nitro group often correlates with negative property values (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has `-983.05109845`).  
   - However, some nitro-containing molecules (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`) have positive values, suggesting other structural factors dominate.

2. **Heterocycles and conjugated systems**:
   - Molecules with fused heterocycles or conjugated systems (e.g., `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` or `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`) tend to have moderate to high positive or negative values, depending on substituents.

3. **Amides and ureas (N-C=O)**:
   - Amide/urea groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) often lead to negative values.

4. **Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing/donating groups**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NOâ‚‚, Cl) can push values negative, while electron-donating groups (e.g., OMe, OH) can push them positive.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
- **Structure**: The molecule is a fused heterocycle with:
  - Two amide groups (`N-C=O`).
  - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).
  - A conjugated system (aromatic ring linked to the heterocycle).
- **Analogous examples**:
  - `CN(C(=O)N(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two amides, aromatic) has `-1155.88693881`.
  - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (nitro + aromatic) has `-983.05109845`.
  - The presence of two amides and a nitro group suggests a strongly negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of:
1. Two amide groups (strongly negative contribution).
2. A nitro group (negative contribution).
3. Conjugation (may slightly offset negativity).

The predicted property value is likely in the range of **-1000 to -1200**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1100.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to other negative-valued molecules).  

*Note: Without a clear linear trend or quantitative model, this is an educated guess based on the examples.*

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1454.7736866992345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **567.67417333**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) has a property value of **-1071.06451877**.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but instead of a diazo linkage (**N=N**), it has a hydrazine-like linkage (**N-N**). 
   - The diazo compound (**N=N**) is more polar/electron-withdrawing than the **N-N** linkage, which is less polar but still introduces some electron delocalization.

3. **Trends**:
   - The presence of two phenyl rings tends to reduce the property value compared to a single phenyl ring (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1** vs. **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**).
   - The **N-N** linkage is less electron-withdrawing than **N=N**, so we might expect the property value to be less negative than **-1071.06451877** but still lower than **567.67417333** (aniline).

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is likely between the aniline and diazo compound values. A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative but not as extreme as the diazo compound. 

From the examples, a similar molecule with two phenyl rings linked by a less polar group (e.g., **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3**, a terphenyl) has a value of **-1466.19707118**, but this is fully carbon-linked. The **N-N** linkage is less stabilizing than a carbon chain but more than **N=N**.

A plausible prediction is:  
**-733.13498547** (this matches the value of **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34**, another nitrogen-containing polyaromatic system).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**-733.13498547**

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -788.531554424903
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), one of which is part of a cyclic structure (imide-like).
   - A cyclopentane ring (**CCCC1**) fused to the imide.
   - The molecule is a bicyclic system with two carbonyls and two nitrogens, resembling a hydantoin or succinimide derivative.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 614.37413968): This is a similar bicyclic imide with additional alkyl substituents. The presence of the cyclopentane ring (instead of longer alkyl chains) and the symmetry in the target molecule may reduce steric strain or electronic effects.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not explicitly listed, but simpler imides like this tend to have values in the mid-range, e.g., ~600â€“800 based on substituent effects).
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -720.62259282): This is a urea derivative with alkyl groups, showing how substitution can lower the value. The target molecule lacks such substitutions but has a rigid ring system.

3. **Electronic and Steric Effects**:
   - The cyclopentane ring introduces slight strain but is less impactful than larger rings (e.g., cyclohexane in other examples).
   - The symmetric, fused imide structure likely stabilizes the molecule, leading to a moderate positive value.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and lack of destabilizing substituents (e.g., nitro groups, halogens), the property value is likely **positive and in the range of 600â€“800**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 650.0**  
*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, favoring the imide-like structures with moderate rigidity and no extreme electronic effects.)*  

*Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted (e.g., energy, solubility parameter, etc.), this is an empirical guess based on the trend in the data.*

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -263.690645756618
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): **783.21946199**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative): **-472.73448332**
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): **783.21946199** (same as dichlorobenzene, which seems odd; possibly a typo or the property is insensitive to the number of Cl atoms in this case).

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a dichlorinated biphenyl (two phenyl rings connected, with Cl substituents). This is structurally similar to the heavily chlorinated biphenyl example but with fewer Cl atoms.

3. **Trend**:
   - Adding more Cl atoms to aromatic systems seems to decrease the property value (e.g., going from **Clc1ccccc1Cl** to the heavily chlorinated biphenyl drops the value significantly).
   - The target molecule has 3 Cl atoms, which is intermediate between the dichlorobenzene (2 Cl) and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl (many Cl).

4. **Biphenyl Core**:
   - The biphenyl core itself (without Cl) is not in the examples, but the heavily chlorinated biphenyl has a very negative value, suggesting the biphenyl structure contributes to lowering the property.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Dichlorobenzene: **783.21946199**
- Heavily chlorinated biphenyl: **-472.73448332**

The target molecule is a biphenyl with 3 Cl atoms. This is closer to the heavily chlorinated biphenyl but with fewer Cl atoms, so we'd expect a value between these two. 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly positive or near zero, as the biphenyl core lowers the value but the fewer Cl atoms might not push it as negative. 

Looking at the examples, the only other biphenyl-like structure is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic), which has **-1167.92032496**. This suggests biphenyl-like structures tend to have negative values.

Given this, the predicted property for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is likely **negative but less extreme than the heavily chlorinated biphenyl**. 

A plausible estimate: **-200 to -400**. 

From the examples, the closest analog is the heavily chlorinated biphenyl at **-472.73448332**, so we might predict something slightly less negative, say **-400**.

However, the dichlorobenzene is **783.21946199**, and the target is a dichlorobiphenyl, so perhaps the biphenyl core dominates, leading to a value closer to the heavily chlorinated biphenyl. 

Given the uncertainty, a reasonable prediction is: **-472.73448332** (same as the heavily chlorinated biphenyl, since the number of Cl atoms may not linearly affect the property).

But since the target has fewer Cl atoms, let's adjust slightly upward: **-400**.

### Final Prediction:
**-400.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data). 

However, looking back, the heavily chlorinated biphenyl is **-472.73448332**, and the target is similar but with fewer Cl, so perhaps **-400** is reasonable. 

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is: **-472.73448332** (same as the heavily chlorinated biphenyl, as the property may not be sensitive to the number of Cl atoms beyond a certain point). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is:  
**-472.73448332** (same as the structurally most similar example). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., energy, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property seems to correlate strongly with the biphenyl core and Cl substitution.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 141.48457671525685
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to vary widely based on the molecular structure, functional groups, and other features. The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, 1,4-diethylbenzene, given the substitution pattern). 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl substituents tend to have moderate property values (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N** has a value of 783.21946199, while **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** has a value of -1074.00249682).
- The presence of ethyl groups (CC) in the molecule is somewhat similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene), which has a value of -1074.00249682, but with fewer carbons in the substituents.

Given that **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** has two ethyl groups (less bulky than a hexyl group) and no polar or strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups, I would estimate its property value to be **closer to the middle range** of the examples, but leaning toward the lower end due to the lack of polar features. 

A reasonable prediction for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** would be:  
**-500.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted is not explicitly defined (e.g., it could be a computed or experimental value like dipole moment, energy, or another descriptor). The value is chosen to reflect the structural similarity to other alkylbenzenes in the dataset.

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 909.9172343375195
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups Impact**: 
   - Nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., 1707.37, 1183.49, 533.34).
   - Sulfonyl groups (**S(=O)(=O)**) are present in some molecules but not explicitly in the examples. However, sulfonamides (like **S(N)(=O)=O**) are likely to contribute similarly to nitro groups due to their polar nature.
   - Amine groups (**Nc1ccc...**) appear in multiple examples, often with moderate property values (e.g., 533.34 for **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**).

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**) have property values around 567.67.
   - Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro or sulfonyl) tend to have higher values.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a property value of **533.33664893**.
   - The sulfonamide group (**S(N)(=O)=O**) is similarly electron-withdrawing and polar as the nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), so we might expect a comparable or slightly higher value due to the sulfur atom's larger size and polarizability.

4. **Other Sulfur-Containing Examples**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** has a value of 507.20.
   - Sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **P(=S)**) seem to contribute significantly but not as much as nitro groups.

### Prediction for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**:
- The molecule is an aromatic amine with a sulfonamide group, which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
- It is structurally similar to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (value = 533.34), but the sulfonamide group may increase the property slightly more due to sulfur's polarizability.
- Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than 533.34 but not as extreme as nitro-aromatics with multiple nitro groups (e.g., 1707.37).

### Predicted Property Value:
**600.0** (rounded to a plausible value based on the trends). 

This is an educated guess given the limited examples and the absence of a clear mathematical pattern. If more data were available, a more precise prediction could be made.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -778.9945811263387
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It appears to be a **tetracene** derivative (a linear arrangement of four fused benzene rings) or a **phenanthrene**-like structure with additional fused rings. The exact structure is:

```
c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
```

This corresponds to **pyrene**, a well-known PAH with four fused benzene rings in a non-linear, symmetrical arrangement. 

### Comparison to Examples:
Looking at the provided examples, we can observe trends for similar PAHs:
1. `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (property: -699.63878044)  
   - This is a methyl-substituted PAH (likely a methyl-chrysene or similar).  
2. `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property: -1144.7624972)  
   - This is a larger PAH (likely a benzo[a]pyrene or similar).  
3. `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (property: -224.21046033)  
   - This is a methyl-substituted fluorene or similar smaller PAH.  

### Key Observations:
- Larger, more conjugated PAHs tend to have more negative property values.  
- Symmetry and linearity may influence the property, but the exact relationship isn't straightforward.  
- Pyrene (the given molecule) is smaller than benzo[a]pyrene but larger than fluorene.  

### Prediction:
Given that pyrene is intermediate in size between the smaller PAHs (e.g., fluorene-like, property ~ -224) and larger ones (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene-like, property ~ -1144), and considering the provided examples, a reasonable estimate for pyrene would be **between -500 and -800**.  

Looking at the closest structural analog in the examples:  
- `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (methyl-PAH, property: -699.63878044) is somewhat similar in size/conjugation.  

Since pyrene is fully conjugated and symmetrical, its property might be slightly less negative than the methyl-PAH example.  

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`: -650.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples and trends. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property being predicted, which isn't explicitly defined here.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -1347.4776663871985
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, it appears that the property in question could be related to a calculated molecular property such as **molar refractivity**, **polarizability**, or a **quantum chemical descriptor** (e.g., dipole moment, heat of formation, or a DFT-derived energy). However, the values span a wide range (from highly negative to highly positive), suggesting it might not be a straightforward physical property like molecular weight or logP.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Oxygen-rich or polar molecules** (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` with -321.45, `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with -168.05) tend to have negative values.
2. **Aromatic systems** with halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` with -365.38, `Fc1ccccc1` with 567.67) vary widely.
3. **Highly conjugated or complex structures** (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O` with -2062.91) often have large negative values.
4. **Small aliphatic molecules** (e.g., `CCOC(C)OCC` with 374.07, `CC(C)I` with -758.48) show no clear trend.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule to predict is:  
**`Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`**  
This is a **flavonoid-like structure** with:
- Multiple phenolic â€“OH groups (high polarity).
- A conjugated system (benzene + pyrone ring).
- Ether and ketone functionalities.

Given the examples, similar oxygen-rich aromatic systems (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` with 674.49, `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` with -851.55) suggest that such molecules can have **moderate to large negative values** due to their polarity and conjugation.

### Prediction:
The molecule is highly polar and conjugated, resembling examples with negative values. A reasonable estimate would be:  
**`-650.0`**  
*(This is an interpolation based on similar structures in the dataset, accounting for its size and functional groups.)*  

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess. If the property is **heat of formation** or **DFT energy**, the value aligns with complex, stable aromatic systems. If it's **molar refractivity**, the prediction would differ. Clarification on the property would improve accuracy.

   - CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl â†’ 3266.50848442  

2. **Sulfur-containing compounds** also contribute to higher values:
   - Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1 â†’ 1054.19205684  
   - c2ccc1scnc1c2 â†’ 440.68918826  

3. **Amide groups (NC=O)** appear in molecules with moderate to high values:
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1 â†’ 491.62121189  
   - CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 â†’ -212.21924578 (lower due to other factors)  

4. **Smaller fragments or simpler structures** tend to have lower values (e.g., CCCCBr â†’ -1011.62929919).  

### Analysis of **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**:
- Contains **P=O** (phosphoryl group), which is associated with higher values.  
- Contains **S** (thiolate or thioether), which also contributes to higher values.  
- Contains **NC(C)=O** (amide), which may add moderately.  
- The structure is smaller than some of the very high-value examples (e.g., 3266.50848442), but larger than simpler molecules.  

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl â†’ 897.66322287 (similar P=O but with more complex aromatic/Cl substituents).  
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl â†’ 648.08161524 (P=S instead of P=O, but similar complexity).  

Given that **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** lacks the aromatic/Cl substituents but retains P=O and S, I would expect a value **between 600 and 900**.  

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **~750**.  

**Predicted property value: 750.0** (rounded to one decimal place).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -330.0278387899034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure, functional groups, and substituents. The molecule in question is **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene, specifically the trans isomer based on the notation).

From the examples, we can note the following trends:
1. **Chlorine substituents** tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of 58.89, and `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of 853.20).
2. **Simple alkenes** (like `CCCC(=C)C`) have positive values (206.12), but when combined with halogens, the effect can vary.
3. The **trans configuration** (as opposed to cis) may slightly influence the property due to symmetry and dipole moment effects.

Given that `Cl\C=C/Cl` is a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorines, we can infer that its property value would be positive and moderately high, but not as extreme as some of the larger or more complex chlorinated aromatics. 

Looking at similar small chlorinated molecules:
- `CCBr` has a very negative value (-2071.56), but bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine.
- `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of 588.56, but it includes an amine group.
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of 853.20, but it includes a phenol group.

For `Cl\C=C/Cl`, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **200 to 600**. Given its simplicity and symmetry, I predict a value closer to the lower end of this range.

**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: 250.0** (rounded to a plausible value based on the trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, dipole moment, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 526.872574036889
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values vary significantly based on the molecular structure, functional groups, and substituents. The molecule in question is **pyridine (c1ccncc1)**, which is a simple aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1` with a value of 207.69868069) tend to have moderate positive or negative values depending on substituents.
2. **Heterocycles with nitrogen** (e.g., `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` with -92.80009163 or `Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` with 361.8079441) show a range of values, but simple nitrogen-containing rings often have values in the low to moderate range.
3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)** lacks additional substituents or functional groups, which simplifies its contribution to the property.

### Prediction:
Pyridine is a relatively simple, unsubstituted heterocycle. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:
- `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a more complex nitrogen-containing heterocycle) has a value of -92.80009163.
- `CNc1ccccc1` (aniline derivative) has a value of 207.69868069.
- `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (a fused nitrogen heterocycle) has a value of -213.8398114.

Given that pyridine is simpler than these examples and lacks strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups, its property value is likely to be in the low to moderate range. 

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)** is:  
**-50.0** (a modest negative value, reflecting its aromatic nitrogen character but lack of additional functionalization). 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational chemistry tools or a larger training set would be needed.)

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -1595.5022791900174
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of example molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule by identifying structural patterns and functional groups that correlate with the given property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) tend to have positive property values, especially when substituted with electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, I) or polar groups (e.g., NO2, SO2NH2). For example:
   - `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (314.0792927)
   - `Cc1ccccc1Cl` (783.21946199)
   - `Cc1cccc(O)c1` (674.49075948)

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Ethers (`COC`, `OCC`) and esters (`CO(=O)C`) often contribute positively to the property value (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` has 522.14869688).
   - Hydroxyl groups (`OH`) can lead to large positive values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has 2399.48870132) or negative values when combined with other features (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has -393.43403325).

3. **Chlorine Substitution**:
   - Chlorine atoms on aromatic rings often increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has 588.56456125, `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has 1392.78251585).
   - Aliphatic chlorides (e.g., `ClCCCl`) have negative values (-1421.94854587).

4. **Nitrogen-Containing Groups**:
   - Amides (`NC=O`) and nitro groups (`NO2`) can lead to positive values (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has 1183.49412084).
   - Aromatic nitrogens (e.g., in `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2`) contribute positively (142.61583866).

5. **Negative Contributions**:
   - Aliphatic chains (`CCC`, `CCCC`) and simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CC#C`) tend to have negative values (e.g., `CCC` has -2071.55558583, `CC#C` has -470.04028054).
   - Thioethers (e.g., `CSC`) also have negative values (-2071.55558583).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is:  
`OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`

Breaking it down:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - A benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`) substituted with an ester (`CO(=O)`).
   - A fused aromatic system (`c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`) with a chlorine substituent and a nitrogen in the ring (likely a quinoline or similar structure).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO`).
   - An ester (`COC(=O)`).
   - An aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3`).
   - A chlorine substituent on the fused aromatic ring.

3. **Patterns**:
   - The ester and aromatic systems suggest a positive contribution.
   - The hydroxyl groups (especially in an aliphatic context) could contribute a large positive value (as in `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`).
   - The chlorine on the aromatic ring will add a positive contribution.
   - The nitrogen in the aromatic ring (`ccnc`) will also contribute positively.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (two aromatic amides) has -1464.81331697, but this is likely due to the lack of other polar groups.
- `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (multiple Cl and OH on aromatic) has 1392.78251585.
- `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (multiple OH) has 2399.48870132.
- `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (two esters) has 522.14869688.

Given the combination of multiple hydroxyl groups, an ester, an aromatic amine, and a chlorine-substituted fused aromatic system, the property value is likely to be large and positive. The hydroxyl groups alone could push it into the 1000+ range, and the other features would add to this.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for `OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23` to be approximately **1250.0**. 

This is based on:
- The hydroxyl groups contributing ~1000 (similar to `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` but fewer OH groups).
- The ester and aromatic amine adding ~200 (similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC`).
- The chlorine and fused aromatic system adding ~50 (similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` but more complex).

Thus, the final prediction is: **1250.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -729.391178214291
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular properties such as **polar surface area (PSA)**, **logP (partition coefficient)**, or **molecular refractivity**, but the exact nature of the property isn't explicitly stated. However, observing the trends:

1. **Smaller, less polar molecules** (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1` = -205.13, `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1` = -123.85) tend to have lower (often negative) values.
2. **Polar or functionalized molecules** (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Oc1cc(C)nn1c2ccccc2` = -715.36, `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2` = -866.25) have more negative values.
3. **Highly polar or charged groups** (e.g., `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl` = 3266.51) lead to very high positive values.

For the molecule **`CCCCCO` (1-pentanol)**:
- It is a small alcohol with moderate polarity (due to the -OH group) but lacks complex functionalization or aromaticity.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `CCC(C)Cl` (halogenated, less polar) = -348.38  
  - `COC=O` (methyl formate, polar) = -809.71  
  - `CCOC=O` (ethyl formate, slightly less polar) = -610.36  

Given that `CCCCCO` has a single -OH group and a short alkyl chain, its property value should be **moderately negative**, likely between **-500 and -700**.  

**Predicted property value for `CCCCCO`: -600.0** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. For precise predictions, the property being modeled must be explicitly defined.)*

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -831.3852443932119
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of example molecules and their corresponding property values, it's challenging to discern a clear, consistent pattern or a single physical property (such as molecular weight, boiling point, etc.) that aligns with the provided values. The property values range from negative to positive and vary significantly in magnitude, suggesting that the property might be a computed or derived quantity rather than a straightforward physical characteristic.

However, observing some trends:

1. **Aromatic systems** (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) often have property values in the mid-range (e.g., ~500-600).
2. **Polar functional groups** (e.g., `C=O`, `S=O`, `N`, `O`) can significantly influence the value, sometimes increasing or decreasing it.
3. **Halogens** (Cl, Br, I) seem to contribute to higher positive values in some cases (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has 674.49).
4. **Complexity and size**: Larger or more complex molecules (e.g., steroids or polycyclic systems) tend to have very negative values (e.g., `-2062.91` for a steroid-like structure).

### Analyzing the Target Molecule:
`CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1`

This molecule has:
- An aromatic ring (`c2ccccc2`).
- A sulfonyl group (`S(=O)(=O)`).
- A carbonyl group (`C=O`).
- A heterocyclic ring with oxygen (`CCO1`).
- An amide linkage (`Nc2ccccc2`).

Given the presence of the aromatic ring and polar groups like sulfonyl and carbonyl, and comparing to similar examples:
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has a value of 540.87.
- `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has -935.17.
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` has -620.25.

The sulfonyl group might push the value higher (similar to halogens), while the amide and heterocycle could moderate it. The molecule is moderately complex but not as large as the highly negative examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given these observations, a reasonable estimate would be in the **range of 500 to 700**. A plausible specific value could be:

**Predicted property value: 625.0** (rounded to a sensible figure based on the examples). 

This aligns with the influence of the aromatic ring, sulfonyl group, and moderate complexity.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 153.3434330007103
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - Molecules with **NOâ‚‚ (N(=O)=O)** groups tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 533.33664893 for `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` and 1740.96450052 for `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`).
   - **Aromatic rings** with substitutions (e.g., `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2` = 142.61583866) often have moderate positive values.
   - **Ester groups (COO)** can contribute to higher values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` = -709.18420883, but this is a large molecule with other effects).
   - **Methyl groups (C)** and **nitrogen-containing heterocycles** can also influence the property (e.g., `Cc1ccncc1C` = 783.21946199).

2. **This Molecule's Features**:
   - Contains **two ester groups (COO)**.
   - Has an **NOâ‚‚ group** (strong positive contribution).
   - Includes a **substituted aromatic ring** (moderate positive contribution).
   - Has a **nitrogen in a heterocycle (NC=)** (likely positive contribution).
   - The structure is moderately large but not as extended as some of the very high or very low examples.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (361.8079441): Smaller aromatic system, no NOâ‚‚ or esters.
- `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (533.33664893): Aromatic + NOâ‚‚, but no esters or heterocycle.
- `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (14.14742599): Complex heterocycle but lower value due to other effects.
- `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (1740.96450052): Two NOâ‚‚ groups + large substituents (very high value).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- One NOâ‚‚ group (strong + contribution).
- Two ester groups (likely + contribution but not as strong as NOâ‚‚).
- Aromatic + heterocyclic nitrogen (moderate + contribution).
- No strongly negative features (e.g., long aliphatic chains or halogens).

Given these factors, the value should be **higher than 533.33664893** (from `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) but **lower than 1740.96450052** (from the two-NOâ‚‚ example). 

A reasonable estimate is **around 1200-1500**. Looking at the examples, `CCC(C)(C)CC` = 1211.99337845 (but this is aliphatic, so not directly comparable). The presence of the NOâ‚‚ and esters likely pushes it higher.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1450.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted or the model behind the examples, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities.)
==================================================
Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -812.8969105227446
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2` by analyzing structural patterns and their associated property values in the training data.

### Observations from the training data:
1. **Cyclic structures with amide/carbonyl groups (e.g., lactams, imides)**:
   - Molecules with cyclic amides or imides (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` = 432.00343916, `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` = -933.74001164) tend to have moderate to large absolute property values, often negative.
   - The presence of multiple carbonyl/amide groups (e.g., `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` = -713.80491196) further lowers the property value.

2. **Small strained rings (e.g., cyclopropane)**:
   - The molecule contains a cyclopropane ring (`C1(CC1)`), which is a strained system. Strained rings in the training data (e.g., `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2` = -2149.12714827) often correlate with very negative property values.

3. **Imide/dicarbonyl structure**:
   - The molecule is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups (`O=C2NC(=O)...C(=O)N2`). Similar structures (e.g., succinimide-like) in the training data suggest negative property values.

4. **Lack of large aromatic systems or halogens**:
   - The absence of large aromatic systems or halogens (which often increase the property value, e.g., `Clc1cccc(I)c1` = 674.49075948) suggests the property will not be highly positive.

### Prediction:
The molecule `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2` is a cyclic imide with a strained cyclopropane ring. Based on the training examples:
- Cyclic imides with additional strain (e.g., from small rings) tend to have strongly negative property values (e.g., -713.80491196 for `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`).
- The cyclopropane ring further contributes to a more negative value (similar to how strained systems lower the property in other examples).

Given these observations, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **-800 to -1200**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -950.0**  

(Note: This is an approximate prediction based on structural analogies from the provided data. For precise calculations, quantum chemical methods would be required.)
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -2071.5555858337034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including factors such as the presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I), aromatic rings, functional groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N-, -S-), and molecular size/complexity. 

For the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane, or ethyl chloride), we can make the following observations:
1. It contains a single chlorine atom, which in many of the examples tends to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1` has a value of 567.67417333, and `Clc1ccccc1I` has a higher value of 783.21946199 due to the additional iodine).
2. It is a very small, simple molecule with no aromaticity or complex functional groups, which tends to lower the property value compared to larger or more complex molecules (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CC` has a high value of 1211.99337845, but this is likely due to its branched structure and size).
3. Comparing to `CC#N` (acetonitrile, with a value of -470.04028054), which is also a small molecule but with a polar nitrile group, `ClCC` is less polar but has a halogen.

Given these trends, the presence of a single chlorine atom in a small molecule like `ClCC` would likely result in a positive property value, but not as high as larger or more complex halogenated molecules. 

Looking at similar small halogenated molecules:
- `Clc1ccccc1` (chlorobenzene): 567.67417333
- `CC#N` (acetonitrile): -470.04028054
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (a complex steroid): -1950.27021466

Since `ClCC` is simpler than chlorobenzene but has a chlorine like chlorobenzene, its value should be lower than 567.67417333 but still positive. 

A reasonable estimate for `ClCC` would be around **300 to 500**. Given the examples, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for ClCC: 450.0** 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples, as no exact pattern or formula is given. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property being modeled.)
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 640.7346554397681
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen (Cl, Br, I) substitutions. The property tends to be more negative for highly halogenated or complex structures (e.g., ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...) and more positive for simpler or less halogenated structures (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC).

The molecule in question is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which contains:
- A chlorinated pyridine ring (Clc1ccccn1).
- A trichloromethyl group (C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) attached to the pyridine.

Comparing this to similar structures in the examples:
1. **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** has a property of **-344.62371263**. This is a dichlorinated biphenyl structure, less halogenated than our molecule.
2. **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...** has a property of **-1068.96569356**, which is more negative due to additional complexity and halogenation.
3. **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a property of **-472.73448332**, which is somewhat similar to our molecule but with an additional phenyl ring.

Our molecule has a pyridine ring (more polar than benzene) and a CCl3 group, which is highly electronegative. This suggests the property will be negative but not as extreme as heavily perchlorinated structures (e.g., **-1226.00332345** for ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...)).

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** would be between **-400 and -600**. A precise prediction based on the examples is challenging without a clear trend, but a plausible value is:

**Predicted property value: -512.34567890**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For accurate predictions, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model or computational chemistry tools would be necessary.)

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -84.70018262600972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**: 
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol) has a property value of **374.07101493**.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol) has a property value of **238.39346359**.
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) has a property value of **207.19331282**.
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-hexanol) has a property value of **512.241773**.

2. **Trends**:
   - The property value for alcohols seems to depend on the carbon chain length and branching. 
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have higher values (e.g., 3-heptanol > 3-hexanol > 2-methyl-1-pentanol).
   - Branching may slightly reduce the value (compare 3-hexanol vs. 2-methyl-1-pentanol).

3. **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol):
   - This is a 6-carbon alcohol with branching at the second carbon (similar to 2-methyl-1-pentanol but with a longer linear chain).
   - It is structurally similar to **CCC(CC)CO** (3-hexanol, value = 512.241773) but with the hydroxyl group at the second carbon instead of the third.
   - Branching at the second carbon may slightly reduce the value compared to 3-hexanol.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCC(CC)CO** (3-hexanol, value = 512.241773) and the slight reduction due to branching, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol) would be slightly lower, around **~400-450**.

However, comparing it to **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol, value = 374.07101493), which has a longer chain but no branching, and **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol, value = 207.19331282), which has more branching, I would interpolate a value closer to **~350-400**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O: 380.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar alcohols in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the given data.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 588.5645612506096
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of halogens (Cl, Br), aromatic rings, functional groups, and molecular size. The property values range widely, from highly negative to highly positive, with no immediately obvious linear trend. However, we can attempt to predict the property for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Observations:
1. **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-426.8523072**.
2. **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a biphenyl with two Cl substituents) has a property value of **-426.8523072** (same as dichlorobenzene, which seems coincidental or possibly a duplicate entry).
3. **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (dibromobenzene) is structurally analogous to dichlorobenzene but with bromine instead of chlorine. Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may influence the property.

### Prediction Approach:
- Since **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-426.8523072**, and bromine is heavier/more polarizable than chlorine, we might expect a slightly more negative or less negative value due to electronic effects.
- However, the dataset does not show a clear trend for halogens (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl** has **-758.4780452**, while **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** has **514.51203187**, which is counterintuitive).
- Given the lack of a clear trend, a reasonable guess for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** would be close to the dichlorobenzene value but adjusted slightly for the bromine effect.

### Predicted Property:
A plausible prediction for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-400.0** (rounded estimate, considering the uncertainty in the trend). 

However, if we assume the property is similar to the dichlorobenzene case (since the dataset shows identical values for two different dichlorobenzene-like structures), the prediction could also be **-426.8523072**. 

Given the ambiguity, I will lean toward a slight adjustment due to bromine's effects and predict:  
**Predicted property value: -410.0**  

*(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more examples, this is an approximate estimate.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 101.39052188669314
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, particularly with the presence of halogens (Cl, Br), aromatic systems, and functional groups. The property appears to be sensitive to the number of chlorine atoms and the degree of aromatic substitution.

Let's analyze the given molecule:
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with the following features:
1. Two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl system).
2. Each ring is heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (5 chlorines on one ring and 4 on the other, totaling 9 chlorines).
3. The substitution pattern is highly symmetrical.

Comparing this to the provided examples:
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a hexachlorobenzene-like structure with 12 chlorines) has a property value of **578.03126562**.
- The given molecule has fewer chlorines (9 vs. 12) but a similar biphenyl backbone. 

Given the trend, the property value for the given molecule should be somewhat lower than 578.03126562 due to fewer chlorines but still significant due to the aromatic and polychlorinated nature. 

A reasonable prediction, interpolating from the examples, would be around **450.0**. 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the property seems to scale nonlinearly with the number of chlorines and the complexity of the aromatic system. The given molecule is less chlorinated but still highly conjugated, so a value closer to **500.0** might be more appropriate. 

After reconsidering the examples, a more precise estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 520.0** (rounded to reasonable precision based on the trends). 

### Final answer:  
**520.0**

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -1518.4577309780689
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse range of property values in the provided examples, predicting the exact value for the new molecule requires identifying structural and functional group patterns that correlate with the property. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Key Structural Features of the New Molecule**:
   - Aromatic rings (`c1ccc...cc1`, `c2cccc(C)c2`, `c3ccccc3C`).
   - Phosphate ester group (`OP(=O)(...)O...`).
   - Methyl substituents (`Cc1...`, `C)c2`, `cc3C`).
   - The molecule is relatively large and polar due to the phosphate group and multiple aromatic systems.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with phosphate groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`) have property values of **-863.338** and **2003.421**, respectively. This suggests phosphate-containing molecules can span a wide range, but the presence of aromatic systems and polar groups tends to push values toward the middle or negative range.
   - Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` at **-1862.858**) often have negative values, but simpler aromatics like `CC(C)c1ccccc1` have positive values (**238.393**).
   - The new molecule is more complex than most examples, resembling a mix of aromaticity and phosphate polarity.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The phosphate group and multiple aromatic rings suggest a moderately negative value, but the methyl substituents and lack of highly electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, F) may temper this. 
   - A reasonable estimate is between **-500 and -1000**, leaning toward the middle of this range due to the balance of aromaticity and polarity.

**Predicted Property Value**: **-750.0**  
*(This is an educated guess based on structural analogies; for precise values, computational or experimental methods would be required.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -789.8603973850887
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogens, nitro groups, and other substituents. The molecule in question is:

**FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**

Breaking this down:
1. It contains a **trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**, which is highly electronegative and often contributes to higher property values (e.g., see molecules with CF3 in the examples).
2. An **aromatic ring** with a **nitrogen-containing heterocycle (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)** attached. The heterocycle includes two chlorine atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O), which are polar and likely increase the property value.
3. The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) and a carbonyl group suggests significant polarity and molecular weight, which often correlate with higher property values in the examples (e.g., Cl-heavy molecules like `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` have high values).

Comparing to similar structures:
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **659.73820092** (nitro group + Cl + aromatic).
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **533.33664893** (nitro group + aromatic amine).
- `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` has a value of **967.18061113** (CF3 + sulfonamide + carbonyl).

This molecule has **CF3 + aromatic + carbonyl + two Cl atoms + heterocycle**, which is more complex than most examples. Given the additive effects of these groups, I predict a **high positive value**, likely in the range of **800â€“1200**.

### Predicted property value: **1024.57382921** (estimated based on combined contributions of CF3, Cl, carbonyl, and aromatic/heterocyclic features). 

This is an educated interpolation from the examples, as no exact match exists. The value reflects the molecule's polarity, halogenation, and functional group density.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 757.2881673792356
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = 538.56227499 (two nitro groups)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Property = -1356.40294671 (no nitro group, but complex structure)
   - **c1ccccc1O**: Property = 567.67417333 (phenol, no nitro group)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = 538.56227499 (two nitro groups)
   - The nitro group seems to contribute positively but not overwhelmingly to the property value.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC**: Property = 819.29394146 (two ester groups with methoxy)
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is similar but has one nitro group instead of esters.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1**: Property = 674.49075948 (methyl-substituted benzene)
   - **c1ccccc1O**: Property = 567.67417333 (phenol)
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has both methoxy and nitro groups, which are electron-withdrawing and donating, respectively.

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, while the methoxy group is electron-donating. This combination might lead to a moderate property value.
   - Comparing to **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (538.56 with two nitro groups), **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one nitro and one methoxy, so the value might be slightly higher due to the methoxy group's contribution.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely to be in the range of **500-700**. A reasonable estimate, considering the contributions of the methoxy and nitro groups, is:

**Predicted property value: 602.453** (approximate, based on similar structures in the dataset). 

This is a rough interpolation based on the given examples, as no clear linear or simple trend is immediately apparent. The actual value could vary slightly depending on finer structural effects not captured in the examples.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: -871.3974753367544
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, halogen substitution (especially Cl and Br), and structural features like rings and branching. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a complex polycyclic structure, which likely contributes to a high property value due to the additive effects of multiple chlorine atoms and ring strain.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Highly chlorinated molecules** in the examples tend to have high positive values (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` has a value of **71.15593782**, and `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of **1392.78251585**).
2. The molecule `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` has **8 chlorine atoms** and a **caged polycyclic structure**, which is even more complex than the examples provided.
3. The presence of multiple chlorines on a strained ring system (like a cubane-like framework) would likely increase the property value significantly compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics or aliphatics.
4. Comparing to the highest-value examples (e.g., `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` at **2253.71038558**, which is a phosphate ester, and `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` at **1392.78251585**), this molecule's extreme chlorination and rigidity suggest a value in a similar or higher range.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` is:

**1780.25000000** (estimated based on additive effects of chlorination and structural complexity). 

This is a rough interpolation, but it aligns with the trend of highly chlorinated, polycyclic structures having very high positive values in the given dataset.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -445.5776058356753
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Contributions**:
   - **Ethers (e.g., C-O-C)**: Often contribute negatively to the property value (e.g., `C1CCCCCC1` vs. `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...`).
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group (especially in esters, aldehydes, or ketones) tends to increase the property value (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` has a high value of 410.34).
   - **Alkyl Chains**: Longer alkyl chains tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `CCC#C` is -550.71, while `CCCCC#C` is -340.17).
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: Esters (like `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` with a value of 58.78) show moderate positive values.

2. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (ethyl ester with an aromatic ring) has a value of **58.78**.
   - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` (more complex ester) has a value of **-1873.30**, but this is likely due to the large aromatic system and additional functional groups.
   - `CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (complex ketone/amide) has a value of **-1359.00**, again due to size and aromaticity.

3. **Simple Esters**:
   - `CCCOC=O` is a simple ester (propyl formate) with no aromaticity or additional functional groups. Its property value should be closer to simpler esters like `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (58.78) but likely lower due to the absence of an aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The ester group (`COC=O`) contributes positively.
- The propyl chain (`CCC`) is small and not highly polar, so it won't drastically reduce the value.
- No aromaticity or other functional groups are present to complicate the prediction.

A reasonable estimate for **CCCOC=O** is slightly lower than `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (58.78) but still positive. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCOC=O: ~40.0**  
*(This is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., heat of formation, dipole moment, etc.â€”this is a best-effort estimate based on the provided data trends.)*

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 555.0536589860437
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to follow certain trends based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC`  
This is a fatty acid ester with a long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) and an ethoxy group (`OCC`) attached to the carbonyl carbon. 

From the examples, we can observe:
1. Long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` with property `-1074.00249682` or `CCCCC(CC)C=O` with `898.31449369`) tend to have large-magnitude property values, either positive or negative.
2. Esters or carbonyl-containing compounds (e.g., `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` with `1097.05413127` or `CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C` with `-1431.36280599`) also show large-magnitude values.
3. The presence of oxygen atoms (e.g., in `OCC(O)C(O)CO` with `1082.81966639`) can contribute to positive values.

Given that this molecule has:
- A long hydrocarbon chain (`CCCCCCCCC`),
- An ester group (`C(=O)OCC`), and
- No strongly electronegative substituents (like halogens or nitro groups), which in the examples often lead to negative values,

I predict the property value will be a large positive number, similar to other long-chain or ester-containing molecules in the dataset. 

**Predicted property value:** `1200.0` (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical pattern or model, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities to the provided examples.)

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -853.1258443252334
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and conjugation. The molecule in question is:

**Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Two benzene rings (highly conjugated).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Hydroxyl (-OH), 
   - Chloro (-Cl), 
   - Amide (-C(=O)N-), 
   - Nitro (-N(=O)=O).
3. **Polarity and conjugation**: Strong electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, NOâ‚‚) and electron-donating groups (OH) create significant polarity and conjugation.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = 659.73820092): This has a nitro group and chloro substitution on a benzene ring.
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 301.73211804): This has a hydroxyl and chloro substitution on a benzene ring.
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = 491.62121189): This has an amide group attached to a benzene ring.

The given molecule combines all these features (OH, Cl, amide, NOâ‚‚, and two aromatic rings), suggesting additive or synergistic effects. The presence of the nitro group and the extended conjugation (amide linker between two substituted rings) will likely increase the property value compared to simpler analogues.

### Predicted property:
Given the complexity and the combined effects of the substituents, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** is:

**-780.4365964**  

(This is based on the closest structural analogue in the examples, **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which has similar substitution patterns and a property value of -780.4365964. The nitro group and amide linker in the new molecule may slightly alter the value, but this is a reasonable estimate given the data.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -1355.0273437183598
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of example molecules and their corresponding property values, it's clear that the property in question is influenced by molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogens (especially chlorine), and heteroatoms like sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. 

The molecule to predict is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Generally increases the property value when present in high quantities (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` has a high value of 997.96, while `ClC=C` has a very negative value, likely due to simplicity).
2. **Sulfur (S)**: Tends to decrease the property value (e.g., `CCSSCC` has -729.39, `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` has 410.34).
3. **Phosphorus (P)**: The presence of P(=S) groups (as in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) gives a moderate positive value (226.68), but this is confounded by other groups.
4. **Aromatic rings**: Increase the property value (e.g., `c1ccccc1` has 526.87).
5. **Oxygen (O)**: Can either increase or decrease the property depending on context (e.g., `CCO` has -1421.95, while `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has 659.74).

### Analysis of the target molecule:
- The molecule is symmetric with two `P(=S)(OC)` groups linked via a thioether (`S`) bridge between two aromatic rings.
- It has:
  - Two aromatic rings (increases property).
  - Two `P(=S)(OC)` groups (likely moderate positive contribution, similar to the example with P(=S) giving 226.68).
  - A sulfur bridge (`S`) which may decrease the property.
  - No chlorine (which tends to increase the property significantly).

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and the presence of `P(=S)(OC)` groups, the property value is likely moderately positive but not extremely high (due to lack of Cl). Comparing to similar structures:
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of 226.68, but our molecule lacks Cl and has an extra `P(=S)(OC)` group and aromaticity.
- The sulfur bridge may offset some of the increase from the `P(=S)(OC)` groups.

### Estimated value:
A reasonable prediction is **~300 to 500**. Given the examples, I'll lean toward the higher end due to the two `P(=S)(OC)` groups and aromaticity, but the sulfur bridge pulls it down slightly. 

**Final predicted property value: 450.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 659.7382009197082
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with specific functional groups and structural features in the molecules. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`  
This is **2-nitrophenol**, which contains:
1. A phenol group (`Oc1ccccc1`).
2. A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to the aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can find similar molecules with these functional groups:
1. `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (a hydroxybenzamide) has a property value of **817.58608825**.
2. `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (a nitrotoluene) has a property value of **817.58608825**.
3. `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` (a halogenated benzene) has a property value of **674.49075948**.
4. `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (a chloroaniline) has a property value of **674.49075948**.

The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) and hydroxyl group (`OH`) on the aromatic ring seem to contribute significantly to the property value. Notably, the presence of both groups in `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` suggests a value similar to the nitrotoluene (`Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) and hydroxybenzamide (`NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`), both of which have **817.58608825**.

Thus, the predicted property value for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is:

**817.58608825**

True Property: -1963.6440466059612
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule **OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**, which is a highly oxygenated carbohydrate (likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide derivative), and analyzing the provided examples, we can infer the following trends:

1. **Oxygen-rich molecules** (e.g., sugars, polyols) tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `-393.43403325`).
2. **Size and branching**: Larger molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (like this one) typically exhibit more negative values due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding.
3. **Comparison to similar structures**: The given molecule resembles a branched sugar with multiple `C(O)C(O)` segments, similar to smaller sugars in the dataset but scaled up in complexity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the extensive oxygenation and size, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O** would likely be **strongly negative**, in the range of larger oxygenated molecules in the dataset. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**\-1200 to \-1500** (closer to the more negative values like `-1854.31460887` for a steroid with multiple OH groups, but adjusted for the lack of rings in this case).

### Final Prediction:
**\-1350.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to highly oxygenated examples).

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -550.7069021279681
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as functional groups, conjugation, aromaticity, halogens, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **CCC#C** (1-butyne), which is a simple linear alkyne with no additional functional groups or complex structural features.

From the examples:
- **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone) has a property value of **206.123427**.
- **CCCCCC=O** (an aldehyde) has a property value of **-311.80370893**.
- **CCCC(O)CCC** (an alcohol) has a property value of **374.07101493**.
- **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (a long-chain alcohol) has a property value of **200.43105915**.

Alkynes are less polar than alcohols or carbonyls but more polar than alkanes. Given the simplicity of **CCC#C** and its lack of strong polar functional groups, its property value is likely modest and positive, similar to small hydrocarbons or weakly polar molecules in the dataset.

**Predicted property value for CCC#C: ~150.0**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend of simpler hydrocarbons and alkynes in the given examples.)*  

*(Note: The exact property is unclear without knowing its nature, but it likely falls in the lower-mid range of the given examples.)*

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 561.7289047388601
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will attempt to predict the property value for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` by identifying patterns and similarities with the training data.

### Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Group**: The molecule contains a `P(=S)` group, which appears in some of the training examples. For instance:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a property value of **226.67713353**.
   - `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has a property value of **3963.18768423** (this is much higher, likely due to the larger size and additional functional groups).

2. **Aromatic Chlorine Substituents**: The molecule has a chlorinated phenyl ring (`c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`), similar to:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with a value of **58.89441397**.
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` with a value of **-344.62371263**.
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` with a value of **997.96074504** (this is an outlier, possibly due to symmetry or fewer Cl substitutions).

3. **Ethoxy Group (`CCO`)**: The molecule has an ethoxy group attached to the phosphorus, similar to the methoxy group in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`.

4. **Overall Structure**: The molecule is a phosphorothioate ester with a chlorinated phenyl ring and an ethoxy group. This is somewhat similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` but with an ethoxy instead of a methoxy and no amide side chain.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (value = 226.67713353), but with a slightly simpler structure (no amide side chain), I would expect the property value to be somewhat lower but still positive. The presence of multiple chlorines on the phenyl ring may also contribute to a higher value (as seen in `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = 997.96074504, but this is an extreme case).

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` would be around **150.0**.

However, looking more closely at the training data, the phosphorothioate with a chlorinated phenyl ring (`COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) has a value of 226.67713353, and removing the amide side chain might reduce this by ~50-100, leading to a value closer to **100-150**.

### Final Prediction:
**120.0** (This is an educated guess based on the trends in the data, but without a clear quantitative model, the exact value is uncertain.) 

(Note: If this is a specific property like "dipole moment" or "heat of formation," the prediction might vary. The examples suggest the property could be related to molecular energy or a similar computed property, but the exact nature isn't specified.)

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 246.74541662299234
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` by identifying patterns and trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the data:
1. **Aromatic systems with heteroatoms (N, O, S)** tend to have higher (positive) property values when they contain electronegative atoms or polar functional groups. For example:
   - `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (783.21946199)
   - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (361.8079441)
   - `Sc1ccccc1` (567.67417333)

2. **Non-aromatic or aliphatic systems** tend to have lower (negative) property values, especially if they are hydrocarbons or contain halogens (Cl, Br, F) without strong polar groups. For example:
   - `C=C` (-1373.94319906)
   - `CC(C)C` (-758.4780452)
   - `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (1555.58830161) is an exception due to the high number of electronegative Cl atoms.

3. **Polar functional groups** like `C=O`, `N=O`, or `S=O` can significantly increase the property value if they are part of conjugated or aromatic systems. For example:
   - `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (573.07596227)
   - `C=CCS(=O)SCC=C` (1016.46395985)

4. **Conjugated systems** (e.g., fused aromatic rings or extended Ï€-systems) tend to have moderate to high values, especially if they include heteroatoms. For example:
   - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (-213.8398114)
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (-748.28857161)

### Analysis of the target molecule: `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`
1. The molecule is a **pyridine derivative** (`c1nccc...c1`) with a **hydrazide group** (`C(=O)NN`) attached. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with nitrogen, which typically contributes to higher property values.
2. The `C(=O)NN` group is highly polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which likely increases the property value.
3. The molecule is small but contains both aromaticity and a polar functional group, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` with a value of 573.07596227).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (361.8079441): Aromatic with nitrogen and fused rings.
- `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (573.07596227): Aromatic with multiple nitrogens and a carbonyl group.
- `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (357.72195281): Aromatic with nitrogens and polar substituents.

The target molecule is less complex than `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` but more polar than `Nc1cccc2ccccc12`. The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is very polar, so I expect the value to be higher than 361.8079441 but likely less than 573.07596227.

### Predicted value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` to be approximately **450.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples and trends. The actual value may vary depending on the specific property being measured.)

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -421.9529427198055
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups (P=O or P=S)**:
   - Molecules with **P=O** or **P=S** groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) tend to have moderate positive property values (e.g., **507.1981559**).
   - The presence of **P=S** seems to contribute positively but not extremely high.

2. **Thioester or Thiol Groups (-S-)**:
   - Molecules with **-S-** (e.g., **CCS**) have very negative values (e.g., **-2071.55558583**), but this is likely due to small/barebones structures rather than the sulfur alone.
   - Thioesters (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**) can lead to highly negative values (e.g., **-1371.29913944**).

3. **Amide Groups (-C(=O)N-)**:
   - Amides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) can lead to high positive values (e.g., **1764.74763284**), especially in cyclic or branched structures.
   - The cyclic amide (lactam) in **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** may contribute positively.

4. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Long alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**) tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., **-366.39592192**), but this is not a strict rule.

5. **Combined Functional Groups**:
   - When multiple functional groups are present, their contributions are not strictly additive but depend on interactions. For example:
     - **P=S** + **-S-** + **-C(=O)N-** could lead to a balance between positive (amide) and negative (thioether) contributions.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** has:
- A **P=S** group (moderate positive contribution).
- A **thioether (-S-)** linker (likely negative contribution).
- A **cyclic amide (lactam)** (strong positive contribution).
- Alkyl chains (neutral to slightly negative).

Given the competing effects:
- The **P=S** and **cyclic amide** will push the value toward the positive side.
- The **thioether** and alkyl chains may moderate this.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (P=S + nitro groups) has a value of **507.1981559**.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (cyclic amide) has a value of **1764.74763284**.
- **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (thioester) has a value of **-1371.29913944**.

The target molecule is a hybrid of these, with both **P=S** and **cyclic amide** outweighing the **thioether**. Thus, the value should be positive but not as high as pure amides.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is:  
**~ 800.0** (moderate positive, similar to phosphorus-containing amides).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 800.0** (approximate, based on structural analogies).
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -366.39592191884475
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to correlate with the size and complexity of the molecule, as well as the presence of functional groups, halogens, or other substituents. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or substituents, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a property value of `-366.39592192`. The presence of the hydroxyl group (`O`) likely contributes to this negative value.
2. `CCCC/C=C/C` (a hexene) has a property value of `-63.98192049`. The double bond introduces some complexity but no highly electronegative atoms.
3. `CCC(C)C` (isobutane) is not in the dataset, but simpler alkanes like `CC(C)CCO` (isobutanol) have negative values (`-181.72332305`), while `CC(C)(C)CO` (tert-butanol) has a positive value (`847.14078162`), suggesting that branching or functional groups can significantly influence the property.

Since `CCCCCCCC` is a simple, unsubstituted alkane, we would expect its property value to be less negative than `CCCCCCCO` (due to the lack of a polar hydroxyl group) but more negative than `CCCC/C=C/C` (due to the lack of a double bond, which might introduce some electronic effects). 

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of `CCCCCCCC` would be slightly more negative than `CCCC/C=C/C` but less negative than `CCCCCCCO`. 

**Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: `-200.0`** (This is an approximate estimate based on the trend in the data.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, solubility, etc.â€”this is a rough interpolation. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -1939.6071075795464
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correspond to some form of calculated molecular property, possibly related to energy (e.g., heat of formation, electronic energy, or other quantum-chemical properties). The values are highly specific and likely come from computational chemistry calculations (e.g., DFT or other methods).

For the molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

This is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, a ketone group (=O), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and an alkyne (C#C). Comparing it to similar molecules in the examples:

1. **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** has a property value of **-1966.33311823**.  
   This is very similar to the given molecule but lacks the alkyne and has a slightly different ring structure.

2. **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** has a value of **-1682.46103467**.  
   This is also a steroid-like molecule with additional functional groups.

3. **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **-1948.78239719**.  
   This is another close analog with ketone and hydroxyl groups.

The given molecule has an alkyne group (C#C), which may slightly increase the energy (make the property value less negative) compared to the fully saturated analogs. However, the presence of the ketone and hydroxyl groups will contribute significantly to the stabilization (more negative values).

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the similarities to the examples above, a reasonable estimate for:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**  
would be:  
**-1850.0** (interpolated based on the closest examples).  

This is an educated guess based on the trend observed in the provided data for structurally similar molecules. For a precise value, actual computational chemistry calculations would be required.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2669.849052628284
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the diverse range of property values in the provided examples, predicting the exact property value requires careful consideration of structural features and their contributions. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCHâ‚ƒ) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: From the examples, these groups tend to contribute positively to the property (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = 783.22, `COc1ccccc1Cl` = 539.27).
2. **Ether linkages (OCHâ‚‚) and cyclic ethers (e.g., furan-like rings)**: These are present in examples like `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` (440.69) and contribute moderately.
3. **Lactone or cyclic ester (COC2=O)**: Similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1` (120.72) but more complex.
4. **Multiple fused rings and sugar-like moieties (e.g., OC4OC3COC...)**: These are not directly represented in the examples, but fused aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`) have large negative values (-1330.95), while sugar-like fragments are absent in the training set.
5. **Overall size and polarity**: The molecule is large and highly oxygenated, which may balance contributions from polar groups (positive) and size/complexity (negative).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest examples in complexity are large polycyclic systems (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` = -2647.25) and highly substituted aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` = -79.35).
- The presence of multiple methoxy/OH groups may offset some negative contributions from size, but the fused rings and cyclic ethers likely dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the size and mixed contributions, the property value is expected to be **negative and large in magnitude**, similar to other polycyclic systems in the examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1420.5**  
*(This is an interpolation based on the range of values for similar structural motifs in the training set.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 783.2194619854209
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular weight, polarity, and structural complexity, though the exact nature of the property isn't explicitly defined (e.g., boiling point, solubility, etc.). 

Let's analyze the given molecule: **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Phenol derivatives** (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` with property value 659.73820092 and `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` with 817.58608825) tend to have property values in the range of ~600â€“800.
2. **Chlorinated aromatics** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1I` with 783.21946199 and `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 199.26668753) show variability, but simpler mono-/di-chlorinated aromatics are in the higher range (~700â€“800).
3. The presence of both **OH and Cl** on the benzene ring (as in `Oc1ccccc1Cl`) is similar to `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property 817.58608825) but with Cl instead of NO2. Chlorine is less polar than NO2, so the value might be slightly lower.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`: 817.58608825  
- `Clc1ccccc1I`: 783.21946199  
- `Fc1ccccc1`: 567.67417333  

Given that `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is less polar than `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` but more polar than `Fc1ccccc1`, and chlorine is heavier than fluorine but lighter than iodine, a reasonable estimate would be between 700â€“800, closer to `Clc1ccccc1I` (783.21946199).

### Predicted property value for `Oc1ccccc1Cl`:  
**~750.00000000** (approximating based on the trend).  

However, looking more closely, `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` is 817.58608825, and replacing NO2 with Cl (less polar but similar mass) might reduce the value slightly. Thus, a more precise estimate would be slightly lower than 783.21946199 (the value for `Clc1ccccc1I`), since iodine is heavier than chlorine.  

Given these adjustments, a refined prediction is:  
**~760.00000000**.  

But to match the precision of the examples, let's round to:  
**763.42158900**.  

### Final answer:  
The predicted property value for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is **763.42158900**.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -620.6312614147375
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` in the examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (similar to `NC(=O)` in examples like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1`).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly present in examples, but triple bonds are less common in the dataset).
   - **Chlorinated alkyl chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` or `ClC1C(Cl)...` in examples).
   - **Ester-like fragment**: `CCOC(=O)` (similar to `COC(=O)` in `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC`).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule has polar groups (amide, Cl substituents) and aromaticity, which often correlate with negative property values in the dataset.
   - The size is moderate (not as large as steroids or polycyclic systems in the dataset, which have very negative values).

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (property: -165.076) has an amide and ether linkage, similar to our molecule, but ours has more Cl substituents and an alkyne.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (property: 185.281) is highly chlorinated but has a very different structure.
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property: -789.860) has a highly electronegative CF3 group and Cl substituents, leading to a very negative value. Our molecule is less extreme but still has two Cl atoms and polar groups.

4. **Alkyne Contribution**:
   - The alkyne (`C#C`) is rare in the dataset, but it is a relatively nonpolar feature. Its presence might slightly reduce the magnitude of the property compared to similar molecules without it.

### Estimated Property:
Given the above, the molecule has:
- Two Cl atoms (contributing to a negative value, but not as extreme as perchlorinated examples).
- An amide group (similar to examples with values around -100 to -500).
- An alkyne (slightly offsetting the polarity).
- Aromaticity (contributing to stability but not drastically changing the property).

A reasonable estimate is between **-200 and -400**. Looking at similar examples like `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (-165.076) and adjusting for the additional Cl and alkyne, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -312.45** (a balanced estimate considering the structural features). 

This is an educated guess based on the dataset's trends, where polar/electronegative substituents (Cl, amide) tend to decrease the property value, while nonpolar features (alkyne) may partially offset this.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -851.5510347043211
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** by analyzing structural features and trends in the data.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - A hydroxyl group (**OH**) attached to a central carbon.
     - Two aromatic rings (one with a **Cl** substituent: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, and another with a **Cl** substituent: **c3ccccc3Cl**).
     - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**), which is a heterocycle with nitrogen atoms.
   - The presence of multiple **Cl** atoms and aromatic systems suggests moderate to high polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions (e.g., dipole-dipole, van der Waals).

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Cl** substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**, **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) tend to have property values in the range of **-472 to 674**.
   - Molecules with heterocycles (e.g., **Nc1nc[nH]n1**, **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2**) have values ranging from **201 to 621**.
   - The presence of multiple aromatic rings and **Cl** substituents suggests a value closer to the middle of these ranges.

3. **Central Carbon with Multiple Aromatic Groups**:
   - Similar to **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = **-1067.00754538**), which has two aromatic rings attached to a central nitrogen, our molecule has three aromatic systems attached to a central carbon. However, the **OH** group and **Cl** substituents will influence the value differently.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is larger and more polar than simple aromatic systems, likely leading to a more negative property value (as seen with larger, polar molecules in the examples).

### Prediction:
Considering the above, the property value for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** is likely in the range of **-800 to -1200**. A reasonable estimate, based on the closest structural analogs, is:

**Predicted property value: -1050.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., energy, solubility parameter, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value could be refined with more specific information about the property or additional similar molecules.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -311.80370893473463
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary significantly based on the molecular structure, functional groups, and overall complexity of the molecule. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate). Let's analyze its features:
1. It is a relatively small molecule with an ester functional group (**OC=O**).
2. It has a linear alkyl chain (**CCCC**) attached to the ester oxygen.
3. Compared to similar molecules in the examples:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a property value of **631.74476946**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (methyl acetoacetate) is not directly comparable, but esters with longer chains or additional functional groups tend to have higher or lower values depending on substitutions.
   - Simpler esters or aldehydes (e.g., **CCCCCC=O**, hexanal) have negative values (e.g., **-311.80370893**), but this is an aldehyde, not an ester.

Given that **CCCCOC=O** is a simple ester with no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups, and considering the value for **CCCC(=O)OCC** (631.74476946), we can infer that the property for **CCCCOC=O** would be in a similar range but slightly lower due to its smaller size and lack of an additional ethyl group.

### Predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O**:  
**~500.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., molecular polarizability, boiling point, or another descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)  

For higher precision, the exact property being modeled would need to be clarified, but this aligns with the observed pattern in the examples.  

**Final answer: ~500.0** (likely between 400 and 600 based on the examples).  

(If you can specify the property, a more accurate prediction could be made.)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2071.5555858337034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value for molecules with simple halogenated structures tends to be highly negative when the halogens (like Cl or Br) are present in small, symmetric molecules. 

For instance:
- `ClCCCl` has a property value of `-1421.94854587`
- `CCBr` has a property value of `-2071.55558583` (same as `CNN`, which suggests this might be a placeholder or error, but the trend for small halogenated molecules is clear)
- `CCCC` (butane) also has the same value as `ClCCCl` (`-1421.94854587`), which seems inconsistent, but the trend for small molecules with halogens is toward large negative values.

The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is even simpler than `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane) and is symmetric with two chlorines attached to a single carbon. Given the trend for small halogenated molecules, we can predict that its property value will be highly negative, similar to `ClCCCl` but possibly more extreme due to the smaller size and higher symmetry. 

A reasonable prediction for `ClCCl` would be close to `ClCCCl` but slightly more negative. Given the examples, a plausible value is:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: `-1500.0`** 

(Note: This is an estimate based on the observed trend, as the exact pattern isn't perfectly clear from the limited examples. If more data were available, a more precise prediction could be made.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 997.9607450438149
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
1. The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (cresol derivative) with:
   - A methyl group (**C**) at position 1 (or adjacent to the hydroxyl group, depending on numbering).
   - Another methyl group (**C**) on the benzene ring.
   - A hydroxyl group (**O**) attached to the benzene ring.

2. Key features:
   - Aromatic ring (benzene).
   - Two methyl substituents (electron-donating groups).
   - One hydroxyl group (strongly polar and hydrogen-bonding).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = **674.49075948**  
  This has two hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring, and the property is positive and relatively large.
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (dimethylphenol): Property = **703.11575324**  
  This is very similar to the target molecule but with an additional branched methyl group. The property is also positive and large.
- **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (alkyl-substituted dihydroxybenzene): Property = **-567.05788243**  
  This has two hydroxyl groups and a long alkyl chain, but the property is negative, likely due to the long hydrophobic tail.
- **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): Property = **659.73820092**  
  This has a hydroxyl and a nitro group (electron-withdrawing), and the property is positive but slightly lower than catechol.

### Observations:
1. **Phenol derivatives with hydroxyl + alkyl groups** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 674.49 for catechol, 703.12 for dimethylphenol).
2. The presence of **methyl groups** (electron-donating) seems to **increase the property value** slightly compared to just hydroxyl groups.
3. The target molecule (**Cc1cccc(C)c1O**) is structurally closest to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = 703.11575324), but with slightly less branching.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (703.11575324) but with a simpler methyl substitution pattern, I expect the property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** to be **slightly lower but still in the same range**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property = ~650.0**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- Catechol (two -OH): 674.49  
- Dimethylphenol (two -CH3, one -OH): 703.12  
- Target (one -CH3, one -OH, one -CH3): Likely between 650 and 700.

Given the symmetry and substitution, I'll predict:  
**Predicted property = 680.0**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is **680.0**.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -189.37688705175222
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` by comparing its structure to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. The molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) derivative with multiple chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings. 
2. Similar molecules in the dataset with multiple chlorine substitutions (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`) have property values of **137.916088** and **185.28078933**, respectively. 
3. The molecule `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine substitutions than the second example (which has 7 Cl atoms, while this one has 6 Cl atoms). 

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- More chlorine substitutions tend to increase the property value (compare 137.916088 for 5 Cl vs. 185.28078933 for 7 Cl).
- The molecule in question has 6 Cl atoms, so its value should lie between these two.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the first example but lower than the second. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**~160.0** (approximate interpolation based on the trend). 

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- The first example (`Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`) has 5 Cl atoms and a value of 137.916088.
- The second example (`Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`) has 7 Cl atoms and a value of 185.28078933.
- The difference per additional Cl is roughly (185.28 - 137.92)/2 = ~23.68 per Cl.

For 6 Cl atoms, we'd expect:  
137.916088 + 23.68 â‰ˆ **161.6**.

### Final Prediction:
**161.6** (rounded to one decimal place). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 799.0642724746111
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including factors such as the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, branching, and molecular weight. 

The molecule in question is **CC=C(C)C** (2-methyl-2-butene), which is a simple branched alkene with no aromatic rings or polar functional groups. 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a property value of **-36.16825383**.
- **CCCCCCCC** (octane) has a property value of **-366.39592192**.
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a property value of **1060.45216641**.

Given that **CC=C(C)C** is a smaller and less complex molecule than the examples above but has some branching (like **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**), we can infer that its property value might fall in a moderate range. 

Considering the trends:
- Alkenes with no branching (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**) have relatively small absolute values.
- Branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) have larger positive values.
- The presence of a double bond (as in **CC=C(C)C**) may reduce the magnitude compared to fully saturated branched alkanes.

A reasonable prediction for **CC=C(C)C** would be a positive value, but smaller than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**, perhaps in the range of **500â€“800**. 

**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: ~650.0** (This is an estimate based on the observed trends in the given data.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, solubility, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the provided examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2071.5555858337034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure, including factors such as the presence of halogens (Cl, F), aromatic rings, functional groups (OH, CO, NO2, etc.), and molecular size/complexity.

For the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), which is a simple, small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon, we can compare it to similar small halogenated molecules in the dataset:

1. **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of **1811.72664751**.
2. **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **196.79340331**.
3. **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a complex polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-871.39747534**.

Dichloromethane (ClCCl) is simpler than these examples, with only two chlorine atoms and no aromaticity or additional functional groups. Smaller halogenated molecules in the dataset tend to have positive property values, but not as high as heavily chlorinated ones like tetrachloroethylene. 

Given this, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** would be in the range of **500â€“1000**, leaning toward the lower end due to its simplicity. 

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: ~650.0** (This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, polarizability, etc.â€”this is a rough interpolation from the given examples.)

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1177.2439286707686
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of halogens (Cl, Br), aromatic rings, functional groups (e.g., -OH, -CO, -NO2, -SO2), and molecular size/complexity. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**  
This is a trichlorophenol derivative (specifically, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) with the following features:
1. Aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents (electron-withdrawing, heavy atoms).
2. A hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the aromatic ring (electron-donating, polar).
3. High halogen content (three Cl atoms), which tends to increase the property value in the examples (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of 1117.13836037, which is very similar structurally).

### Prediction:
The property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is likely very close to the provided example of **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (1117.13836037), as the only difference is the position of one chlorine (meta vs. para substitution), which may not drastically alter the property. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**~1117.13836037** (likely slightly higher or lower by a small margin due to minor positional effects).  

For specificity, I will predict:  
**1115.0** (rounded slightly for simplicity, given the nearly identical structure to the example). 

However, since the exact example is almost identical, the most precise answer is:  
**1117.13836037** (same as the nearly identical example). 

### Final answer:  
**1117.13836037** (same as the closely related example in the dataset).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2669.849052628284
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the diverse range of property values in the provided examples, predicting the exact property value requires careful consideration of structural features and their apparent influence on the property. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Oxygen-rich functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, carbonyls)** tend to reduce the property value (e.g., sugars like `OCC1OC(...)C1O` have large negative values).
2. **Aromatic systems** with simple substituents (e.g., `Sc1ccccc1`) have moderately positive values.
3. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I, F)** can increase or decrease the value depending on context (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has a high positive value, while `ClCC` is very negative).
4. **Large aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC...`) have small positive values.
5. **Complex polycyclic systems** (e.g., steroids, fused rings) tend to have large negative values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is highly oxygenated with multiple ethers (`OC`), alcohols (`O`), a carbonyl (`C=O`), and a furan-like system (`OCOc5cc67`). It also contains a complex polycyclic structure resembling a glycoside or terpene derivative. 

Structural breakdown:
- **Oxygen-rich regions**: `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`, `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`, `OCOc5cc67`.
- **Polycyclic core**: `C6C2C(COC2=O)C(...)c7cc5OCOc5cc67` suggests fused rings with oxygen substituents.
- No halogens or large aliphatic chains.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are oxygen-rich polycyclic molecules like:
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = `-1155.61188309`).
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = `-1877.50122877`).
- The target molecule is even more oxygenated and complex than these, suggesting a more negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the high oxygen content and polycyclic complexity, the property value is likely **more negative than the sugar-like examples**, but not as extreme as some steroids. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: `-1980.0`**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing negativity with oxygen and ring complexity.)*  

### Note:
Without a clear quantitative model, this prediction is approximate. The actual value could range between `-1500` to `-2500` based on the examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1281.6697907869325
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (`S` and `N`), similar to thiazole or imidazole derivatives in the examples. 
   - Example: `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a property value of **-815.64947045**. This molecule also has a 5-membered ring with `N` and `S` and a `C(C)(C)C` group.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - A thiocarbonyl (`C=S`) or thioether (`C-S-C`) group (from `S` in the ring).
   - A carbonyl (`C=O`) group.
   - A tertiary butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`), which appears in other molecules with known properties (e.g., `-815.64947045` for the above example).
   - An amide-like (`N-C=O`) or urea-like (`N-C(=O)-N`) fragment.
3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property: **-815.64947045**) shares the `C(C)(C)C` group and a 5-membered ring with `N` and `S`.
   - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property: **1165.72323488**) has a similar 5-membered ring with `N` and `C=O` but lacks the `S` and `C(C)(C)C` group.
   - `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (property: **-321.4519497**) has a 5-membered ring with `S` and `C=O` but lacks the `C(C)(C)C` group.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is most similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property: **-815.64947045**), as both have:
- A 5-membered ring with `N` and `S`.
- A `C(C)(C)C` group.
- A carbonyl (`C=O`) group.

However, the presence of the `S` in the ring and the additional `N` in the ring may slightly modify the property. Given the similarity, the property value should be close to **-815.64947045**, but likely less negative due to the simpler structure (no additional `O` or `N` outside the ring).

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is approximately **-500.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarity to the given examples.)

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -56.66275602925446
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is ethyl benzoate, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`),
- An ester group (`C(=O)O`),
- An ethyl group (`CCO`).

From the examples, we can compare similar structures:
1. `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butanoate) has a property value of **643.42458947**.
2. `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` (a more complex ester with additional substituents) has a value of **1097.05413127**.
3. `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (a cyclic amide/imide) has a value of **727.97511412**.
4. `CCCC(=O)CC` (a ketone) has a value of **531.7966918**.

Ethyl benzoate is simpler than the second example but more complex than the first and fourth. The benzene ring likely contributes a significant positive value (e.g., `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` has **314.0792927**, and `Nc1ccccc1` has **567.67417333**). The ester group also adds to the value, as seen in the first example.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` would be between **600 and 800**, closer to the ethyl butanoate value but higher due to the aromatic ring.

**Predicted property value:**  
**~700.0** (e.g., **700.0 Â± 50** as a rough estimate based on the trend).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, solubility, etc.â€”this is an empirical guess based on the given data.)  

**Final answer:**  
**700.0** (approximate).  

(If you have more context about the property, the prediction could be refined further.)

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -366.39592191884475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Cl-containing molecules):**
   - **CI** has a very negative value (-3274.75897215), likely due to the high polarity and small size of the molecule.
   - Other Cl-containing molecules vary widely, but longer carbon chains with Cl tend to have less extreme values (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: -365.38025434).

2. **Bromine-Containing Molecules:**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of 201.64530593.
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (a brominated heterocycle) has a much higher value (1532.55910267), likely due to additional functional groups.

3. **Hydrocarbon Chains:**
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (octene) has a negative value (-202.48357194).
   - **CCCCCCCO** (octanol) has a negative value (-366.39592192), suggesting that longer chains with polar groups can reduce the property value.

4. **Trend for Alkyl Bromides:**
   - The only pure alkyl bromide in the data is **CI**, which is not directly comparable. However, comparing **CCCCCCCO** (octanol, -366.39592192) and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene, 201.64530593), we see that Br adds positive contribution relative to OH in this context.
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear alkyl bromide, similar to octanol but with Br instead of OH. Br is less polar than OH but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- The molecule is a 7-carbon chain with a terminal Br, similar in structure to **CCCCCCCO** (octanol) but with Br instead of OH.
- Br is less polar than OH but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon, so the property value should be between that of **CCCCCCCC=C** (-202.48357194) and **CCCCCCCO** (-366.39592192), but likely closer to zero due to Br's intermediate polarity.
- Given that **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) is 201.64530593, a linear alkyl bromide might have a slightly lower value due to less conjugation.

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCBr** is **-100.0** (interpolating between the trends for similar molecules). However, looking at the data more closely, the closest analog is **CCCCCCCO** (-366.39592192), and replacing O with Br might increase the value by ~200-300 (since Br is less polar but still contributes positively compared to pure hydrocarbons). Thus, a better estimate is **~-150 to -50**.

Given the examples, I will predict:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -120.0**  

(Note: This is an approximate interpolation based on the limited examples. For higher accuracy, more data or a model would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -3274.7589721483005
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight. Simple molecules with fewer atoms and less complexity tend to have lower (often negative) property values, while more complex or highly functionalized molecules (e.g., nitro groups, multiple rings, halogens) tend to have higher (often positive) values.

The molecule in question is **CO (carbon monoxide)**, which is a very small and simple diatomic molecule. Comparing it to other small molecules in the dataset:
- **CCC (propane)**: -2071.55558583  
- **CC#C (propyne)**: -470.04028054  
- **CCBr (bromomethane)**: -2071.55558583  

CO is even simpler than these, with only two atoms and no branching or heavy atoms (like Br). However, it does have a polar triple bond, which might slightly increase its property value compared to nonpolar small molecules like propane.  

Given this, a reasonable prediction for **CO** would be a negative value, but less negative than propane due to its polar nature. A plausible estimate is:  

**Predicted property value for CO: ~ -1500.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., energy, solubility, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the trend in the provided data.)  

Would you like to clarify the property being predicted (e.g., is it molecular energy, logP, etc.)? That could refine the estimate.
