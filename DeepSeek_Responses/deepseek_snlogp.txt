Iteration: 1
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.25557195236706853
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify some trends in the property values:

1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CC(C)C`, `CCCCCC`) tend to have high positive values (~0.95 to 0.96).
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2`) also tend to have positive values, especially if substituted with polar groups.

2. **Oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, carbonyls, esters)**:
   - Alcohols (e.g., `CCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)COC(=O)C`) tend to have negative values (~-1.0 to -0.9).
   - Esters (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC`) have less negative or near-zero values (-0.016 for `CCOC(=O)CC`).
   - Carbonyls (e.g., `C=CC=O`) have moderately negative values (~-0.8).

3. **Halogenated compounds**:
   - Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Br)c1`) tend to have negative values (~-0.89), while heavily chlorinated aliphatics (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`) have positive values (~0.44).

4. **Long-chain esters**:
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is a long-chain ester (decyl acetate analog). Similar examples include:
     - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (no exact match, but `CCCCCC(=O)OC` is not provided).
     - `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is not in the list, but `CCCCCC(=O)OC` is not provided either.
     - The closest is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (decanoate ester), which is not directly listed, but shorter esters like `CCOC(=O)CC` have a value of -0.016.

Given the trends:
- Long-chain esters seem to have values closer to zero or slightly negative. For example:
  - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl butanoate): -0.016
  - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (longer chain) might have a slightly more negative value due to increased hydrophobicity.

However, another similar example is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (not in the list), but `CCCCCC(=O)OC` is not provided. Given that `CCOC(=O)CC` is -0.016 and longer chains might trend more negative, I would predict a value around **-0.6 to -0.7**.

But looking at `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`), another close example is `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (not provided), but `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is not listed. 

Given the lack of exact matches, I will interpolate:
- `CCOC(=O)CC`: -0.016 (short ester)
- `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (long ester): likely more negative due to increased chain length. 

A reasonable guess is **-0.63103855** (same as `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the list, which is actually present as `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` with value -0.63103855). 

Wait, reviewing the examples again, I see:
`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is explicitly listed with value **-0.63103855**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is:  
**-0.63103855** (same as the provided example). 

However, the molecule you asked to predict is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, which is identical to one of the examples (`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` with value -0.63103855). 

Therefore, the predicted value is:  
**-0.63103855**. 

(Note: If this was a typo and you meant a different molecule, please clarify. Otherwise, the value is directly from the examples.) 

Final answer: **-0.63103855**.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.6232492109120059
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic System with Heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a fused bicyclic system with a benzene ring (6-membered) and a 5-membered ring containing oxygen (O) and nitrogen (NH) with a carbonyl (C=O) group. This is similar to heterocyclic aromatic systems like **c1cncnc1** (property: -0.20373036) or **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.60795689), but with additional complexity.
2. **Chlorine Substituent**: The presence of a chlorine atom on the benzene ring is seen in many examples, such as **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property: -0.33056791) or **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: -0.93853797). Chlorine tends to lower the property value (more negative).
3. **Lactam-like Structure**: The 5-membered ring with NH and C=O resembles a lactam (cyclic amide), which is seen in molecules like **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: -0.861962). Such groups often contribute to negative property values.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.60795689), which also has a 5-membered ring with C=O and NH but with sulfur instead of oxygen. The replacement of sulfur with oxygen (more electronegative) and the addition of a chlorine substituent would likely make the property more negative.
- Another similar molecule is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: -0.861962), which has two amide groups in a 6-membered ring. Our molecule has one amide in a 5-membered ring, so the value should be less negative than this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.72**  

This balances the effects of the aromatic system, the electronegative chlorine, and the lactam-like structure.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8764344639668528
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or nitroso groups (**N=O**) tend to have moderate to low property values, often negative or near zero. For example:
     - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a property value of **-0.3546332**.
     - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a property value of **-0.61757239**.
   - However, some nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine-like structures) can have higher values (e.g., `Nc1nccs1` has **0.95887625**).

2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple oxygen atoms (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls) often have lower or negative property values, especially if polar or acidic (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1` has **0.93692953**, but this is an exception due to aromatic stabilization).

3. **Alkyl groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCl`) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.86060617**), but branched alkanes (e.g., `CCC(C)CC`) can have positive values (**0.61382628**).

4. **Polarity and electronegativity**:
   - Highly polar or electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, F, Br) often reduce the property value, especially in aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has **0.42418091**, but `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has **-0.93853797**).

### Analysis of **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
- This molecule has:
  - A branched alkyl group (**CC(C)**), which could slightly increase the property value.
  - A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is highly polar and likely reduces the property value.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (with a nitro group) has **-0.3546332**.
  - `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` (with polar amide/nitro-like groups) has **0.44279333**.
  - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has **0.3030691**.

Given the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature and the branched alkyl group's modest positive contribution, the property value is likely **moderately negative or near zero**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.25** (approximate, considering the balance between the nitro group's negative contribution and the branched alkyl's slight positive effect).  

However, looking more closely at the example `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-0.3546332), which has a nitro group and alkyl/ether substituents, our molecule is simpler (just a branched alkyl nitro), so the value might be slightly less negative.  

**Final prediction: -0.20** (range: -0.3 to -0.1).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.20**.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.7450523719893234
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is a steroid derivative with multiple rings, hydroxyl (-OH), and carbonyl (C=O) groups, which introduce polarity but are balanced by the hydrophobic hydrocarbon framework.

Breaking it down:
1. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Increases polarity (tends to decrease the property value, as seen in simpler alcohols like `CCO` or `CC(C)CCCO` with negative values).
2. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: Polar but less so than -OH; its effect depends on context (e.g., `CC(=O)C(C)(C)C` has a high positive value, while `CCCC(=O)CCC` is negative).
3. **Steroid backbone**: Large hydrophobic structure with fused rings (similar to `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`, which has a value of **-0.5947597**). This reduces polarity overall.
4. **Additional polar groups**: The presence of both -OH and C=O in a rigid framework may partially cancel out their individual effects.

**Comparison to similar molecules**:
- The steroid-like structure with carbonyls (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`) has a value of **-0.5947597**.
- Molecules with mixed polar/nonpolar features (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`) have negative values (**-0.73397861**).
- The additional -OH and -CH2OH here may slightly raise the value compared to pure ketones but not enough to go positive.

**Prediction**: The property value is likely **negative but closer to zero** than simpler ketones due to the size and balancing polar groups. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.6**, aligning with similar steroid derivatives.

**Final answer**: **-0.55** (approximate, based on structural analogs).

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.765328117607724
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). From the examples:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) often have property values in the range of **-1.0 to +1.0**, depending on other functional groups.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **-0.99291022**, while `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has **0.95897867**.

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide groups (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`). From the examples:
   - Amide-containing molecules like `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` have a value of **-0.82921927**.
   - The presence of amides tends to lower the property value (more negative).

3. **Halogen Substituents**:
   - Fluorine substituents (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`): Example `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has **0.55687267**.
   - Chlorine substituent (`c2ccc(Cl)cc2`): Example `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **-0.99291022**.

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The amide groups likely dominate, pulling the value toward the negative range.
   - The aromatic rings with halogens may moderate this effect slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of the amide groups and the moderately negative contribution from the halogenated aromatics, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.8**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65** (similar to molecules like `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` but slightly less negative due to the aromatic halogens).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.65**
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.35529381082667993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ethers and Oxygen-Containing Aliphatic Chains**:
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate): Property = -0.01639249
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): Property = -0.81995363
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol): Property = -0.32793851
   - **CCCO** (1-butanol): Property = -1.00870538
   - **CCCCO** (1-pentanol): Property = -1.00870538 (same as above, likely a typo)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol): Property = 0.46439896

   Ethers and alcohols with simple aliphatic chains tend to have property values in the range of **-1.0 to 0.5**, with most being slightly negative.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)C**) tends to increase the property value (e.g., 0.95223646 for this highly branched hydrocarbon).
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol) has a positive value (0.46439896), likely due to branching.

3. **CCCOC(C)C (isopropyl propyl ether)**:
   - This is a branched ether with a propyl group and an isopropyl group.
   - Compared to **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate, -0.01639249), this lacks the carbonyl group, which might slightly increase the property.
   - The branching (isopropyl) could push the value higher, similar to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (0.46439896).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Simple ethers/alcohols are slightly negative.
- Branching increases the value.
- No strongly polar or aromatic groups are present to significantly alter the value.

A reasonable estimate for **CCCOC(C)C** would be slightly positive due to branching but not as high as highly branched hydrocarbons. 

**Predicted property value: 0.15** (approximate, likely in the range of 0.1 to 0.3).

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical guess based on the given examples. The value is likely closer to small positive numbers for branched aliphatic ethers. If more context were provided (e.g., the property is logP), the prediction could be refined further.

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.8430052995426728
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is present in some of the examples (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` with a property value of **0.41709061**).
   - It has a **lactam-like structure** (cyclic amide with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 3 of the ring), similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (property value: **-0.73397861**) but with additional substitutions.
   - The presence of **alkyl groups (CCC(C))** may increase hydrophobicity, similar to `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (property value: **0.78024874**).

2. **Polarity and Halogen Effects**:
   - The **bromine atom** introduces moderate polarity and bulkiness. In the examples, bromine-containing molecules tend to have mid-range values (e.g., **0.41709061** for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`).
   - The **carbonyl groups (C=O)** and **NH** in the ring increase polarity, which may lower the property value (as seen in lactam-like structures with negative values).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule resembles a mix of `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (Br-substituted, value: **0.417**) and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (lactam-like, value: **-0.734**).
   - The alkyl group (CCC(C)) may offset some of the polarity, pushing the value toward the positive side but not as high as purely hydrophobic molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the polar (Br, C=O, NH) and nonpolar (alkyl) groups, the property value is likely in the **low-to-mid positive range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.25**  

This reflects the competing effects of the bromine (slightly positive contribution) and the polar lactam-like core (slightly negative contribution), with the alkyl group nudging it toward the positive side.

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.575924153128989
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular properties such as **logP (partition coefficient)** or **aromaticity/planarity**, but the exact property isn't explicitly named. However, observing the trends:

1. **Highly aromatic systems** (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.107).  
2. **Simple aromatic systems** (e.g., biphenyl-like structures) or molecules with moderate polarity tend to have **values around 0.5–0.9**.  
3. **Non-aromatic or aliphatic systems** (e.g., `CCCCCCC`) have **strongly negative values** (e.g., -0.96).  

The molecule in question, **biphenyl (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`)**, is a simple aromatic system with two connected benzene rings. Based on similar examples:  
- `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (large aromatic system) = -0.107  
- `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (aromatic + aliphatic) = 0.959  
- `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (aromatic with small aliphatic substitution) = 0.938  

Biphenyl is less aromatic than large fused systems but more aromatic than aliphatics. A reasonable estimate would be **close to 0.9**, similar to other aromatic systems with minor substitutions.  

**Predicted property value: ~0.92**  

*(Note: If this is logP, biphenyl’s experimental logP is ~3.98, but the scale here seems normalized or transformed. The value is inferred from structural analogs in the given data.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.8605498505664837
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Functional Group Analysis**: The molecule contains a thiol group (-SH) at the end of a 4-carbon chain. Thiols are polar but less polar than alcohols, and the alkyl chain is hydrophobic. 

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (a branched alkene) has a value of **0.12906062**.
   - **CC(C)I** (a branched alkyl halide) has a value of **0.30227594**.
   - **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (an ester with an aromatic amine) has a value of **0.26501708**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **-0.26240277**.

   Thiols are somewhat intermediate in polarity between alkanes and alcohols/halides, but the presence of sulfur (which is less electronegative than oxygen) suggests a lower polarity contribution than alcohols.

3. **Chain Length**: The 4-carbon chain is relatively short, so the hydrophobic effect is not as dominant as in longer chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**).

4. **Prediction**: Given the above, the property value for **CCCCS** is likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**, closer to the aliphatic halide/ester examples but slightly lower due to the weaker polarity of the thiol group.

### Final Predicted Property Value: **0.18** (estimated based on trends in the dataset). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted is not explicitly defined (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), but it aligns with the observed trends for similar structures.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.4549804963547578
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Branching and Size**: 
   - Highly branched alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., **0.61382628** for **CCC(C)(C)C** and **0.95223646** for **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**).
   - Linear alkanes or less branched molecules (e.g., **CCCC/C=C/C**) have moderate positive values (e.g., **0.27287625**).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH) groups**: 
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** has a value of **-0.47220656**, suggesting that -OH can reduce the property value, especially in branched alkanes.
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** has a value of **-0.08009214**, which is less negative, possibly due to less branching or positioning of -OH.
   - **Other polar groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2, COOH)**: Generally reduce the property value unless combined with aromatic systems or other features.

3. **Combination of Branching and -OH**:
   - The molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched alkane with a terminal -OH group. 
   - Comparing to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = **-0.47220656**), the -OH is internal in the latter, which may have a stronger reducing effect on the property. 
   - In **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, the -OH is terminal, which might lessen the reduction effect compared to an internal -OH.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (less branching, -OH) = **-0.08009214**.
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (more branching, internal -OH) = **-0.47220656**.
   - **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is intermediate in branching and has a terminal -OH, so its value should lie between these two.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched alkane with a terminal -OH, so its property value should be slightly negative but less so than **CCCC(C)(O)CC**. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.2** and **-0.4**. 

Averaging the effects of branching (positive contribution) and -OH (negative contribution), I predict:  
**Property value = -0.35**

### Final Answer:
**-0.35**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.7023528277181303
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **methyl-dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene** (simplified: a methyl-substituted fused bicyclic aromatic system). It consists of:
- A methyl group (`C`) attached to a fused bicyclic aromatic system (`c1ccc2ccccc2c1`), which is essentially two benzene rings fused in a linear fashion (like naphthalene but with a methyl group).

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **c1ccccc1 (benzene)**: Property = 0.92945818  
   - Pure aromatic ring, high value.

2. **Cc1cccc(C)c1C (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene)**: Property = 0.91680757  
   - Methyl groups on aromatic ring, slightly lower than benzene but still high.

3. **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (methyl-substituted naphthalene)**: Property = 0.93876132  
   - Very similar to our target molecule (methyl + fused bicyclic aromatic), high value.

4. **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like)**: Property = 0.72057224  
   - Larger fused aromatic system, lower than naphthalene-like structures.

### Key Observations:
- Methyl groups on aromatic systems tend to slightly reduce the property compared to pure aromatic systems (e.g., benzene vs. toluene).
- Fused bicyclic aromatics (naphthalene-like) have high values (~0.93-0.94).
- Larger fused systems (anthracene-like) have lower values (~0.72).

Our molecule is **methyl-substituted naphthalene-like**, so it should be very close to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (0.93876132)** but slightly lower due to the methyl group.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (0.93876132)**, I predict a value of **~0.93**. Rounding to match the precision of the examples, I suggest:

**Predicted property for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1: 0.935**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on structural similarity. The exact value would require computational or experimental validation.)

To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic structure with two amide (N-C=O) groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.63870641**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with **C(C)CCC** (a branched alkyl chain) and **CC=C** (an alkenyl group). 
   - Compared to the example molecule (which has **CC=C** and a methyl group), this molecule has a longer/bulkier alkyl substituent (**C(C)CCC**).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of the **hydantoin core** suggests the property value should be in the **positive range** (similar to the example with 0.63870641).
- The **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** is less polar than smaller substituents, which might slightly **increase** the property value (as seen with other alkylated molecules like **CC(C)C** with 0.95654324).
- The **CC=C** group is retained from the example, which already contributes positively.

### Adjusting for Substituents:
- The example with **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has a value of **0.63870641**.
- Adding a **bulkier alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** would likely **increase** the property value slightly (as bulkier alkyl groups tend to increase hydrophobicity/nonpolarity, correlating with higher values in the examples).

### Predicted Value:
Given the similarity to the example but with a more nonpolar substituent, the predicted property value would be **slightly higher** than **0.63870641**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.72**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be needed.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.5568726659560259
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the property being predicted is likely related to **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Trends in the data**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCCC`) have negative values, becoming more negative with longer chains (e.g., `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` is -1.01), which contradicts typical logP trends (alkanes are hydrophobic with positive logP). This suggests the property might be **negative logP** or a transformed version.
   - Aromatic rings with polar groups (e.g., `COc1ccccc1O`) have less negative values, while halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`) are very negative.
   - Highly fluorinated or chlorinated compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have positive values, suggesting halogens increase the property.

2. **Key observations**:
   - `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (trifluoromethylbenzene) is a fluorinated aromatic compound. Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative but also lipophilic, so they often increase logP.
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has a value of -0.330, but `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (more chlorines) jumps to 0.674. This suggests heavy halogenation increases the property.
     - `Cc1ccccc1CC` (alkylbenzene) is -0.119, while `Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1` (more alkylated) is 0.938.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The trifluoromethyl group (`CF3`) is strongly lipophilic. Given that:
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (-0.330) has fewer halogens than `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (3 fluorines), but fluorines are less lipophilic than chlorines.
     - `Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1` (0.938) has bulky alkyl groups, somewhat analogous to `CF3`.
   - A reasonable estimate is **between 0.5 and 0.7**.

**Final predicted value**: **0.62** (interpolating between fluorinated and alkylated aromatic examples).

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.36539138305628227
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = **-0.32793851**) tend to have negative property values, likely due to high polarity/hydrogen bonding.
- The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has even more hydroxyl groups (6 OH groups) and a cyclic structure, which may further enhance its polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.

Comparing this to similar polyols in the dataset:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (linear, 6 OH): **-0.32793851**
- **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (cyclic, 5 OH): Likely more negative due to constrained geometry and high H-bonding potential.

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** would be more negative than **-0.32793851**, likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This aligns with the trend that highly polar, polyhydroxy compounds exhibit increasingly negative values for this property.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -1.0117722133734794
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure (e.g., **CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**), similar to some of the examples (e.g., **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**, which has a property value of **0.56180987**). Steroid-like structures with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls) tend to have intermediate to high positive values in the given dataset.

2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Two carbonyl groups (**C=O**) in the side chain (**CC(=O)OCC(=O)**).
   - Two hydroxyl groups (**C3(O)** and **C(O)**) on the steroid core.
   - These polar groups increase hydrophilicity, which may lower the property value compared to purely hydrophobic steroids.

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property: **-1.00648709**): This has a similar steroid core with a carbonyl and ester group, but lacks hydroxyls. Its value is very negative.
   - **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **0.56180987**): This has a hydroxyl and carbonyl but no ester. Its value is positive.
   - The given molecule has both hydroxyls and ester/carbonyl groups, so its value may lie between these two.

4. **Side chain**: The **CC(=O)OCC(=O)** side chain is polar and flexible, likely reducing the property value compared to simpler steroid cores.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the steroid core (which tends to increase the property value) and the polar groups (which tend to decrease it), the predicted property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- The hydroxylated steroid core contributing ~0.5–0.6 (similar to **CC1(O)CCC2...**).
- The polar side chain reducing the value by ~0.1–0.2. 

Thus, **0.45** is a plausible intermediate value.

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -1.016166884827531
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, halogens, etc.). The property values range from approximately -1.0 to +1.0, with more negative values often associated with highly polar or halogenated aromatic systems and more positive values with less polar or aliphatic systems.

The molecule to predict is:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Steroid-like framework**: The molecule has a fused polycyclic structure resembling steroids (e.g., cholestane or similar), with a rigid, hydrophobic core.
2. **Functional groups**:  
   - One **carbonyl (C=O)** group (polar, but embedded in a hydrophobic environment).  
   - One **hydroxyl (OH)** group (polar, but likely on a less accessible carbon due to the rigid structure).  
3. **Overall polarity**: The molecule is predominantly hydrophobic due to its polycyclic aliphatic structure, with limited polarity from the C=O and OH groups.  

### Comparison with Examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = 0.63303522): This is a steroid-like molecule with two hydroxyl groups and aromaticity, yet the property is positive (~0.63).  
- **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (property = -0.71587992): A long aliphatic chain with an ester, but the property is negative. This suggests that the property is not purely hydrophobicity-driven.  
- **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is more similar to the first example but lacks aromaticity and has fewer polar groups.  

### Prediction:
Given the steroid-like framework with only one C=O and one OH, the molecule is likely **moderately polar but dominated by hydrophobic character**. The property value should be **positive but not extremely high**, similar to the other steroid-like example (0.633).  

However, since this molecule has fewer polar groups and no aromaticity, the value might be slightly lower.  

### Final Prediction:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.55**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the examples. If the property is, for example, logP or a solubility-related metric, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7494922401219438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
     - Example with acetamide-like group: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 0.18161832). This suggests a moderate positive contribution.
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O). 
     - Examples with nitro groups:
       - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (property = 0.88946945)
       - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = 0.90944458)
       - `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` (property = 0.30302308)
     - Nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value, especially when not sterically hindered.
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro) and electron-donating (NH from acetamide) may create a push-pull effect, but the nitro group's influence is stronger.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = 0.90944458): This has a nitro group and a methoxy (electron-donating) group on the aromatic ring. The property is highly positive.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 0.18161832): This has an acetamide-like group but no nitro group, leading to a lower value.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (property = 0.88946945): Nitrobenzene, which is very similar but lacks the acetamide group.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has:
- A nitro group (strongly increasing the property, similar to nitrobenzene's ~0.89).
- An acetamide group (moderate positive contribution, but less than a nitro group).
- The acetamide's NH may slightly reduce the nitro group's effect compared to `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (0.909), but the nitro group's dominance suggests a value close to nitrobenzene.

Given these observations, the predicted property value is likely slightly lower than nitrobenzene but still strongly positive. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.75** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that nitro groups increase the property and acetamide groups have a smaller effect.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.3678868990709387
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a relatively polar and bulky group. Similar sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CSSC**, **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 0.947812, 0.95897867). The presence of sulfur often correlates with higher values.
2. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**, **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**) often correspond to positive property values (e.g., 0.95897867, 0.42418091).
3. **Lactam-like heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2)**: This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group. Similar groups (e.g., **c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)**, **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC**) can have either positive or negative values depending on the rest of the structure.
4. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not strongly predictive on their own.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines features from **sulfur-containing compounds** (high positive values) and **chlorinated aromatics** (moderate to high positive values), but also includes polar heterocycles (which can lower the value). 
- The closest analogs are likely **Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.95897867)** and **CSSC (0.947812)**, but the additional complexity (heterocycle, ethoxy groups) may slightly reduce the value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong influence of the **P(=S)** and **Cl** groups, the property value is likely in the **high positive range**, similar to other sulfur/chlorine-containing molecules in the dataset. However, the polar heterocycle may temper this slightly. 

**Predicted value: 0.85**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trends observed in the examples, likely between 0.8 and 0.95.)*

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.44544822203458384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., -OH, -CO)**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups like **-OH** or **-CO** tend to have negative property values, especially if they are not heavily substituted with halogens or other electronegative atoms. For example:
     - `CC(C)CO` has a property value of **0.74872808** (positive, but note this is a secondary alcohol).
     - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **-0.32793851** (highly polar, negative).
     - `CCCC(O)CCC` has a value of **-0.47220656** (alcohol, negative).
   - However, tertiary alcohols or bulky alcohols may behave differently due to steric effects or reduced polarity.

2. **Tertiary alcohols vs. primary/secondary alcohols**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a **tertiary alcohol** (the carbon bearing the -OH group is bonded to three other carbons). 
   - From the examples, `CC(C)CO` (secondary alcohol) has a positive value (**0.74872808**), while `CCCC(O)CCC` (primary alcohol) has a negative value (**-0.47220656**). 
   - Tertiary alcohols are less polar than primary/secondary alcohols due to steric hindrance, which may push the property value toward the positive side.

3. **Branching and sterics**:
   - Highly branched molecules (e.g., `CC(C)(C)CO`) often have less exposure of polar groups, reducing their negative contribution to the property. 
   - Compare with `CCC` (propane), which has a slightly negative value (**-0.05978795**), but branching or adding polar groups can shift this.

4. **Similar structures**:
   - `CC(C)CO` (isobutanol, secondary alcohol): **0.74872808** (positive).
   - `CC(C)(C)CO` (tert-butanol, tertiary alcohol): Likely similar or slightly less positive due to reduced polarity.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Tertiary alcohols are less polar than secondary alcohols, but still have some polarity from the -OH group.
- Branching tends to reduce the negative impact of polarity on the property.
- The closest example (`CC(C)CO`) has a positive value (**0.74872808**), and `CC(C)(C)CO` is even more branched.

The property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is likely **slightly positive but less than `CC(C)CO`**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is **0.65**.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.3783144560847458
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is:

**O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**

This is a purine-like structure with two nitrogen-containing rings and a carbonyl group (C=O). Let's analyze the features that likely influence the property:

1. **Nitrogen-rich heterocycles**: Molecules with multiple nitrogens in aromatic rings (e.g., pyrimidines, imidazoles) tend to have negative property values in the examples (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has -0.617, `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has -0.510).  
2. **Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: The presence of `[nH]` (NH groups) and C=O suggests strong hydrogen bonding, which often correlates with more negative values.  
3. **Conjugated system**: The fused aromatic rings with conjugation may slightly reduce the negativity compared to non-conjugated systems, but the nitrogen content dominates.  

Comparing to similar molecules:  
- `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (-0.617) has a similar imidazole/pyrimidine core with substituents.  
- `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (-0.510) lacks the C=O but has more nitrogens.  

The queried molecule has both C=O and multiple NH groups, likely pushing the value further negative than these examples.  

**Predicted property value: -0.72**  
*(Rationale: Closer to the more negative end of similar nitrogen-rich heterocycles, accounting for the additional hydrogen-bonding capability.)*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.39846642783083314
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -C=O, -N-, halogens) tend to have lower (more negative) property values, especially when these groups are exposed or not sterically hindered.
   - Nonpolar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains, aromatic rings without polar substituents) tend to increase the property value (more positive).

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): Property = **-0.73241919** (polar -OH group dominates).
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**: Property = **-0.81995363** (highly polar phosphate group).
   - **CCCOC(C)C**: Property = **0.35529381** (ether + alkyl chain, less polar than alcohols).
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...**: Property = **-1.00648709** (ester + complex polar structure).
   - **CCC(C)(C)C**: Property = **0.61382628** (fully nonpolar branched alkane).

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - Contains an **ester group (-OC=O)**, which is polar but less polar than a free -OH or -C=O alone (due to the electron-donating -O-).
   - Also has a small nonpolar **isopropyl group (CC(C))**.
   - Compared to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, -0.732), the ester is less polar, so the property value should be higher (less negative).
   - Compared to **CCCOC(C)C** (ether, 0.355), the ester is more polar, so the property value should be lower (more negative).

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar ester and the nonpolar isopropyl group, the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** should be between **-0.5 and 0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.35**  

This aligns with the trend where esters are less polar than alcohols but more polar than ethers or pure hydrocarbons.

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.4457500856782012
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea moiety (**N-C(=O)-N**). 
   - Urea-like structures in the examples (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) have property values around **-0.778**.
   - However, this molecule has two aromatic rings directly attached to the urea, which may influence the property differently.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule has two **phenyl groups** (benzene rings). 
   - Aromatic systems with electron-donating or withdrawing groups affect the property. For example:
     - `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (phenol + chloro substituent) has a value of **-0.927**.
     - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (toluene + amino substituent) has a value of **+0.839** (due to the electron-donating amine).
   - Here, the phenyl rings are neutral (no substituents), but the urea linker may slightly withdraw electron density.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: The molecule is symmetric and conjugated (the urea carbonyl can delocalize into the phenyl rings). 
   - Conjugated systems like `c1ccncc1` (pyridine) have a value of **-0.755**.
   - The urea linker adds polarity but also rigidity.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (urethane with aromatic ring) has **-0.847**.
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide with aromatic ring) has **-0.829**.
   - The urea linker here is more polar than a simple amide or urethane, but the two phenyl rings may balance this.

### Prediction:
Given the urea core and two phenyl rings, the property value is likely **negative** (due to polarity) but not as extreme as highly polar or halogenated examples. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.7 and -0.8**, similar to other urea/amide-aromatic hybrids in the dataset.

**Final predicted property value: -0.78**  
*(This aligns with the trend for polar, conjugated, aromatic-urea systems in the examples.)*

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.026833278202757688
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused benzene rings.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic systems** with extended conjugation (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, property = 0.316) tend to have moderately positive values.
2. **Smaller aromatic systems** (e.g., `Sc1ccccc1`, property = -0.632) or those with electronegative substituents (e.g., `Fc1cccc(F)c1`, property = -0.574) tend to have negative values.
3. Fluorene is similar to the molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (property = 0.316) but with one fewer ring and a bridging methylene group, which slightly reduces conjugation compared to fully fused systems.

### Prediction:
Fluorene's property value is likely **positive but lower** than the fully fused example above due to its reduced conjugation and lack of additional rings. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

This aligns with the trend where larger, more conjugated aromatic systems have higher positive values, while smaller or less conjugated systems have lower or negative values.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.8532304326513921
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)**, which is highly polar and often associated with moderate to low property values in the dataset (e.g., sulfonamides or similar polar groups tend to have values in the range of -0.2 to 0.5).
   - It also has **two primary amines (NC(=N)N and c1ccc(N)cc1)**, which add polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Amines in the dataset vary widely, but polar amines often correlate with lower or mid-range values (e.g., **NNc1ccccc1** has -0.102, while **CNN** has 0.272).

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The **para-substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(N)cc1)** is present, which is common in the dataset. Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, N) often have values in the mid-range (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** has 0.958, but **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has -0.893). The presence of an electron-donating **NH2** group may slightly lower the value compared to halogens.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (0.413): Contains polar amide and aromatic rings.
   - **N(CC)CC** (not in dataset, but similar to polar amines): Values for such groups are often modest.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (0.715): Highly halogenated aromatic, but our molecule is less hydrophobic and more polar due to NH2/SO2.

4. **Overall Polarity**:
   - The combination of **sulfonamide + two amines** suggests high polarity, likely leading to a value lower than aromatic-heavy or nonpolar molecules but higher than very polar/hydrophilic molecules like **OCc1ccccc1** (-1.017).

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of polar groups and aromaticity, the predicted property value is likely in the **low to mid-positive range**, similar to other polar aromatic compounds in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.25**  

This aligns with the influence of the sulfonamide (moderate polarity) and the aromatic amine (slightly increasing the value compared to purely aliphatic polar molecules).

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.009059997939162
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, carbonyls), and overall molecular complexity. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`

### Key structural features:
1. **Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** – These are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which in the examples tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of -0.755, `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has -1.017).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`)** – Highly electronegative and lipophilic, often associated with lower property values (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has -1.017).
3. **Tertiary amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`)** – Neutral but with some steric bulk, which may slightly increase the property value (e.g., `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1` has 0.930).
4. **Aromatic ring with substituents** – The disubstituted benzene ring with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups is highly polar and electron-deficient, likely reducing the property value.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- Molecules with multiple nitro groups and halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`) have very negative values (~-1.0).  
- The presence of the tertiary amine might offset this slightly, but the strong electron-withdrawing effects dominate.

### Predicted property value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, the property value is likely **negative and close to -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.95**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar highly polar, nitro-substituted aromatic systems in the provided examples.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.39846642783083314
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: 
     - Molecules with aliphatic carbonyls (e.g., **CC(=O)N**, **CCCC=O**) tend to have negative values (around -0.6 to -0.2).
     - Aromatic carbonyls (e.g., **COC(=O)c1cccnc1**) can have positive values (e.g., 0.56).
   - **Ethers (C-O-C)**:
     - Simple ethers (e.g., **CCCCCCCCO**) have values close to zero or slightly negative (-0.028).
     - Ethers combined with carbonyls (e.g., **CC(C)CCOC=O**) have strongly negative values (-1.015).
   - **Branching**:
     - Branched aliphatic chains (e.g., **CC(C)(C)O**) often have more negative values than linear chains.
   - **Combined Effects**:
     - The molecule **CC(C)CCOC=O** (similar to **CC(C)OC=O** but with an extra carbon) has a strongly negative value (-1.015). This suggests that the combination of branching, ether, and carbonyl groups leads to highly negative values.

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- The structure is **isopropyl formate** (a branched ester: isopropoxy group attached to a formyl group).
- It has:
  - A branched aliphatic chain (**CC(C)**).
  - An ether linkage (**O**).
  - A carbonyl group (**C=O**).
- This is very similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (value: -1.015), but with one fewer carbon in the chain. The shorter chain might slightly reduce the magnitude of the negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (-1.015) and the slightly simpler structure, the predicted value for **CC(C)OC=O** would be slightly less negative but still in the same range. 

**Predicted value: -0.95** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is likely between -0.9 and -1.0.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.7956459178619562
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: Generally decreases the property value when present (e.g., `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` has -0.770, `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` has -0.276).
   - **Methyl (-CH3)**: Often increases the property value when present (e.g., `CC(C)C` has 0.957, `Cc1ccccc1C` has 0.957).
   - **Aromatic Rings**: Neutral or slightly positive/negative depending on substituents.

2. **Substitution Patterns**:
   - Molecules with multiple **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO2)** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has 0.958, `Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has 0.851).
   - Molecules with **electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH, -OCH3)** tend to have lower or negative values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` has 0.529, `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` has -0.474).

3. **Specific Examples Similar to Target Molecule**:
   - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (0.529): Has aromatic ring with -OH and -OCH3.
   - `c1ccccc1O` (-0.222): Phenol (aromatic + -OH).
   - `Cc1ccccc1C` (0.957): Toluene derivative (aromatic + -CH3).

### Target Molecule: **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**
- Structure: Aromatic ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 1 and 3 (meta to each other).
  - One hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 4 (para to one -CH3).
- The -OH is electron-donating and will likely reduce the property value, while the -CH3 groups are electron-donating but less strongly than -OH. The net effect is a balance between these substituents.

### Prediction:
Given the examples:
- Phenol (`c1ccccc1O`) has -0.222.
- Toluene derivatives (`Cc1ccccc1C`) have ~0.957.
- The target molecule has both -CH3 and -OH, so the value should be between these extremes, likely closer to the phenol due to the stronger effect of -OH.

**Predicted Property Value: ~0.25** (between 0.2 and 0.3, reflecting the competing effects of -CH3 and -OH). 

However, looking at `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (0.529), which has multiple -OH groups and still a positive value, the target molecule (with only one -OH and two -CH3) might be slightly higher. 

**Final Prediction: 0.35** (closer to the middle of the observed range for similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on substituent trends in the data.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.6135981766408594
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)(OC)** group (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**, **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**, **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.146 to +0.782**. 
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) seems to increase the property value, with iodine having the strongest effect (e.g., **I-substituted: 0.782**, **Br-substituted: -0.146**, **Cl-substituted: 0.552**).

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - The property is influenced by substituents on the aromatic ring. Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, I) increase the property, while electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH3, CH3) decrease it.
   - In **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, the aromatic ring has:
     - A **thioether (SC)** group, which is moderately electron-donating (similar to OCH3 but less polar).
     - A **methyl (C)** group, which is weakly electron-donating.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = **0.552**), where the aromatic ring has three Cl substituents (strong electron-withdrawing).
   - In the target molecule, the **SC** and **C** substituents are less electron-withdrawing than Cl, so we expect a lower property value than **0.552** but still positive due to the **P(=S)** group's influence.

4. **Thioether (SC) Effect**:
   - Thioethers are less polar than ethers (OCH3) but still contribute some electron density. For example, **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has a property of **-0.825**, while **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** has **0.591** due to Cl substitution. The **SC** group is less electron-donating than **O**, so the property should be higher than **-0.825** but lower than Cl-substituted analogs.

### Predicted Property:
Given the **P(=S)** group's contribution (positive effect) and the **SC**/**C** substituents (moderately reducing the property compared to Cl), the predicted property for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is approximately:

**0.35**  

This is based on:
- The **P(=S)** group's tendency to give positive values (e.g., **0.552** for the Cl-substituted analog).
- The **SC** and **C** substituents reducing the property compared to Cl (but not as much as OCH3 or OH). 

Thus, the final predicted value is **0.35**.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.8740313715101966
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.67449076**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.47641379**
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **-0.93853797**

   These molecules are heavily chlorinated aromatic systems. The property tends to be **positive but decreases as the number of chlorines increases further** (e.g., the last example with 5 chlorines is negative).

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with **6 chlorines** (similar to the examples above but with slightly different substitution patterns).

3. **Trend**:
   - The property seems to **decrease with increasing chlorine count** but remains positive unless the molecule is very heavily chlorinated or has other polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl in the negative example).

### Prediction:
The target molecule has **6 chlorines**, which is more than the first two examples (5 and 6 chlorines, respectively) but less symmetric than the third example (5 chlorines with a hydroxyl). Given the trend:
- The first example (5 chlorines) has a property of **0.67449076**.
- The second example (6 chlorines) has a property of **0.47641379**.
- The third example (5 chlorines + hydroxyl) is negative (**-0.93853797**).

Since the target molecule has **6 chlorines and no hydroxyl**, its property should be **slightly lower than the first example but still positive**, likely **between 0.4 and 0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the closest structural match is **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **0.47641379**), and the target molecule has a similar chlorine count but slightly less symmetry, I predict:

**Predicted property: 0.50** (rounded to two decimal places for clarity). 

This aligns with the trend of decreasing but still positive values for highly chlorinated aromatics.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8807355784720994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have lower (often negative) property values. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (multiple nitro groups): **-0.09429305**
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`: **-0.21484521**
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (no nitro group but nitriles): **0.03269372**
   - The presence of nitro groups seems to reduce the property value.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`): **-0.05978795**
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC`): **-0.3004473**
   - Alkyl chains alone tend to give slightly negative values, but the effect is not as strong as nitro groups.

3. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` has a short alkyl chain (propyl, `CCC`) and a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).
   - From the examples, nitro groups dominate the property value, pushing it toward negative values.
   - The alkyl chain (`CCC`) is short, so its contribution is minor (likely slightly negative or neutral).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitro groups strongly reduce the property value (often to negative values).
- The propyl chain (`CCC`) is short and would contribute a small negative or neutral effect.

The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** should be **negative**, likely in the range of **-0.1 to -0.3**. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `CCC` alone: **-0.05978795**
- `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`: **-0.21484521** (more complex, but two nitro groups)
- `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O`: **-0.09429305** (three nitro groups)

For **CCCN(=O)=O**, with one nitro group and a short alkyl chain, a reasonable prediction is:
**-0.15**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.15**.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.9509917595813188
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends based on molecular features that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### 1. **Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:**
   - The molecule is **4-bromofluorobenzene** (a benzene ring with fluorine at position 1 and bromine at position 4).
   - Substituents: 
     - Fluorine (F) is highly electronegative and tends to withdraw electron density inductively but can donate electron density through resonance (weakly).
     - Bromine (Br) is a moderate electron-withdrawing group (inductive effect) and can donate weakly through resonance.

### 2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:**
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (4-bromochlorobenzene): Property = **-0.89338502**
     - Similar to our target but with Cl instead of F. Cl is less electronegative than F but has similar resonance effects.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c1** (dichlorobenzene, not explicitly in the dataset but analogous): Likely similar to the above but with two Cl groups.
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (4-chloroanisole): Property = **0.03487628**
     - Here, the methoxy (OCH3) group is strongly electron-donating (+M effect), which likely increases the property value compared to halogens.
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl** (chloroanisole, same as above): Property = **0.03487628** (same as above, confirming consistency).
   - **BrC(Br)Br** (bromoform): Property = **0.67428076**
     - This is an aliphatic brominated compound, so not directly comparable to aromatic systems.

### 3. **Key Observations:**
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values when the halogens are the only substituents (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 = -0.893).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH3) increase the property value toward or above zero.
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl but similar in resonance effects. Thus, **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** should have a property value slightly higher than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.893) because F is slightly less electron-withdrawing through resonance than Cl.

### 4. **Adjustment for Fluorine vs. Chlorine:**
   - Fluorine's stronger inductive effect might slightly lower the property value compared to Cl, but its weaker resonance donation might offset this. Overall, the property value should be close to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but slightly less negative.
   - A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.80 and -0.90**.

### 5. **Final Prediction:**
   - Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.893) and adjusting for fluorine's effects, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is:
     **-0.85**

### Supporting Evidence:
   - The presence of two halogens (F and Br) is analogous to the Cl/Br case, but F is slightly less deactivating through resonance than Cl, leading to a less negative value.
   - No strong electron-donating groups are present to push the value toward positive territory.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is:  
**-0.85**

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.8607589347807408
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary alcohol (C-OH)** and **tertiary carbon centers (C(C)(C)C)**. 
   - It has a **bicyclic structure** (two fused rings), which introduces rigidity and steric effects.

2. **Similarity to Examples**:
   - The molecule resembles steroids or terpenoid-like structures (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a property value of **0.48397514**). 
   - It also shares features with **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property value: **-0.13731413**), though our molecule lacks polar groups like carbonyls or halogens.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **C-OH** (alcohol) tends to increase the property value (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)O** has **0.76670289**).
   - Bicyclic structures with fewer polar groups (like ours) often have moderate values (e.g., **CC1CCCO1** has **-1.01932728**, but our molecule is more complex and has an alcohol).
   - The absence of highly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) suggests the value won't be extreme.

### Prediction:
Given the **tertiary alcohol** and **bicyclic structure**, the property value is likely **moderate and positive**, similar to other rigid, alcohol-containing molecules in the examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

*(This is close to the steroid-like example with a value of 0.48, but slightly lower due to fewer polar groups.)*

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.956825235950884
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will analyze the given molecule and predict its property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the dataset.

### Molecule to predict:
**SMILES:** `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`

### Structural analysis:
1. The molecule contains a **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)`), which is also present in one of the examples:
   - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a property value of **-0.9153154**.
   The main difference is the substitution of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` in the new molecule.

2. The new molecule also includes a **lactam-like structure** (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`), which resembles the following example:
   - `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2` with a property value of **-0.99916816**.
   However, the new molecule has an aromatic ring fused to the lactam, which may increase the property value compared to the aliphatic example.

3. The presence of **two ethoxy groups (`OCC`)** attached to the phosphorus suggests some polarity, but the thiophosphate (`P=S`) and aromatic lactam may dominate the property.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The closest match is `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (**-0.9153154**). The new molecule replaces `SC(CCl)` with another lactam-like group, which is slightly more polar but still retains the thiophosphate and aromatic character.
- The lactam-aromatic fusion (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) is somewhat similar to `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2` (**-0.99916816**), but the aromaticity likely raises the property value.

### Predicted property:
Given the structural similarities, the property value is expected to be close to **-0.9153154** (from the thiophosphate example) but slightly higher due to the additional aromatic lactam group. 

**Final prediction:** **-0.85** (rounded from an estimated range of -0.88 to -0.82). 

This balances the electron-withdrawing effects of the thiophosphate and lactam with the aromatic stabilization.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.3880750637187705
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core (two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring with a carbonyl group, resembling a uracil or hydantoin derivative). This is similar to some of the given examples with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups.
   - Example: `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` has a property of **0.93692953** (highly positive).
   - Example: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` has a property of **-1.01924452** (highly negative).

2. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule has two aromatic systems (a benzene ring and a pyridine-like ring with a carbonyl). Aromaticity often correlates with positive property values in the examples (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` has **0.38835607**).

3. **Substituents**: The molecule has two methyl groups (`Cc1...n1C`), which are simple alkyl groups. Alkyl groups alone don't strongly correlate with extreme values (e.g., `CCCC(C)(C)C` has **-0.26124589**).

4. **Polarity**: The carbonyl group (`C=O`) introduces polarity, which may influence the property. In some cases, carbonyls are associated with negative values (e.g., `CC(=O)SC4...` has **-1.0167325**), but in others, they are neutral or positive (e.g., `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has **-0.75206484**).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest structural analog in the given examples is likely `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a methylated purine-like structure), which has a property of **0.95957779**. This suggests that fused aromatic systems with nitrogen and carbonyl groups can have high positive values.
- Another similar example is `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` (a carbazole-like structure), with a property of **0.38835607**.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A fused aromatic system with nitrogen and carbonyl (similar to `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2`),
- Two methyl groups (not strongly influential),
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or bulky substituents,

the property is likely **positive and moderately high**, similar to the purine-like example. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity to high-value examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The actual value could vary slightly, but it should fall in the **0.7–1.0** range given the aromatic and heterocyclic features.)

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.010499198182274
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I can predict its property value based on structural features and trends observed in the dataset:

### Key Observations:
1. **Ester Group (-COO-)**: 
   - Molecules with ester groups (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**, **CC(=O)OC3CCC4...**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.4 to -0.8). 
   - However, **COC=O** (methyl formate) is an outlier with a high positive value (0.946), likely due to its small size and lack of hydrophobic contributions.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCC**, **CCCCCCCI**) tend to have negative values when polar groups are absent or weakly interacting. 
   - Here, the hexyl chain (**CCCCCC**) is nonpolar but balanced by the polar ester.

3. **Ethyl Group (OCC)**: 
   - Ethyl groups (e.g., in **CCOC(=O)N**) contribute to slightly more negative values compared to methyl esters.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)N** has a value of **-0.415**, and **CC(=O)OC...** (a steroid ester) has **0.914**, but the latter is influenced by its rigid polycyclic structure.
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is simpler, resembling **CCOC(=O)N** but with a longer hydrophobic tail.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a linear ester with a hexyl chain and ethyl ester group. Given the trends:
- The ester group pulls the value negative.
- The long hydrocarbon chain adds hydrophobicity but not enough to outweigh the ester's polarity.
- Similar esters in the dataset (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**) hover around **-0.4 to -0.8**.

**Predicted Property Value: -0.55**  
*(This is an estimate based on interpolation between similar structures in the dataset.)*

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.3180235127894346
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Ester Groups**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **0.08170301**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, with only a shorter alkyl chain (methyl instead of ethyl). The property value is likely close to ethyl benzoate's value but may differ slightly due to the smaller substituent.

2. **Effect of Substituents**:
   - Adding electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) tends to decrease the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2** has a very negative value).
   - Adding polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -NH2) can significantly affect the value, often lowering it (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cnccn1** has a negative value).
   - Simple esters like methyl/ethyl benzoate tend to have modest positive values.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: 0.08170301 (ethyl benzoate)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1**: 0.8104199 (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, higher due to -OH)
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is expected to be slightly lower than ethyl benzoate because the shorter alkyl chain (methyl) may reduce the hydrophobic contribution slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to ethyl benzoate and the absence of additional functional groups, the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely slightly lower than 0.08170301. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.07** (approximate, likely in the range of 0.05 to 0.10). 

This is based on the assumption that the property is influenced by the aromatic ring and ester group, with minor adjustments for the alkyl chain length. For a more precise prediction, additional data or a clearer definition of the property would be needed.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.7445586629040392
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C=C** (ethylene-like) or conjugated systems tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Example: **CC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene) has a value of **-0.61653543**.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene-like) has a value of **-0.09373278**, which is less negative due to the aromatic ring stabilizing the double bond.

2. **Saturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane) has a value of **-0.26124589**.
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a value of **-0.49029438**.

3. **Conjugated Dienes**:
   - The molecule **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene). Conjugation typically increases electron delocalization, which may slightly raise the property value compared to isolated double bonds but not as much as aromatic systems.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC/C=C/C** (isolated double bond): **-0.61653543**.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (double bond conjugated with aromatic ring): **-0.09373278**.
   - **C=CCC=C** (conjugated diene) should lie between these two, likely closer to the isolated double bond but less negative due to conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given the conjugation in **C=CCC=C**, the property value should be less negative than **CC/C=C/C** (-0.616) but more negative than **C=Cc1ccccc1** (-0.093). A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.4 to -0.5**. 

Looking at the examples, **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) is **-0.49029438**, which is a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon. A conjugated diene like 1,3-butadiene might have a similar or slightly less negative value due to conjugation. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is **-0.45**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.674280759887328
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (chlorinated): -0.959  
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated): 0.666  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (highly chlorinated): 0.476  
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (mixed halogens): 0.877  

   Halogenated compounds show a wide range of values, but brominated aromatics (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) tend to have positive values, while highly chlorinated aliphatics (e.g., **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) have negative values.

2. **Symmetry and Steric Effects**: 
   - Symmetric halogenated molecules like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** have moderate positive values (0.476), while **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (less symmetric) has a higher value (0.877).

3. **Brominated Aliphatics**: 
   - The only fully brominated aliphatic example is **BrC(Br)Br**. Comparing it to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (0.877), which has mixed halogens but is similarly sterically crowded, we might expect **BrC(Br)Br** to have a high positive value due to the polarizability of bromine atoms and symmetric crowding.

4. **Polarizability and Electronegativity**: 
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but more polarizable. This often leads to higher property values in brominated compounds (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** at 0.666 vs. chlorinated aromatics like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** at 0.476).

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
Given the trends:
- Highly brominated aliphatics with symmetric crowding (like **BrC(Br)Br**) likely have high positive values due to polarizability and steric effects. 
- The closest analog is **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (0.877), but **BrC(Br)Br** is fully brominated and symmetric, which may increase the value slightly.

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 0.92**  
(Justification: Slightly higher than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** due to full bromination and symmetry.)

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.9153154036314309
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.8379376). This group often contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, similar to many examples with aromaticity (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2**, property = 0.17074384). Aromaticity alone doesn't dominate but can influence the value.
3. **Chlorine substitution (CCl)**: Present, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.71515846). Chlorine can increase the property value, especially with multiple substitutions.
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: A cyclic amide, similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = -0.89733481), but the latter has more electronegative substitutions (Cl). Lactams can vary in their contribution.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Present, similar to **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = 0.90944458). Ether/ethoxy groups often contribute positively.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines features from **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.8379376) and **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (-0.89733481). The phosphorothioate group is a strong positive contributor, while the lactam and chlorine substitution may moderate the value.
- The presence of **P(=S)** and **OCC** groups suggests a higher property value, but the **CCl** and lactam may slightly reduce it compared to purely phosphorothioate-dominated examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of these features, the property value is likely **positive but slightly lower than the phosphorothioate-dominated examples**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with values in the 0.6–0.8 range). 

This aligns with the contributions of the phosphorothioate (strong positive), aromaticity (moderate), and chlorine/lactam (slightly negative or neutral).

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.49677616832713495
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C  

### Key structural features:
1. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Present in many molecules with negative property values (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -0.537, CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O: -0.158).  
2. **Chlorine substitution (Cl)**: Often associated with negative or near-zero values (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: -0.606, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl: 0.715).  
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (n2nc(oc2=O))**: Similar to N-containing heterocycles like Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 (0.887), but with additional complexity.  
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: Often reduces the property value (e.g., CCC(C)C: -0.945).  
5. **Aromatic system with polar substituents**: Mixed effects depending on substituents.  

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The amide and Cl substitution suggest a negative contribution.  
- The heterocycle could slightly increase the value, but the bulky tert-butyl group and additional polar groups likely offset this.  
- Overall, the molecule resembles cases where polar/negative contributions dominate (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -0.537, CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O: -0.158).  

### Predicted property value:
Given the balance of features, a reasonable estimate is **-0.45**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend of structural contributions in the provided data.)

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.30678441531743655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of -0.93853797).
   - However, single Cl substitutions can have positive or negative values depending on other functional groups (e.g., `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has -0.31302712, while `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has 0.59120862).

2. **Phenol-like Structures (O attached to aromatic rings)**:
   - Phenols (`Oc1ccccc1`) often have positive values unless heavily substituted with halogens or other electronegative groups.
   - Example: `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has 0.59120862, while `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has -0.93853797.

3. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - Symmetrical molecules with multiple halogens tend to have more negative values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has -0.20267289).
   - The given molecule is symmetrical with three Cl atoms and two phenol groups.

4. **Ether Linkages (Oc1ccc1Oc2ccc2)**:
   - Ether linkages (like in `Oc1ccc1Oc2ccc2`) are present in the target molecule. From the examples, such structures with halogens tend to have negative values.

### Target Molecule: **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**
- It has:
  - Two phenol groups (O attached to aromatic rings).
  - Three Cl substitutions (two on one ring, one on the other).
  - An ether linkage connecting two aromatic rings.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.59120862) has fewer Cl atoms and no ether linkage.
  - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-0.93853797) has more Cl substitutions but no ether linkage.
  - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (-0.20267289) has two Cl atoms and a biphenyl structure.

### Prediction:
The molecule is likely to have a **negative property value** due to:
- Multiple Cl substitutions (three Cl atoms).
- Symmetrical structure with ether linkage.
- Phenol groups are offset by the electronegative Cl atoms.

Given the similarity to `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-0.93853797) but with one fewer Cl and an ether linkage, the value should be less negative. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.6165354284247254
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`CC/C=C\C`  
This is **2-pentene**, a simple alkene with a trans double bond (indicated by the `\` and `/` notation). 

**Similar examples from the data:**  
1. `CC/C=C/C` (property: **-0.61653543**) – This is also a pentene, but likely the cis isomer (or another conformation).  
2. `CCCC(=O)OC` (property: **-0.01639249**) – An ester, more polar than an alkene.  
3. `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (property: **-1.0153561**) – A long alkane, very nonpolar.  

**Observations:**  
- Alkenes (like `CC/C=C/C`) tend to have moderately negative property values, likely due to their slight polarity from the pi bond.  
- The trans isomer (`CC/C=C\C`) is typically less polar than the cis isomer due to symmetry and reduced dipole moment.  
- The property value for `CC/C=C/C` is **-0.61653543**, so the trans isomer might be slightly less negative (closer to zero) due to its lower polarity.  

**Prediction:**  
For `CC/C=C\C`, I predict a property value of **-0.55**, slightly higher (less negative) than the cis-like example due to reduced polarity.  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)*  

**Final answer:**  
**-0.55**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.052554154695084544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate to low property values. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` has a value of **0.65973585** (but this is a complex molecule with multiple functional groups).
     - Simpler ethers like `COc1ccccc1O` (anisole derivative) have values around **-0.16436922**.
   - Ethers alone do not seem to strongly increase the property value.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Linear alkanes or simple branched alkanes (e.g., `CC(C)O` with **-0.73241919**, `CC(C)Cl` with **0.95347283**) show that branching can affect the property, but no clear trend is obvious.
   - Longer chains (e.g., `CCCCCCC=C` with **-0.72883584**) tend to have negative values.

3. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - Polar groups like alcohols (`-OH`) often correlate with negative values (e.g., `CCC(O)CC` with **-1.00700662**).
   - Non-polar or weakly polar groups (e.g., ethers) tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative.

4. **Specific Case of CCCOCC**:
   - This is a simple, symmetrical ether (diethyl ether) with no strong polar or functionalized groups beyond the ether oxygen.
   - It is less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.
   - Comparing to similar-sized molecules:
     - `CCCCCC` (hexane) is not in the examples, but `C1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexane) has **0.41078563**.
     - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) has **-0.73241919**, but this is more polar due to the -OH group.
   - Ethers are intermediate in polarity, so the value is likely between the alcohol and hydrocarbon examples.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCCOCC** is expected to have a property value slightly negative but closer to zero than alcohols. A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.3 to -0.5**. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `COc1ccccc1O` (anisole-like) has **-0.16436922**, but this has aromatic stabilization.
- `CCC(O)CC` (pentanol) has **-1.00700662**, but this is an alcohol.
- `CCCCCCC=C` (heptene) has **-0.72883584**, but this is a non-polar hydrocarbon.

Since **CCCOCC** is less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons, a value around **-0.4** seems plausible. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-0.42**.

Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.3700207375727571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide group**: `C(=O)N` (present in many examples, often associated with moderate property values).
   - **Tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)c1ccccc1` (bulky hydrophobic group, similar to some examples with phenyl rings and alkyl substitutions).
   - **Two phenyl rings**: `c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2` (aromaticity is common in the examples, with varying effects on the property).

2. **Polarity and Hydrophobicity**:
   - The amide group introduces polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl and two phenyl rings dominate, making the molecule largely hydrophobic.
   - Similar molecules with amides and aromatic rings (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`, property = 0.48965325) suggest moderate values.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.48965325): Similar amide + aromatic structure, but slightly more polar due to the thiazole ring. Our molecule is more hydrophobic.
   - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = 0.95462288): Pure hydrophobic (two phenyl rings + alkyl), very high value. Our molecule has an amide, which should reduce hydrophobicity.
   - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = 0.50237475): Aromatic + amine, moderate value.

4. **Expected Property**:
   - The amide group will lower the property compared to purely hydrophobic molecules like `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`.
   - The tert-butyl group adds bulk but not as much hydrophobicity as long alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCC` has 0.95238352, but our molecule is more complex).
   - A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (0.48965325) due to reduced polarity.

### Predicted Property:
**0.45** (moderate, slightly hydrophobic due to aromatic rings and tert-butyl, balanced by the polar amide). 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where amides with aromatic rings tend to have property values in the 0.4-0.6 range.

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.41709060776087953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituents and Functional Groups**:
   - **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Br, NO₂, Cl)** tend to have higher (more positive) property values. Examples:
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 0.95099176 (Br and F)
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`: 0.88946945 (NO₂)
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`: -0.99291022 (Cl, but note this is an outlier; likely due to symmetry or other factors).
   - **Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH₂, OCH₃)** tend to have lower (more negative) property values. Examples:
     - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1`: -1.01582698 (OH and CHO)
     - `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C`: -0.79564592 (OH).
   - **Amide groups (CONH)** appear in molecules with mixed property values, but when combined with electron-withdrawing groups, they may increase the value. Example:
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.37002074 (amide with bulky groups).

2. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine on an aromatic ring often correlates with higher property values (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 0.95099176, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`: -1.00193745, but the latter is likely due to multiple Br atoms causing symmetry or steric effects).

3. **Specific Examples Similar to the Target Molecule**:
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: 0.83881988 (methyl and NH₂ on aromatic ring).
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: -0.972977 (OH and Br on aromatic ring; OH dominates the effect).
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (not in the list, but analogous to the target): Likely similar to amide-containing examples.

### Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- The molecule has:
  - An **amide group (CONH)** attached to an aromatic ring.
  - A **bromine substituent** on the aromatic ring (electron-withdrawing).
  - No strongly electron-donating groups (like OH or NH₂) to counteract the Br effect.
- The amide group is neutral to slightly polar, while the Br is electron-withdrawing, likely increasing the property value.
- Similar molecules:
  - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: 0.83881988 (NH₂ instead of CONH, but similar).
  - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 0.95099176 (Br and F, both electron-withdrawing).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the electron-withdrawing Br and the amide group, the property value is likely **positive and moderately high**, similar to other Br-containing aromatic compounds. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.75** (range: 0.7 to 0.9 based on similar examples).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking closer:
- `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (NH₂): 0.83881988  
- `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (CONH and Br): Br is more electron-withdrawing than NH₂ is donating, so the value should be slightly lower than 0.838 but still positive.  
- `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` (Br + F): 0.95099176 (higher due to F).  

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.80** (closer to the NH₂ example but adjusted for Br). 

### Final Answer:
**0.80**

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5848942028875157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): **0.83881988**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **0.95701501**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (polycyclic aromatic): **0.31632063**
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methylnaphthalene): **-0.70235283**
   - **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine): **0.88633978**

   These examples suggest that simple alkyl-substituted benzenes (e.g., methyl, ethyl) tend to have **positive property values** (often between **0.7 and 1.0**), while bulkier or polycyclic systems may deviate.

2. **Branched Alkyl Groups**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **0.74872808**
   - **CC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol): **-0.44544822**
   - **CC(C)CCCO** (branched chain): **-0.06926531**

   Branched alkyl groups alone do not show a clear trend, but when attached to an aromatic ring, they may slightly reduce the property value compared to linear alkyl groups.

3. **Isobutylbenzene-Like Structures**:
   - The closest example is **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene), which has a high value (**0.95701501**). 
   - **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has a branched isobutyl group instead of a linear ethyl group, which might slightly lower the value due to increased sterics.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyltoluene (**CCc1ccc(C)cc1**) has a value of **0.95701501**.
- Branched alkyl groups (e.g., isobutyl) may slightly reduce the value compared to linear alkyls.

The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene) would be slightly lower than ethyltoluene but still in the **high positive range** (likely between **0.8 and 0.9**).

### Final Prediction:
**0.87** (estimated based on the closest analogs and structural adjustments).

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.4759469345188248
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.10633924  
     (Polar groups like -OH and -NHCO reduce the property value.)
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): 0.91347117  
     (Less polar -OCH3 increases the value compared to -OH.)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 0.49846937  
     (Strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups reduce the value compared to alkyl/alkoxy.)

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (unsaturated ketone): 0.81285479  
     (Aliphatic ketone increases the value.)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): 0.64781407  
     (Conjugated carbonyl lowers value compared to aliphatic.)

3. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** has an aldehyde (-CHO) directly attached to a benzene ring.  
     Aldehydes are electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to nitro or amide groups but less so than -OH or -NO2.

### Comparison with Closest Examples:
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.10633924  
  (More polar than benzaldehyde due to -OH and -NHCO.)
- **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): 0.91347117  
  (Less polar than benzaldehyde; -OCH3 is electron-donating.)
- **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 0.49846937  
  (More electron-withdrawing than benzaldehyde.)

### Prediction:
The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is moderately electron-withdrawing but less polar than -NO2 or -OH. From the examples:
- The value likely lies between **0.91347117** (methoxybenzene, less polar) and **-0.10633924** (amide + phenol, more polar).  
- A reasonable estimate is closer to the middle, but leaning toward the lower end due to the carbonyl's polarity.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: 0.25**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trend that electron-withdrawing groups reduce the property value, and benzaldehyde's polarity is intermediate between the given examples.)*

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.23383146327347365
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), one of which is part of a cyclic urea-like structure (imidazolidine-2,4-dione core).
   - A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) attached to an aromatic ring.
   - An aromatic ether (**O** linking the aromatic ring to the rest of the molecule).
   - A conjugated system with alternating single and double bonds.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may decrease the property value (as seen in other nitro-containing molecules like `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` with a value of -0.419).
   - The cyclic urea/amide structure is polar and may contribute to intermediate property values (similar to other polar heterocycles like `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` with -0.005).
   - The aromatic ether could slightly increase the property (as in `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` with 0.034).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative or low-positive values (e.g., -0.419, -0.370 for `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`).
   - Heterocycles with polar groups (e.g., amides) often have values around 0 to 0.6 (e.g., `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23` with 0.384).
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (two amides + nitro) suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing and polar effects.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group and polar amide/cyclic urea moieties, the property value is likely to be **moderately positive but not high**. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.2 to 0.4**, leaning toward the lower end due to the nitro group's dominant effect.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.25** (specific value within the expected range). 

This aligns with the trend where nitro-containing molecules with additional polar groups tend to have values slightly above zero but not as high as purely aromatic or non-nitro polar molecules.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.8063489554441193
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.88348246**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **-0.508044**.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond (hydrazine-linked diphenyl vs. azo-linked diphenyl).
   - The presence of two phenyl rings linked by a nitrogen-nitrogen single bond (hydrazine derivative) is expected to have a slightly more negative property value than the azo compound due to reduced conjugation and electron delocalization.

3. **Trends**:
   - Adding nitrogen atoms or nitrogen-containing groups to aromatic systems tends to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - The azo compound (**N=N**) has a less negative value than the hydrazine derivative (**N-N**), as the latter lacks the stabilizing conjugation of the azo group.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) is **-0.88348246**,
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azo) is **-0.508044**,
the hydrazine derivative **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is expected to have a value between these two, closer to the aniline value but less negative than the azo compound due to the lack of conjugation.

A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than the azo compound but less negative than aniline. 

**Predicted property value: -0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation from the examples). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the provided data. The value is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.7**. For precision, you would need more examples of hydrazine derivatives or the specific property being measured. 

However, based on the closest analog (**N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** at **-0.508044**), and accounting for the reduced conjugation in the hydrazine form, **-0.65** is a plausible prediction. 

**Final answer: -0.65** (approximate).

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.7406025188445086
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring). This is reminiscent of a cyclic imide or hydantoin-like structure.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity, which often correlates with lower (more negative) property values in the given dataset.
3. **Rigidity**: The fused ring system introduces rigidity, which may influence the property value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -0.77803585): This is a cyclic urea/amide derivative with some structural similarity (cyclic, polar amides). The property is negative and moderately large in magnitude.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -1.01924452): This is another cyclic imide-like structure with additional alkyl chains, yielding a highly negative property.
- **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.80533479): This is a simpler lactam (cyclic amide), but the property is positive, likely due to the lack of additional polar groups or ring strain.

### Observations:
- Cyclic structures with multiple amide groups (e.g., imides) tend to have negative property values in the dataset.
- The molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is most similar to cyclic imides with fused rings, which have strongly negative values (e.g., -0.778 to -1.019).
- The absence of bulky alkyl groups (like in **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**) suggests the property may not be as extreme as -1.019 but still significantly negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to cyclic imides and the trend in the dataset, a reasonable prediction for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is:

**-0.85** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar molecules). 

This balances the influence of the polar amides (pushing the value negative) and the fused ring system (which may not be as extreme as the most negative examples).

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.9577060003364753
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.99291022**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **-0.19243033**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.34814426**.

2. **Polyhalogenated Aromatic Systems**:
   - Heavier halogenation (e.g., multiple Cl or Br atoms) tends to reduce the property value further, but the effect is not strictly additive. For example, **ClC(Br)Br** has a value of **-0.30028876**, which is less negative than dichlorobenzene.

3. **Biphenyl Systems**:
   - The biphenyl core with chlorination (**Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**) is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, but with fewer Cl atoms. The latter has a value of **-0.19243033**, suggesting that the biphenyl scaffold with moderate chlorination may not be as negative as single-ring chlorinated aromatics.

4. **Trend**:
   - Single-ring chlorinated aromatics (e.g., dichlorobenzene) have very negative values (~ -1.0).
   - Biphenyl systems with chlorination are less negative (~ -0.2 to -0.5).
   - The given molecule is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** (two chlorines on each ring), so its value should lie between the extremes of dichlorobenzene and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl example.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl** (or similar dichlorinated biphenyl). Given the examples:
- Dichlorobenzene: **-0.99291022**
- Heavily chlorinated biphenyl: **-0.19243033**

A dichlorinated biphenyl would likely have a property value closer to the latter but slightly more negative due to the symmetrical chlorination. A reasonable estimate is **-0.4 to -0.6**.

Looking at other examples:
- **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): **-0.34814426**
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(...)** (heavily chlorinated): **-0.19243033**

A symmetrical dichlorobiphenyl would likely be more negative than chlorobenzene but less negative than dichlorobenzene. Splitting the difference, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**

### Final Answer:
**-0.55** (approximate, based on structural analogies and trends in the given data).

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.11967467268926608
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is present in many of the examples. Aromatic rings often contribute positively to the property value unless heavily substituted with electronegative or bulky groups.
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline) has a property value of **0.83881988**.
   - Example: **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a property value of **-0.61798488**. The long aliphatic chain likely reduces the property value.

2. **Alkyl Substituents**: The molecule has two ethyl groups (**-CC**) attached to the benzene ring. Alkyl groups are generally electron-donating and not highly polar, so they may moderately increase the property value compared to unsubstituted benzene or heavily polar-substituted benzene.
   - Example: **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (a terpene-like structure) has a value of **0.81285479**, showing that alkylation can lead to higher values.
   - Example: **CCCC(=O)CC** (a ketone with alkyl chains) has a value of **0.66730339**.

3. **Symmetry and Simplicity**: The molecule is symmetric and lacks polar or functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -COOH), which often reduce the property value when present. Simpler alkylbenzenes tend to have higher values unless the alkyl chain is very long.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline, 0.83881988): This has a slightly polar -NH2 group, which may increase the value compared to pure alkylbenzenes.
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene, -0.61798488): The long alkyl chain drags the value down significantly.
- **CC(=O)c1ccccc1** (acetophenone, 0.47594693): The polar carbonyl group reduces the value compared to alkylbenzenes.

Given that **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is a dialkylbenzene with short ethyl groups and no polar substituents, its property value should be:
- Higher than hexylbenzene (-0.61798488) due to shorter alkyl chains.
- Slightly lower than methylaniline (0.83881988) due to the lack of a polar -NH2 group.
- Comparable to other alkylbenzenes or simple aromatic systems with moderate substitution.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**. This aligns with the trend where symmetric, lightly alkylated aromatics have high values but not as high as those with polar groups like -NH2.

**Final Answer: 0.75** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples).

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7259400214729345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)** and **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**:
   - Molecules with strong EWGs (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, sulfonyl groups `S(=O)(=O)`, halogens) tend to have **lower or negative property values** when combined with aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has 0.41661581, while `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -1.01550189).
   - EDGs (e.g., `NH2`, `OCH3`) can increase the property value when not counterbalanced by EWGs (e.g., `Oc1ccncc1` has 0.88998847).

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with no substituents or only alkyl groups tend to have **negative or low values** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1` has -0.73200269, `Cc1ccc(C)cc1` has -0.26860638).
   - Aromatic systems with polar substituents (especially EWGs) further reduce the property value.

3. **Sulfonamide Group (`S(N)(=O)=O`)**:
   - The sulfonamide group is a strong EWG and is likely to **decrease the property value** significantly, similar to nitro groups.

4. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (aniline with nitro group) has a very low value of **-1.01550189**.
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` replaces the nitro group with a sulfonamide group, which is similarly electron-withdrawing but may have a slightly less severe effect than the nitro group due to the nitrogen in the sulfonamide acting as a weak EDG in resonance.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group and the aromatic system with an EDG (`NH2`), the property value is expected to be **negative and close to the nitro-substituted analog**. However, the sulfonamide is slightly less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, so the value may be marginally higher (less negative).

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend that sulfonamide is less electron-withdrawing than nitro but still strongly reduces the property value.)*

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.8081777424770965
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (specifically, it is **pyrene**). The structure can be broken down as follows:
- It has a central core of four fused rings with alternating single and double bonds (aromatic).
- The molecule is planar and highly conjugated, which typically influences electronic properties.

### Comparison to Examples:
From the given examples, we can observe trends for similar PAHs:
1. **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: **0.58767589**): This is a PAH with 4 fused rings (similar to the given molecule but with a methyl group and an additional ring). The property is moderately positive.
2. **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property: **-0.58684864**): This is a larger PAH (5-6 fused rings), and the property is negative.
3. **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: **0.72057224**): A smaller PAH (3 fused rings) with a methyl group; the property is positive.
4. **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** (property: **0.95365754**): A heterocyclic aromatic system (not a PAH), but highly conjugated, leading to a high positive value.

### Key Observations:
- Smaller PAHs (2-3 rings) tend to have positive property values.
- Larger PAHs (5+ rings) tend to have negative property values.
- The given molecule (pyrene, 4 fused rings) is intermediate in size. From the examples, **4-ring PAHs seem to have properties around 0.5 to 0.7** unless heavily substituted with electronegative groups (e.g., halogens, which lower the value).

### Predicted Property:
Given the conjugation and lack of electronegative substituents, the property should be **moderately positive**. The closest analog is **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (0.58767589)**, which is structurally similar (though not identical). 

Thus, the predicted property for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is approximately:  
**0.62** (rounded from an estimated range of 0.6–0.65). 

### Final Answer:
**0.62**

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.7705949285517173
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, which often decreases the property value (as seen in examples like `Oc1cccc(O)c1` with a value of -0.825).
2. **Aromatic rings**: The presence of aromatic systems (e.g., benzene rings) can influence the property, but the effect depends on substitution.
3. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: This adds polarity but is less impactful than hydroxyl groups in the examples (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` has a value of 0.850, but this is likely due to other factors like cyclic structure).
4. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: This is less polar than hydroxyl groups and may slightly increase the property.

### Observations from examples:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1`) tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) or non-polar substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tend to have higher positive values.
- The presence of carbonyls or ethers alone does not strongly correlate with negative values unless combined with hydroxyl groups.

### Prediction:
This molecule has **four hydroxyl groups**, an aromatic system, and a carbonyl group. The high density of polar -OH groups suggests a strong tendency toward hydrogen bonding and polarity, which aligns with the examples showing negative property values for such structures (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` at -0.825). The carbonyl and ether may slightly offset this, but the dominant effect is likely from the hydroxyls.

### Predicted property value:
**-0.85**  
*(This is consistent with the trend observed for highly hydroxylated aromatic systems in the examples.)*

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.9652193239773632
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate or thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **moderate positive values** (e.g., 0.552).
   - The presence of **P=O** (as in `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) gives a **negative value (-0.352)** when combined with highly chlorinated aromatic rings, but this may not be the dominant factor here.

2. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.829).
   - However, when combined with other polar or aromatic groups, the effect may vary.

3. **Thioether (S-C) or thiol (S-H) groups**:
   - Molecules with sulfur (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) have **slightly negative values** (-0.134).
   - But sulfur in thiophosphate (P=S) can increase the value (e.g., 0.552).

4. **Combination of P=O, amide, and S-C**:
   - The molecule `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` has:
     - A **phosphate group (P=O)**,
     - An **amide (NC=O)**,
     - A **thioether (S-C)**.
   - The phosphate group likely dominates, giving a **positive value**, but the amide and thioether may moderate it slightly.

5. **Similar molecules**:
   - `COP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has a **P=S and amide**, yielding **0.123**.
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **P=O and Cl-aromatic**, yielding **-0.352**.
   - The absence of chlorinated aromatics here suggests a **less negative or positive value**.

### Prediction:
Given the **P=O group's dominance** and the **moderating effects of the amide and thioether**, the property value is likely **slightly positive**, similar to other phosphate-containing molecules but not as high as those with P=S or aromatic contributions.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (moderate positive, influenced by P=O with amide/thioether moderation).

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.3961827232991474
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `Cl\C=C/Cl` (which is trans-1,2-dichloroethene) by analyzing trends in the data. 

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Simple alkenes and alkanes**: 
   - `CC1CCCC1` (cyclohexane derivative) has a value of -0.849.
   - `CCCC(C)C` (branched alkane) has a value of 0.614.
   - `CC1=CCCCC1` (cyclohexene derivative) has a value of 0.873.
   - `CCC=O` (butanal) has a value of 0.558.
   - `CCCC(=C)C` (branched alkene) has a value of 0.129.

   Alkenes seem to have higher values than alkanes, especially if conjugated or part of a ring.

2. **Chlorinated compounds**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of 0.675.
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (dichlorophenol) has a value of 0.591.
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline) has a value of -0.313.
   - `CCBr` (bromoethane) has a value of -0.162.
   - `CCCCBr` (bromobutane) has a value of -0.902.

   Chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive values, while chlorinated aliphatics or simple halides tend to have negative values.

3. **Small, symmetric molecules**:
   - `Cl\C=C/Cl` is a small, symmetric molecule with no aromaticity or complex functional groups. 

### Prediction for `Cl\C=C/Cl`:
- It is a small, non-aromatic chlorinated alkene. 
- From the data, simple alkenes (`CC1=CCCCC1`) have higher values, but chlorinated aliphatics (`CCBr`, `CCCCBr`) have negative values. 
- The symmetry and lack of conjugation or aromaticity suggest a modest negative value, similar to other small halides.

Given these trends, a reasonable prediction for `Cl\C=C/Cl` would be around **-0.4 to -0.6**. 

Looking at the closest analogs:
- `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline) is -0.313, but it has an aromatic ring and an amine group.
- `CCBr` is -0.162, but it's a simpler bromoalkane.
- `CCCCBr` is -0.902, but it's a longer-chain bromoalkane.

Given that `Cl\C=C/Cl` is a small, symmetric dichloroalkene, a plausible predicted value is **-0.5**.

### Final answer:
Predicted property value for `Cl\C=C/Cl`: **-0.5** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.7549975910220741
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1** (contains aromatic ring with N and O substituents): **0.74378669**
   - **COc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (aromatic ring with O and NO2 substituents): **0.90944458**
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (polycyclic aromatic with multiple N atoms): **0.07239087**
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (aromatic with multiple N atoms): **0.95957779**

   These examples suggest that aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms (especially in conjugated systems) tend to have **positive property values**, often in the range of **0.1 to 1.0**.

2. **Simple Aromatic Hydrocarbons**:
   - **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): **0.93876132**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (large polyaromatic): **-0.97254257**

   The property value seems to depend on the size and substitution of the aromatic system, with smaller or substituted aromatics often having positive values.

3. **Pyridine-Like Structures**:
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (N-containing polyaromatic): **0.07239087**
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C** (complex N/O heterocycle): **0.05902261**

   Pyridine (a 6-membered aromatic ring with one N) is simpler than these, but the presence of nitrogen in the ring seems to push the property value toward the **positive side**.

### Prediction for **c1ccncc1** (Pyridine):
- Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. Based on the examples:
  - Similar N-containing aromatics (e.g., **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**) have values around **0.07**.
  - Simpler N-aromatics (like pyridine) might have slightly higher values due to less complexity.
  - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like NO2 or halogens) are present to lower the value.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **c1ccncc1** is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.35**

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.7336180761624735
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** by analyzing structural features and trends in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, carbonyl `C=O`, amines `-NH-`, halogens like `-Cl`) tend to have negative property values, especially when multiple polar groups are present.
   - Nonpolar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains, aromatic rings without polar substituents) often correlate with positive property values.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `-NO2`, `-Cl`) tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., `-OCH3`, `-OH`) can increase the property value (less negative or positive).

3. **Hybridization and Conjugation**:
   - Conjugated systems (e.g., fused aromatic rings, extended π-systems) often have negative values, especially if combined with polar substituents.
   - Triple bonds (`C#C`) or less polar aliphatic chains can increase the property value.

4. **Specific Examples**:
   - `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (a urea derivative with two aromatic rings) has a value of **0.44575009**.
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (halogenated aromatic) has a value of **-0.8642112**.
   - `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether) has a value of **0.95841796** (nonpolar aromatic).
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (sugar-like polyol) has a value of **-0.79669956**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**  
This molecule has:
1. A polar polyol chain: `OCC(O)CO-` (similar to sugar-like structures, which are negative in the dataset).
2. An ester group: `-OC(=O)-` (polar, likely decreases property value).
3. A phenyl group attached to the ester: `c1ccccc1` (neutral unless substituted).
4. An aromatic amine bridge: `-Nc2ccnc3-` (polar, may decrease value).
5. A fused aromatic system with a chlorine substituent: `cc(Cl)ccc23` (electron-withdrawing, decreases value).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The polyol and ester groups resemble **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (-0.796) and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** (-0.911).
- The chlorine-substituted fused aromatic resembles **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (-0.864) and **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (-0.874).
- The aromatic amine resembles **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (+0.446), but here it's part of a more polar system.

### Prediction:
Given the multiple polar groups (hydroxyl, ester, amine, chlorine) and the fused aromatic system, the property value is likely **negative** and moderately large in magnitude. The closest analogs suggest a value between **-0.7 and -0.9**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.82** (estimated based on structural similarity to molecules with values around -0.8 in the dataset). 

This balances the contributions from the polyol (-0.8-like), ester (-0.9-like), and chloroaromatic (-0.87-like) components.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -1.008705375908302
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): 0.84687487  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): 0.09072654  
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (decalin): 0.6440604  
   - **C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylmethane): 0.10550295  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (heptyl iodide): 0.75762855  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): -0.85465743  

   Hydrocarbons with no polar groups tend to have positive but varying values, while halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., with Cl) tend to have negative values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups:**
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.94610363  
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): -0.82439419  
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)...** (complex ester): -1.01177221  
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): 0.46439896  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -1.01275758  

   Alcohols (**-OH**) show mixed trends:  
   - Simple alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**) have positive values (~0.46).  
   - Cyclic alcohols (e.g., **OC1CCCCCCC1**) have very negative values (~-1.01).  
   - The presence of multiple polar groups or rings seems to push values downward.

3. **Chain Length and Branching:**
   - Longer chains with no polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**) have higher positive values.  
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1**) reduces the value significantly.  

### Analysis of **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- It is a **linear alcohol** with a 5-carbon chain and a terminal **-OH** group.  
- Similar to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol, 0.464) but linear and primary.  
- No cyclic or highly polar groups to drive the value negative.  
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclic alcohol, -1.01), linearity likely avoids such extreme negativity.  
- The **-OH** group adds some polarity, but the hydrocarbon chain is long enough to offset strong negative effects.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, **CCCCCO** is expected to have a **moderately positive value**, similar to other linear alcohols or hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: ~0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where simple, linear alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**: 0.464) have values in this range, while more complex or cyclic alcohols (e.g., **OC1CCCCCCC1**: -1.01) deviate significantly.  

### Final Answer:
**0.45**

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.7504008085868655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. Benzene rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., -NH2) tend to have positive property values (e.g., Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2: 0.901), while those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) tend to have negative values (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1: -0.993). Here, the benzene ring is attached to an amide group (-N(C=O)), which is moderately electron-withdrawing.
   
2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding. In the examples, amides appear in molecules with mixed property values (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1: 0.573, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC: -0.734). The property value seems to depend on the broader context of the molecule.

3. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: Sulfonyl groups are strongly electron-withdrawing. In the examples, sulfonyl/sulfoxide groups appear in molecules with negative property values (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: 0.063, but this also has a nitro group). The sulfonyl group here is likely to contribute to a negative property value.

4. **Heterocycle (CCO1)**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocycle with oxygen and sulfur. Heterocycles with oxygen (e.g., tetrahydrofuran-like structures) often appear in negative property values (e.g., C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O: -0.797). Sulfur-containing heterocycles can vary, but the sulfonyl group's influence dominates here.

5. **Overall Polarity and Functional Groups**: The molecule has a mix of polar (amide, sulfonyl) and aromatic components. The sulfonyl and amide groups are likely to dominate, suggesting a negative property value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2**: Highly positive (0.901) due to electron-donating -NH2 groups.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Highly negative (-0.993) due to electron-withdrawing Cl groups.
- **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: Moderately positive (0.573) due to the amide and fluorine (less electron-withdrawing than sulfonyl).
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Slightly positive (0.063) due to competing effects of sulfonyl and nitro groups.

Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonyl group and the amide, the property value is likely negative but not as extreme as fully halogenated aromatics. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.45**. This accounts for the sulfonyl group's strong electron-withdrawing effect and the balancing influence of the aromatic ring and amide.

### Final Answer:
**-0.45**

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.9203394808670405
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular characteristics such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES**: `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`), which is aromatic and often associated with negative property values in the examples (e.g., `c1ccccc1` derivatives tend to have negative values unless balanced by other features).
   - The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to the benzene ring is electron-withdrawing and may decrease the property value further (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.18778833`).

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Two ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`) are present. Esters can contribute positively to the property (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC` has `-0.4928373`, but this is less negative due to the ester).
   - An enamine-like structure (`C1=C(C)NC=`) with a nitrogen in a conjugated system may add some positive contribution (e.g., `c2ccc1NCCc1c2` has `0.95946331`).

3. **Substituents and Sterics**:
   - The molecule has bulky substituents (methyl groups and aromatic rings), which can influence the property. For example, `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has `-0.11022647`, while more complex structures with esters and nitro groups can shift this.

4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest examples are molecules with nitro groups and esters, such as `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (`-0.18778833`) and `CCCCC(=O)OC` (`-0.4928373`). However, the presence of two esters and additional conjugation may pull the value closer to neutral or slightly positive.
   - The aromatic nitro group is a significant negative contributor, but the esters and conjugated system may offset this.

### Predicted Property Value:
Balancing the negative contribution of the nitro-aromatic system with the positive contributions of the esters and conjugated enamine, the predicted property value is approximately:  
**`0.12345678`**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on the examples and structural trends. The actual value may vary slightly depending on finer details of the molecular interactions.)  

---  
**Final Answer**: `0.123` (rounded to 3 decimal places for consistency with the examples).

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.08230425997930345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure with a fused cyclopropane ring.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - Amides are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as acceptors). 
   - The cyclopropane ring introduces strain but does not significantly alter polarity.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, carbonyls) tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **0.56632975**). 
   - Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** has **0.64116369**) also fall in this range.
   - The lack of aromaticity or extended conjugation in this molecule suggests a lower value than highly conjugated systems (e.g., **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has **0.95897867**).

4. **Unique Features**:
   - The cyclopropane ring adds rigidity but no strong electronic effects. 
   - The imide group (two amides in a ring) is more polar than a single amide but less than highly halogenated or aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polarity (from the imide) and the neutral effect of the cyclopropane ring, the property value is likely in the **0.5 to 0.7 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.62** (approximate, based on structural similarity to mid-range polar cyclic molecules in the examples). 

This aligns with the trend where cyclic polar structures (e.g., imides, amides) without strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups or conjugation fall in this range.
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.9533094162647784
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Simple alkanes/alkenes** (e.g., `CCCCC` = -0.849, `C1CC=CC1` = 0.828, `CCC1CCCCC1` = -0.960) show that branching and unsaturation can significantly affect the property (more unsaturated/cyclic tends to increase the value).

2. **Chlorinated compounds**:
   - `Clc1ccccc1` (chlorobenzene) = -0.023
   - `Clc1ccccc1I` (iodochlorobenzene) = -0.864
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (pentachlorobenzene) = 0.715
   - `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` (hexachlorocyclopentadiene) = 0.895  
   Chlorination tends to increase the property value with more chlorines, but small chlorinated aliphatics (like `ClCC`) are not directly represented.

3. **Small chlorinated aliphatic**: The closest example is `CC#N` (acetonitrile) = 0.155, but this is not chlorinated. `ClCC` (chloroethane) is simpler and less polarizable than most chlorinated aromatics, so its value should be lower than chlorobenzene (-0.023) but higher than very nonpolar alkanes (e.g., `CCCCC` = -0.849).

4. **Hybrid approach**: `ClCC` is a small, weakly polar molecule with one chlorine. Its property value likely lies between the smallest chlorinated aromatic (`Clc1ccccc1` = -0.023) and simple alkanes (~-0.8 to -0.9). A reasonable interpolation suggests a value closer to the lower end due to lack of conjugation/aromaticity.

### Predicted property for `ClCC`: **-0.45**  
(Approximate, based on interpolation between chlorobenzene and simple alkanes, accounting for its small size and lack of aromaticity.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.8330392006857131
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br, I) molecules**:
   - **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl** (many Cl atoms): **0.95167883** (high positive value).
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl**: **-1.01995439** (very negative, but note the presence of NO2).
   - **BrC(Cl)Cl**: **-0.99485902** (very negative, small molecule with Br and Cl).
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: **0.957706** (high positive, multiple Cl atoms on aromatic rings).

2. **Aromatic systems with halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: **-0.93527643** (negative, two aromatic rings with Cl).
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: **0.66698711** (positive, Br on aromatic system).

3. **Presence of nitrogen in aromatic systems**:
   - **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**: **0.31500542** (positive, nitrogen in aromatic ring).
   - **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**: **0.60113807** (positive, nitrogen in aromatic ring).

4. **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl group)**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: **0.93322636** (high positive, trichloromethyl group present).
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: **-0.19243033** (slightly negative, but note the additional aromatic systems).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**
- The molecule consists of:
  - A chlorinated aromatic ring (**Clc1cccc(n1)**).
  - A nitrogen in the aromatic ring (pyridine-like structure).
  - A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) group attached to the aromatic ring.
- From the examples:
  - The trichloromethyl group tends to correlate with high positive values (e.g., **0.93322636**, **0.957706**).
  - Nitrogen in the aromatic ring can contribute to positive values (e.g., **0.31500542**, **0.60113807**).
  - However, if the molecule is small and highly halogenated (like **BrC(Cl)Cl**), it can be very negative, but this is not the case here due to the aromatic system.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the trichloromethyl group and the nitrogen in the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be **positive and relatively high**, similar to other molecules with these features. 

Comparing to **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (0.957706) and **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (0.93322636), the value should be in a similar range. The nitrogen in the ring may slightly reduce the value compared to purely chlorinated systems, but the trichloromethyl group dominates.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.85** (estimated based on structural similarity to high-positive examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-hexanol): Property value = **-0.47220656**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **0.77946975**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.06926531**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.06926531**

   The property values for alcohols vary depending on the structure:
   - Aliphatic alcohols without aromatic rings tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.47 for 3-hexanol).
   - Aromatic alcohols (e.g., 1-phenylethanol) have positive values.
   - Branched aliphatic alcohols (e.g., 2-methyl-1-pentanol) have less negative values (~-0.07).

2. **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol):
   - This is a branched aliphatic alcohol, similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) and **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol), which both have a property value of **-0.06926531**.
   - The branching in 2-hexanol is similar to these examples, so it is reasonable to expect a comparable property value.

### Additional Considerations:
- The presence of branching in aliphatic alcohols seems to reduce the magnitude of the negative property value (e.g., -0.47 for linear 3-hexanol vs. -0.07 for branched 2-methyl-1-pentanol).
- The property value is likely influenced by factors such as hydrophobicity, polarity, and steric effects, with branching reducing hydrophobicity and thus increasing the property value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity of **CCCCC(C)O** to **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**, the predicted property value is:

**-0.06926531** (same as the branched alcohol examples). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is **-0.06926531**.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.33475148379997194
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Halogen Substituents**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (two aromatic rings with Cl substituents): **-0.20267289**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (single aromatic ring with two Cl substituents): **0.59120862** (same as **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**, suggesting hydroxyl group doesn't significantly alter the property in this case)
   - **O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1** (aromatic with Cl and nitro group): **-0.67373332**
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (multiple Cl-substituted aromatics): **-0.56411522**

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) generally contribute to lower property values when present in bulk or with electron-withdrawing effects, but Br is larger and more polarizable than Cl, which may slightly increase the property value compared to Cl analogues.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is a para-disubstituted benzene with Br, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (which has a value of **0.59120862**). However, Br is less electronegative than Cl but more polarizable, which could lead to a slightly higher value.

4. **Other Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (fully chlorinated alkane): **0.94519591** (high value, likely due to high halogen content)
   - **CI** (iodomethane): **-0.60013562** (shows that heavier halogens can have varying effects).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1:
- The closest analogue is **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a value of **0.59120862**.
- Replacing Cl with Br (less electronegative but more polarizable) might slightly increase the property value due to increased polarizability.
- However, Br is also larger and may introduce steric effects that could slightly lower the value compared to Cl.

Given these competing effects, the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely **similar to or slightly higher than the Cl analogue**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.60** (rounded from ~0.59-0.62 range based on Br vs. Cl trends). 

For specificity, we can approximate it as **0.602**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.602**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., the second example with multiple Cl substitutions has a value of **0.94240591**).
2. The given molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** with **7 chlorine atoms**, similar to the second example in the dataset (which has 10 Cl atoms and a value of **0.94240591**).
3. The **symmetry and degree of chlorination** seem to correlate with higher positive values. This molecule is less chlorinated than the second example but still heavily substituted.

### Comparison:
- The second example:  
  **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (10 Cl atoms) → **0.94240591**  
- The new molecule:  
  **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** (7 Cl atoms) → Expected to be **slightly lower** due to fewer Cl atoms but still strongly positive.

### Predicted Value:
Given the trend, a reasonable estimate for this molecule would be:  
**~0.85** (slightly lower than the second example due to reduced chlorination but still high due to aromaticity and symmetry).  

### Final Answer:
**0.85** (approximate prediction based on structural similarity and chlorination trends).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 0.9547506898527025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring), which are common in the examples. Aromaticity alone doesn't consistently correlate with a specific property trend, but substitution patterns matter.
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...))**: This is a polar, negatively charged (or ionizable) group. In the examples, polar/charged groups often correlate with negative property values (e.g., `-0.70662472` for a molecule with a carboxylate-like group, `-0.9153154` for a thiophosphate group).
3. **Alkyl substitutions (methyl groups)**: The molecule has multiple methyl groups (e.g., `Cc1...`, `C)c2...`, `C)cc1`). Alkyl groups can increase hydrophobicity, but their effect depends on context. In the examples, simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCC`) have positive values, but when combined with polar groups, the property tends to be negative.
4. **Bulkiness**: The molecule is large and bulky due to the phosphate linker and multiple aromatic rings. Bulky molecules with polar groups in the examples often have negative property values (e.g., `-0.77792787` for a steroid-like molecule).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog in the examples is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = `-0.9153154`), which has a thiophosphate group and aromatic rings. The given molecule also has a phosphate group and aromatic rings, suggesting a similar negative value.
- Another similar example is **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = `0.65619515`), but this lacks a phosphate group and has a very different substitution pattern. The phosphate group in the given molecule likely dominates the property.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings with alkyl substitutions (but no strong electron-withdrawing groups) is seen in **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property = `0.58767589`), but again, the phosphate group here changes the trend.

### Prediction:
Given the phosphate group's strong influence (similar to the thiophosphate example with a negative value) and the bulky aromatic structure, I predict a **negative property value** for this molecule. The exact value is likely between `-0.5` and `-0.9`, based on the examples.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.712** (a balance between the phosphate group's negative contribution and the aromatic/alkyl contributions). 

This is an estimate based on the structural analogy to the provided examples.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.9424218534880285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: The presence of **CF3** is often associated with moderate to high polarity and electron-withdrawing effects. In the examples, molecules with **CF3** (e.g., **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl**) tend to have positive property values (~0.39). However, other electronegative groups can counteract this.

2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The **CF3** is attached to a benzene ring, which is further substituted with a complex heterocyclic group (**N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**). This heterocycle includes:
   - A **ketone (=O)** (electron-withdrawing, may reduce the property value).
   - Two **chlorine atoms (Cl)** (electron-withdrawing, often associated with negative values, e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** has -0.864).
   - A **tertiary amine (N2)** (can slightly increase the property value if not heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups).

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a property value of **-0.606**, featuring a nitro group (strong electron-withdrawing) and chlorine on an aromatic ring.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has **-1.015**, due to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group and amine.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C** has **0.912**, where the **CF3** and sulfonamide contribute to a high value, but the **amide (=O)** and methyl groups balance it.

### Prediction:
The molecule has competing effects:
- **Electron-withdrawing groups (CF3, Cl, =O)** would typically reduce the property value (negative contribution).
- The **tertiary amine (N2)** and aromaticity might slightly increase it.
- The overall structure is more similar to **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.606)** but with additional complexity (CF3 and heterocycle).

Given these observations, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely low**, similar to other chlorine- and ketone-containing molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9094445833591833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tend to have positive property values. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **0.49846937**
     - `Cc1cccc(C)c1N(=O)=O` (hypothetical, not in examples but similar to given structures) would likely have a positive value.
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and often increases the property value.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - Methoxy groups on aromatic rings (e.g., `COc1ccccc1`) are moderately electron-donating. In the examples:
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` → **-0.91274862** (this has two ester groups, which are strongly electron-withdrawing, so the methoxy's effect is overshadowed).
     - `COc1ccccc1` (not in examples, but analogous to `c1ccccc1O` → **-0.22181889**) would likely have a slightly positive or neutral effect compared to phenol.

3. **Combined Substituents**:
   - The molecule `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has both a methoxy group (electron-donating) and a nitro group (electron-withdrawing) on the same aromatic ring. The nitro group's effect is typically stronger, so we expect a positive property value but not as high as a molecule with two nitro groups (like `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **0.49846937**).

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` → **0.3030691** (has an aromatic ether and other groups).
   - `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → **0.8330392** (halogenated aromatic with strong electron-withdrawing effects).
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **0.49846937** (two nitro groups).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The nitro group alone (on an aromatic ring) contributes ~0.4–0.5.
- The methoxy group may slightly reduce this effect (but not enough to make the value negative).

A reasonable estimate for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** would be slightly lower than **0.49846937** (the dinitro example) but still positive. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.35** (likely between 0.3 and 0.4). 

Looking at the examples, the closest analogies suggest a value around **0.35**. For instance:
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` → **0.3030691** (similar ether + electron-withdrawing group).
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **0.49846937** (stronger electron-withdrawing effect).

Thus, the final predicted value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is:

**0.35** (approximate, likely in the range 0.3–0.4). 

If forced to pick a specific value from the given examples' trends, **0.35** is a reasonable interpolation. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on correlating structural features with the given numerical trends.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.7977527738475468
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations from the Given Molecule:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule contains **8 chlorine atoms** attached to a polycyclic framework (likely a bridged or cage-like structure, e.g., a chlorinated derivative of adamantane or similar).  
2. **Polarity and Electronegativity**: The high number of Cl atoms introduces significant polarity and electron-withdrawing effects.  
3. **Steric Hindrance**: The bulky Cl substituents may influence the property by increasing molecular rigidity or steric crowding.  

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (Hexachlorocyclohexane)**: Property = **0.43856322**.  
  This molecule is also highly chlorinated (6 Cl atoms) and cyclic, yielding a moderately positive property value.  
- **ClCCCl (1,2-Dichloroethane)**: Property = **0.25903478**.  
  Fewer Cl atoms but still polar, with a lower value than hexachlorocyclohexane.  
- **BrC(Br)Br (Bromoform)**: Property = **0.67428076**.  
  A trihalogenated molecule with high polarity, suggesting that heavy halogenation tends to increase the property value.  

### Trends:
- More halogen atoms (Cl/Br) → Higher property value (positive correlation).  
- Cyclic/bridged structures with halogens → Moderate to high values (e.g., 0.4–0.9 range).  
- The given molecule has **more Cl atoms (8)** than any example, but the steric constraints of the cage-like structure might temper the increase.  

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and rigid polycyclic framework, the property value should be **higher than hexachlorocyclohexane (0.438)** but likely less than bromoform (0.674) due to steric saturation. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.55 ± 0.05**

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.40821027218784955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, 0.13719208)**: Esters tend to have moderate positive values (around 0.1 to 0.6).
   - **Ethers (e.g., COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)..., -0.55733553)**: Ethers often have negative values, but this depends on other substituents.
   - **Carbonyls (C=O)**: Alone, they may not dominate the property, but in esters, they contribute to moderate values.
   - **Alkyl Chains (e.g., C1CCCCCC1, 0.41078563)**: Longer alkyl chains tend to increase the property value slightly.

2. **Polarity and Electronegativity**:
   - Molecules with highly electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂) often have negative values unless balanced by other features (e.g., alkyl groups).
   - Simple esters like **CCCOC=O** lack strongly electronegative substituents, so the value is likely positive.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2, 0.65973585**: This is a more complex ester with additional ether and aromatic groups, but the ester moiety contributes to a positive value.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, 0.13719208**: A simpler ester with an aromatic ring and amine substituent, still positive but lower due to the amine.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
- **Structure**: Propyl formate is a simple aliphatic ester with a 3-carbon chain and a formyl group (C=O).
- **Expected Property**: Given the trends, simple esters with no strongly electronegative substituents tend to have moderate positive values. The lack of aromaticity or other polar groups suggests a value lower than complex esters but higher than very simple hydrocarbons.

### Estimated Value:
Based on the examples, I predict the property value for **CCCOC=O** to be approximately **0.25**. This is between the values for simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCCCCC1, 0.41) and more polar esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, 0.137).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCOC=O: 0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.14692128525478226
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, **-0.61798488**) tend to have negative values, indicating lower polarity or higher hydrophobicity.
   - Shorter chains or polar groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**, **-0.82513302**) can also have negative values, but highly polar or conjugated systems may have positive values.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**, **0.20801303**) often have positive values, especially if conjugated or aromatic.
   - Alcohols (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**, **-0.82513302**) can have negative values unless they are part of a more complex polar system.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Pure aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32**, **-0.96947585**) have strongly negative values.
   - Aromatics with polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**, **0.56947632**) can have positive values.

4. **Halogens**:
   - Halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br**, **-0.66528222**) can vary but often have negative values unless combined with other polar groups.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (CC(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrophobic chain suggests a tendency toward negative values (like **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, **-0.61798488**).
- However, the ester group is polar and could offset this slightly, pulling the value toward less negative or even positive (like **COCC(=O)N...**, **0.20801303**).

### Balancing Factors:
- The long hydrophobic chain dominates, but the ester adds some polarity.
- Similar molecules with long chains + polar groups (e.g., **CCCCC(CC)C=O**, **0.38169701**) have positive values, but this is an aldehyde, which is more polar than an ester.
- Esters with shorter chains (e.g., **CCOC(=O)CCN...**, **-0.74597728**) are negative, but this is a more complex molecule.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the long hydrophobic chain and the moderate polarity of the ester, the property value is likely **slightly negative but closer to zero** than pure hydrocarbons. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: -0.25**  

This balances the hydrophobic effect of the long chain with the polar contribution of the ester.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.851516557970701
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings, one with a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine (Cl), and the other with two chlorines and a nitro group (NO2). These are polar and electronegative substituents, which can influence the property.
   - Example: **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has a value of **0.30678442**. This molecule has multiple Cl and O substitutions, similar to our target molecule but lacks the NO2 and amide (C=O)N groups.
   - Example: **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.6063454**. This is a simpler nitro-chlorobenzene, and the nitro group seems to pull the value down.

2. **Amide linker (C(=O)N)**: This is a polar group that can hydrogen bond and may increase the property value.
   - Example: **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** has a value of **0.89417659**, suggesting amides can contribute positively.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is strongly electron-withdrawing and may decrease the property value, as seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.6063454)**.

4. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: This is polar and can hydrogen bond, often increasing the property value.
   - Example: **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has a value of **0.94747506**, showing OH can contribute positively.

### Combining Effects:
- The hydroxyl and amide groups would push the value up.
- The nitro group and multiple chlorines would pull the value down.
- The molecule is more complex than most examples, but it resembles a combination of **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (0.30678442)** and **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.6063454)**, with an added amide linker.

Given the competing effects, the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature might dominate slightly, but the amide and hydroxyl groups will offset this. The value is likely in the low-to-mid positive range.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.25**. This balances the positive contributions of the OH and amide with the negative contribution of the NO2 and Cl groups.

**Final answer: 0.25**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.5272377792297679
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features:

1. **Electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., Cl, NO₂, C=O, S=O, P=O/S) tend to **decrease** the property value (more negative).
2. **Aromatic systems** (e.g., benzene rings) **increase** the property value (more positive), especially if unsubstituted or with electron-donating groups.
3. **Aliphatic chains** (e.g., CCCC) **increase** the property value slightly unless polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O) are present.
4. **Sulfur-containing groups** (e.g., thioethers, thiophenes) can **increase** the property value (e.g., `CCSSCC` has a positive value).
5. **Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., OH, NH) **decrease** the property value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

1. **Structural Features**:
   - Two **P(=S)(OC) groups**: Strongly electron-withdrawing (similar to phosphorothioates in the examples, which are associated with positive values when balanced with other groups).
   - Two **aromatic rings** (electron-rich due to O- and S-linkages).
   - **Thioether linkage (S)**: Likely increases the property value (as seen with `CCSSCC` = 0.417, `Sc2ccc...` in other examples).
   - No strongly polar groups (e.g., OH, NH) to pull the value down.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **0.8379376**), which has:
     - P(=S)(OC) group (positive contribution).
     - Aromatic ring with Cl (slightly negative, but outweighed by P/S).
     - Thioether-like linkage (SCC).
   - Another similar case is `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = **0.67449076**), where multiple Cl atoms (electron-withdrawing) are offset by aromaticity.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The target molecule has **two P(=S)(OC) groups** (strong positive contribution) and **two aromatic rings linked by S** (positive contribution). No strongly negative groups are present.
   - The value will likely be **higher than 0.8379376** (from the single P(=S) example) but less than **0.957706** (seen for a highly aromatic/chlorinated system).
   - The symmetric structure with dual P(=S) and S-linkages suggests additive positive effects.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.89**  
*(Rationale: Slightly higher than 0.8379376 due to dual P(=S) and aromatic-thioether motifs, but below 0.95 due to lack of extreme electron-donating/withdrawing balance.)*

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7559528252839682
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
     - In **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, the property is **-0.18778833**.
     - In **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**, the property is **-0.41965214** (but this also has two Cl atoms, which may lower the value further).
   - **Hydroxy group (OH)**:
     - In **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**, the property is **-0.10633924**.
     - In **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, the property is **0.56947632** (but this has multiple Cl atoms, which may complicate the trend).
   - **Combination of OH and NO2**:
     - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has both an OH and a NO2 group on the benzene ring. This is somewhat similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (OH and amide) and **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (NO2 and methyl), but not identical.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl) tend to have negative property values, while those with electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH2) can have less negative or positive values. The combination of OH (electron-donating) and NO2 (electron-withdrawing) may partially cancel each other's effects.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a NO2 group and an O-linker with Cl substituents, giving **-0.41965214**.
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has an OH and an amide, giving **-0.10633924**.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a NO2 and a methyl, giving **-0.18778833**.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has an OH (electron-donating) and a NO2 (electron-withdrawing) on the benzene ring. The OH is likely to slightly counteract the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the NO2, but the NO2 is still dominant. 

Given the examples:
- The NO2 group alone (with a methyl) gives **-0.18778833**.
- The OH group (with an amide) gives **-0.10633924**.
- The combination of OH and NO2 is likely to result in a value between these two, but closer to the NO2-dominated case because NO2 is a stronger influence.

Thus, a reasonable prediction is slightly more negative than **-0.18778833** but less negative than **-0.41965214** (which has additional Cl atoms). 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.25**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. If the property is something like "logP" or "dipole moment," the reasoning might differ.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.9257652153360341
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (a sugar derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages, which are highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding.

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `-0.79669956`).
- The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) or aromatic rings can influence the value, but the dominant factor here is the high polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity of the sugar.

The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is even more polar and hydrogen-bonding than the simpler sugar example (`C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`), so its property value should be more negative. 

Given this reasoning, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately **-1.1**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.4747327741267967
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene), which has a property value of **0.03269372**. This suggests that triple bonds (alkynes) may contribute to a slightly positive property value, but the presence of other functional groups (like nitriles) complicates the interpretation.

2. **Hydrocarbons**:
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (hexamethylbenzene): **0.91680757** (highly positive, likely due to aromaticity and methyl groups).
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptan-4-ol): **-0.47220656** (negative, likely due to the hydroxyl group).
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (hexadecanol): **-0.19228569** (less negative than heptan-4-ol, possibly due to long alkyl chain dominating over the -OH).
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (pentan-2-one): **-0.33130637** (negative, likely due to the carbonyl group).
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (3-methylbutan-2-one): **0.94079101** (unexpectedly high; branching or sterics may play a role).
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal): **0.66730339** (positive, despite the carbonyl; long alkyl chain may dominate).

3. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**:
   - No simple alkanes or alkenes are present in the examples, but **CCCC** (butane) would likely have a low or slightly negative value based on trends.
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne) is a simple alkyne with no other functional groups. Comparing to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**, the property value is likely small and positive, but less than the nitrile example due to the absence of aromaticity or electronegative atoms.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- The triple bond introduces some polarity, but the molecule is otherwise nonpolar with no aromaticity or other functional groups.
- The closest analog is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**, but **CCC#C** lacks the aromatic ring and nitriles, so its value should be smaller in magnitude.
- Given the examples, I predict a **small positive value**, likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.15** (a reasonable estimate based on the limited examples and the alkyne's intermediate polarity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given data.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.8547596951846422
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in the molecule, which is also seen in:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property: **0.8379376**)
   - `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` (property: **-1.01655863**)
   The first example has a positive value, while the second is highly negative. The difference lies in the rest of the structure (e.g., aromatic Cl substitution vs. aliphatic chains).

2. **Aromatic ring with multiple Cl substitutions**: 
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property: **0.67449076**)
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property: **0.67449076**)
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (property: **0.957706**)
   These show that heavily chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive property values (~0.6–0.95).

3. **Ethoxy (CCO-) and thioethoxy (CCS-) groups**:
   - `CCSCC` (property: **0.6964744**)
   - `CCCCOCCCC` (property: **0.932254**)
   Aliphatic ether/thioether chains often contribute to positive values.

4. **Combination of P=S and chlorinated aromatic**:
   The molecule resembles `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property: **0.8379376**), but with simpler substituents (ethoxy instead of a complex carbamate). The chlorinated aromatic part is similar to the examples with values ~0.6–0.95.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S),
- A heavily chlorinated aromatic ring (3 Cl substituents),
- Ethoxy/alkyl linkages (which generally align with positive values in the examples),

the property value is likely **between 0.8 and 0.95**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.87**, close to the similar phosphorothioate example (0.8379376) but slightly higher due to the simpler, more hydrophobic structure.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.87** (approximate, likely in the range 0.85–0.90).

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.6011380670390772
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring (`c1nccc...c1`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide or hydrazone-like group).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic nitrogen (in the pyridine ring).
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`) directly attached to the ring.
   - A hydrazine-like group (`NN`), which is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of the `C(=O)NN` group suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which often correlates with lower (more negative) property values in the given examples.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with aromatic nitrogen and polar substituents (e.g., `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` with property `-0.67408557`) are particularly relevant. This example has a similar combination of aromatic nitrogen and polar groups (amide-like).
- The `C(=O)NN` group is even more polar than a simple amide, likely pushing the property further negative.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability of `C(=O)NN`, the property value is likely more negative than `-0.67408557` (from the similar example above) but less extreme than very negative values like `-1.01550189` (seen for highly polar/nitro-substituted aromatics). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **`-0.75`**.

### Final Answer:
Predicted property value for `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`: **`-0.75`** (approximate).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.12281157661118784
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** by analyzing structural features and trends from the provided examples.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with highly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro `N(=O)=O`, sulfonyl `S=O`, carboxyl `C(=O)O`, or phosphate `P(=S)(OC)OC`) tend to have lower (often negative) property values. Examples:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (-0.977)
     - `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-1.015)
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` (-0.037)
   - Less polar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains, halogens, aromatic rings) often correlate with higher (positive) values. Examples:
     - `CC1=CCCCC1` (0.872)
     - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (0.958)

2. **Molecular Size/Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., polycyclic aromatics or steroids) can have either high or low values depending on functional groups. Examples:
     - `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` (0.894) – high due to halogens and rigidity.
     - `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (0.745) – moderate due to carbonyl and hydroxyl.

3. **Phosphorothioate Group (`P(=S)(OR)OR`)**:
   - The example `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` has a value of **-0.037**, suggesting that the `P(=S)` group contributes to a lower value, especially when combined with other polar groups (e.g., nitro).

4. **Amide Group (`C(=O)N`)**:
   - Amides often lower the property value (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` at -0.977).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** contains:
- A **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCCC)SCC`), similar to the example with `P(=S)` (-0.037).
- An **amide group** (`C(=O)N`), which is strongly negative in other examples.
- **Alkyl chains** (`CCC`, `CCCCC`), which would push the value higher.
- No strongly polarizing groups like nitro or carboxylates.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both the phosphorothioate (moderately negative influence) and the amide (strongly negative influence), but balanced by alkyl chains, the property value is likely **negative but not extreme**. 

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` (-0.037) has `P(=S)` + nitro, giving a slightly negative value.
- `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (-0.977) is very negative due to two amides.
- The target has one `P(=S)` and one amide, but no nitro, so it should be more negative than -0.037 but less than -0.977.

A reasonable estimate is **~ -0.4 to -0.6**. 

Looking for closer analogs:
- `CCOC(=O)N` is -0.415 (ester + amide).
- The target is similar but with `P(=S)` and longer chains, so slightly more negative.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.55** (approximate, likely between -0.5 and -0.6). 

This balances the negative contributions of `P(=S)` and `C(=O)N` with the positive contributions of the alkyl chains.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.6440604016827128
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)**:
   - `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclohexane): -0.261
   - `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol): -0.482
   - `CCCC/C=C/C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon): 0.273
   - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (alkylcyclohexane): -0.300
   - `CCCCCCCC` (octane) is a fully saturated linear hydrocarbon, similar to the above but with no functional groups or rings.

2. **Trends**:
   - Saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) tend to have negative property values (e.g., cyclohexane: -0.261, alkylcyclohexane: -0.300).
   - The property value becomes less negative as the chain length increases (e.g., `CCCCCCCO` is -0.482 vs. `CCC(O)CC` is -1.007).
   - Unsaturation (double bonds) increases the property value (e.g., `CCCC/C=C/C` is 0.273).

3. **Prediction for `CCCCCCCC` (octane)**:
   - It is a saturated linear hydrocarbon with no functional groups or rings.
   - Compared to `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (alkylcyclohexane, -0.300), octane is fully linear and should have a slightly more negative value (due to lack of ring strain or branching effects).
   - Compared to `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol, -0.482), octane lacks the polar -OH group, which likely contributes to the less negative value of heptanol.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC` (octane) is approximately **-0.35**. 

This is slightly more negative than cyclohexane (-0.261) due to the lack of ring structure and slightly less negative than alkylcyclohexane (-0.300) due to the linearity. 

**Final answer: -0.35** (estimated based on trends).

Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.9251814145930342
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, halogens), aromaticity, and overall molecular complexity. The property tends to be more positive for molecules with aromatic rings, carbonyl groups, or less halogenation, and more negative for highly halogenated or aliphatic cyclic structures without polar groups.

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

1. **Structural features**:  
   - Contains multiple fused rings (steroid-like structure).  
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`-OH`).  
   - One carbonyl group (`C=O`).  
   - One alkyne group (`C#C`).  
   - No halogens or highly electronegative substituents.  

2. **Comparison with similar examples**:  
   - **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property: **-0.91832769**): Similar fused-ring structure with one carbonyl and one hydroxyl group, but no alkyne. The property is negative.  
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property: **-0.13731413**): More polar groups (two hydroxyls, one carbonyl, one fluorine) lead to a less negative value.  
   - **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **-0.76346794**): Two carbonyls and one hydroxyl, but still negative.  

3. **Key differences in the new molecule**:  
   - Additional alkyne group (`C#C`), which is moderately polarizable but not strongly electronegative.  
   - Two hydroxyl groups and one carbonyl, similar to some negative examples, but the alkyne might slightly increase the property.  

4. **Prediction**:  
   The molecule is structurally similar to those with negative property values, but the alkyne group could offset this slightly. Given the trends, I predict a **moderately negative value**, likely between **-0.5 and -0.8**.  

**Final predicted property value: -0.65**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

True Property: -0.5573355335225991
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the diverse range of properties observed in the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given data to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: 
   - Examples with similar groups (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -OH and -Cl, property = -0.927; `COc1ccccc1Cl` has -OCH₃ and -Cl, property = 0.034) suggest that methoxy groups may increase the property value compared to hydroxyl groups.
2. **Multiple oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., furan-like rings, cyclic ethers)**:
   - Example `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` (property = 0.315) has a fused oxazole, which is somewhat similar to parts of this molecule.
3. **Lactone or cyclic ester (COC2=O)**:
   - Example `CCCCCCC(=O)C` (property = 0.947) has a ketone, but this is part of a larger cyclic system here.
4. **Polycyclic framework**:
   - Examples like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property = -0.972) and `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` (property = -0.586) are polyaromatic hydrocarbons with negative values, but this molecule is more oxygenated.
5. **Glycosidic or sugar-like moieties (OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)**:
   - No direct examples, but oxygen-rich aliphatic systems like `CCCCOCCO` (property = 0.868) suggest positive contributions.

### Observations from Examples:
- Oxygenated aromatic systems with -OH tend to have negative values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.927, `OCc1ccccc1` = -1.016).
- Methoxy groups seem to raise the value (e.g., `COc1ccccc1Cl` = 0.034 vs. `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.927).
- Polycyclic systems with heteroatoms can vary widely, but oxygen-rich systems like this one may lean positive due to the methoxy and ether contributions.

### Synthesis of Features:
The molecule has:
- Multiple methoxy groups (positive contribution).
- Hydroxyl groups (negative contribution, but less dominant due to methoxy).
- Fused oxygenated rings (likely positive, similar to `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` = 0.315).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, SO₂) that would push the value higher.

### Predicted Property:
Balancing these effects, the property value is likely **moderately positive**, similar to other oxygen-rich polycyclic systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.42**  

This is based on:
- Dominance of methoxy over hydroxyl (raising the value).
- Oxygenated polycyclic framework (similar to examples ~0.3–0.6).
- Lack of strongly negative contributions (e.g., no unsubstituted polyaromatics). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.9272126039249934
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -0.75595283  
   - **Oc1ccccc1I**: Not directly given, but **Clc1ccccc1I** is -0.8642112.  
   - Phenol with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., NO₂, I, Cl) tends to have negative property values (~ -0.7 to -0.8).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**: 
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: -0.8642112  
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**: -0.20267289  
   - Monosubstituted chlorobenzene (e.g., **ClC=C**) has -0.37484199, while polychlorinated aromatics vary widely.

3. **Hydroxy + Chloro Substitution**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is a chlorophenol, analogous to the nitrophenol (**Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) but with Cl instead of NO₂.  
   - Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂, so the property value should be less negative than -0.75595283 but more negative than plain phenol (not given, but likely less negative than -0.7).

4. **Similar Structures**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -0.75595283  
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: -0.8642112  
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**: -0.20267289  
   - The property seems to depend on the electron-withdrawing strength and substitution pattern.

### Prediction:
For **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), the property value is likely between the nitrophenol (-0.75595283) and the less electron-withdrawing polychlorinated biphenyl (-0.20267289). A reasonable estimate is slightly less negative than nitrophenol due to Cl being less withdrawing than NO₂.

**Predicted Property Value: -0.68**

1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` in the examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (similar to `NC(=O)` in some examples).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly present in the examples, but alkynes are generally hydrophobic).
   - **Chlorinated alkyl chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` or `ClC1C(Cl)...` in the examples).
   - **Ether linkage**: `COC` (present in some examples like `COC(=O)...`).

2. **Polarity and Hydrophobicity**:
   - The molecule has polar groups (amide, ether) and hydrophobic groups (aromatic ring, alkyne, chlorinated alkyl). The balance suggests moderate polarity.
   - Chlorine substitutions on the aromatic ring and alkyl chain tend to increase the property value (as seen in examples like `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` with 0.95897867 or `CCCCl` with 0.95464675).
   - The amide and ether groups may slightly reduce the property value (as seen in `COC(=O)...` or `NC(=O)...` examples with lower values).

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (0.95897867): Chlorinated aromatic + hydrophobic fused ring.
   - `CCCCl` (0.95464675): Chlorinated alkyl chain.
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (0.94242185): Chlorinated + amide + aromatic.
   - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (-0.91274862): Ether + ester (more polar than our molecule).

Our molecule is less polar than `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` but more polar than `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` or `CCCCl`. The alkyne adds hydrophobicity, while the amide and ether add polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of features, I estimate the property value to be **~0.75**. This is slightly lower than highly chlorinated hydrophobic examples (e.g., ~0.95) but higher than more polar examples (e.g., ~-0.5 to 0.5).

### Final Answer:
**0.75** (approximate prediction based on structural similarity and trends in the given data).

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.6970498120337162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a heterocycle with nitrogen),
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (both with **Cl** substitution, which is electron-withdrawing).
   - A polar **OH** group (can donate hydrogen bonds).
   - A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**, likely polar and capable of hydrogen bonding).
   - Overall, the molecule is polar and has multiple sites for intermolecular interactions.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Polar/Aromatic Molecules with Cl**: 
  - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** has a property of **-0.99291022** (highly negative, likely due to Cl substitution and lack of other polar groups).
  - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has **-0.19243033** (less negative due to more Cl and steric bulk).
  - **ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** has **0.89322002** (positive, possibly due to extended conjugation and Cl substitution).

- **OH-Containing Molecules**:
  - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has **-0.82513302** (negative due to H-bonding).
  - **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **-0.79669956** (negative due to multiple OH groups).

- **Heterocycles**:
  - **Nc1nc[nH]n1** has **-0.99583549** (very negative, likely due to H-bonding and polarity).
  - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** has **-0.55796546** (less negative due to less H-bonding capacity).

### Prediction:
The given molecule combines:
1. Two **Cl-substituted phenyl rings** (electron-withdrawing, similar to some negative examples).
2. A **pyrimidine-like ring** (polar, likely negative contribution).
3. An **OH group** (H-bond donor, negative contribution).
4. However, the extended conjugation and multiple aromatic systems might offset some negativity (as seen in **ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**, which is positive).

Given the balance of these effects, the property is likely **moderately negative**, similar to molecules like **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** or **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**, but less extreme due to the additional aromaticity and heterocycle.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.45** (a balance between the negative contributions of Cl/OH and the positive contributions of aromaticity/heterocycle).

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.016392486793457776
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with **aliphatic esters (e.g., CCOC=O)** or **aldehydes (e.g., CCCCC=O)** tend to have **moderate positive values** (e.g., `CCCC=O: 0.667`, `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1: 0.834`).
   - The presence of a formate group (**HCOOR**) is seen in `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...` with a value of `0.683`, suggesting a positive contribution.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCBr: -0.902`) often have **lower or negative values**, but when combined with polar groups like C=O, the trend shifts toward positive values.
   - The molecule `CCCCOC=O` has a **4-carbon chain (butyl)** attached to a formate group, which is somewhat similar to `CCCC=O` (pentanal, `0.667`) but with an ester linkage.

3. **Ether vs. Ester**:
   - Ethers (e.g., `CCOc1ccc...`) tend to have **positive values** (e.g., `0.834`), while esters like `CC(=O)OCC` have a value of `-0.492`. However, formates (HCOOR) seem to behave differently due to the smaller size of the formyl group.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCC=O` (pentanal): `0.667`
   - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): `-0.492`
   - `CCCCOC=O` is intermediate between these two, with the formate group likely pulling the value toward the aldehyde-like behavior but with an ether-like linkage.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `CCCC=O` (pentanal, `0.667`) but with an ester linkage (which may slightly reduce the value), I predict the property for **CCCCOC=O** to be **slightly lower than 0.667 but still positive**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: `0.55`**  

This accounts for the formate group's polar nature (positive contribution) and the butyl chain's modest hydrophobic effect (slightly reducing the value compared to pentanal).

**Final answer: `0.55`**

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.02456935311740819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that might correlate with the property in question.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): **0.25903478**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): **-0.84127303**
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4-chloroaniline): **-0.31302712**
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)N1C=CN(C=C1)C(NC=O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated compound): **0.55272711**

   Chlorinated compounds show a wide range of values, but simple aliphatic chlorinated compounds (like ClCCCl) tend to have positive values (~0.2-0.5).

2. **Small Aliphatic Molecules**:
   - **CNN** (methylhydrazine): **0.27243477**
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): **-0.16168429**
   - **CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**: **0.51138234**

   Small molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., halogens, amines) often have property values in the range of -0.2 to +0.5.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - Structurally similar to **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane), which has a value of **0.25903478**.
   - Dichloromethane is slightly smaller and less polarizable than 1,2-dichloroethane, so its value might be slightly lower.

### Predicted Property for ClCCl:
Given the similarity to **ClCCCl** but with slightly reduced size and polarity, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **0.25903478**. 

**Predicted value: ~0.20** (e.g., **0.20** or **0.21**). 

However, looking at the trend for small chlorinated aliphatics, another close example is **ClCCCl** at **0.259**, and **ClCCl** might be very close to this. 

Given the data, a precise estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.25** (similar to ClCCCl but slightly adjusted). 

But since no other exact small chloromethane examples are given, the closest reference is **ClCCCl (0.259)**, so **ClCCl** would likely be in the same ballpark. 

Final answer: **0.25**. 

However, to match the precision of the given examples, let's round to:  
**0.25** or **0.26**. 

Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**0.25**. 

But reviewing the data again, **ClCCCl** is **0.259**, and **ClCCl** is smaller, so perhaps slightly lower, e.g., **0.23**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted value for ClCCl: 0.24**. 

But to be precise, let's take the average of the closest analogs (ClCCCl and small polar molecules like CNN):  
ClCCCl: 0.259  
CNN: 0.272  
Average ~0.265. 

Thus, **0.26** is a reasonable prediction. 

Final answer: **0.26**. 

However, since **ClCCl** is simpler than **ClCCCl**, perhaps **0.25** is better. 

After careful consideration, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**0.25**. 

But to match the precision of the given examples (e.g., 0.259 for ClCCCl), I'll predict:  
**0.25** (rounded from 0.259 for ClCCCl). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:  
**0.25**. 

However, looking back at **ClCCCl (0.259)** and **CCBr (-0.161)**, another approach is to note that **ClCCl** is between these in complexity, so perhaps closer to **0.259** than to **-0.161**. 

Thus, sticking with **0.25** is reasonable. 

Final answer: **0.25**. 

But to be consistent with the given examples' precision, I'll provide it to 5 decimal places like the others. Since **ClCCCl** is **0.25903**, **ClCCl** might be **0.25000**. 

Thus:  
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.25000**. 

But since the examples vary in precision, and **ClCCCl** is **0.25903**, perhaps **ClCCl** is **0.25000**. 

Final answer: **0.25000**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, **ClCCCl** is **0.25903**, and **ClCCl** is simpler, so perhaps **0.24000**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll average **ClCCCl (0.25903)** and **CCBr (-0.16168)**, weighted toward **ClCCCl**, giving ~0.25. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.25000**. 

But since **ClCCl** is smaller than **ClCCCl**, perhaps **0.24000**. 

Given the data, the most defensible answer is:  
**0.25000**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:  
**0.25000**. 

However, to match the style of the examples (some are rounded to 8 decimal places), I'll provide:  
**0.25000000**. 

But since many examples are shorter, I'll stick with:  
**0.25000**. 

Final answer:  
**0.25000**. 

After careful consideration, the most reasonable prediction based on the given data is:  
**0.25000**. 

---

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **0.25000**.
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.7956459178619582
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Presence of hydroxyl group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has -0.825, `CC(C)C(C)O` has -0.436, `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` has -0.204).
   - However, if the -OH is part of a more complex or polar structure, the effect may vary.

2. **Aromatic rings with -OH**:
   - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (two -OH groups): -0.825
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (one -OH and one nitro): -0.756
   - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (one -OH and alkyl substitutions): -0.204
   - The property becomes less negative as the molecule becomes less polar (e.g., adding alkyl groups).

3. **Alkyl substitutions on aromatic rings**:
   - Alkyl groups (like -CH3) tend to reduce the magnitude of the negative property value when combined with -OH (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` has -0.204, which is less negative than `Oc1cccc(O)c1` with -0.825).

4. **Similar molecules**:
   - `Cc1ccc(C)cc1O` is very similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (property = -0.204), except the latter has an isopropyl group instead of a methyl. The additional alkyl bulk slightly reduces the polarity, making the property less negative.
   - Our molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` has two methyl groups and one -OH on the aromatic ring, which is structurally similar but with slightly less alkyl substitution than `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends:
- The -OH group contributes a negative property value.
- The two methyl groups reduce the magnitude of the negative effect (less polar than a plain phenol).
- The property value should be slightly more negative than `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (-0.204) because `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` has slightly less alkyl substitution (less shielding of the -OH's polarity).

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.3 and -0.4**. Averaging this with the closest analog (`CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` at -0.204), we can predict:

**Predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: -0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be needed.)

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.3305679059457488
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **-0.87403137**
     - This is a heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structure (similar to PCBs). The high electronegativity and steric bulk of chlorine atoms likely contribute to a negative property value.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.67449076**
     - This is another heavily chlorinated biphenyl, but the property is positive. The difference may arise from the substitution pattern (more symmetric vs. asymmetric).
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **-0.93853797**
     - A chlorinated phenol with strong electron-withdrawing effects, leading to a highly negative value.

2. **Key Features**:
   - Chlorine atoms tend to decrease the property value (more negative) when they dominate the structure, especially in aromatic systems.
   - Symmetry and conjugation can modulate the effect (e.g., biphenyls with chlorine may have less negative values than isolated chlorinated rings).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The target molecule is **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, which is a **chlorinated biphenyl** with the following structure:
- Two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl).
- Chlorine substitutions: 2 chlorines on one ring (positions 2 and 5) and 2 chlorines on the other ring (positions 3 and 5').

This is similar to the example **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **0.67449076**), but with fewer chlorines (4 vs. 6). Fewer chlorines would likely reduce the electron-withdrawing effect, but the biphenyl conjugation may still contribute to a positive or less negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example with property **0.67449076** but with fewer chlorines, the property value should be somewhat lower (less positive or slightly negative). However, the biphenyl conjugation and symmetric substitution may keep it positive but less so than the more chlorinated example.

A reasonable estimate would be between **0.3 and 0.6**. Given the examples, I predict:

**Predicted Property: 0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be necessary.)

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.6165354284247254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (2-methyl-2-butene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): 0.6440604  
     A linear alkane with no functional groups has a moderately positive value.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane, e.g., 2,2,4-trimethylpentane): 0.95223646  
     Highly branched alkanes tend to have higher property values than linear alkanes.
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): -1.00781608  
     A linear alkene (with one double bond) has a strongly negative value.

2. **Alkenes vs. Alkanes**:
   - Alkenes (molecules with C=C) generally have lower property values than their alkane counterparts (e.g., nonene vs. octane).
   - Branching in alkenes may mitigate this effect slightly, but the presence of a double bond still tends to decrease the property value.

3. **Branching in Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (2-methyl-2-butene). Compared to linear alkenes, branching might raise the property value slightly, but the double bond will still dominate, keeping the value negative.

### Prediction for CC=C(C)C:
- The molecule is a branched alkene with 5 carbons. 
- From the examples, linear alkenes (e.g., nonene) have very negative values (~ -1.0), while branched alkanes have higher values (~ 0.9). 
- Branching in an alkene likely raises the value compared to a linear alkene but not as high as a branched alkane. 
- A reasonable estimate would be between the linear alkene (-1.007) and the branched alkane (0.952), but closer to the alkene due to the double bond.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **CC=C(C)C** to be approximately **-0.85**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.85**
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.02456935311740819
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the provided data:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds**: 
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of **-0.98241095**.
   - **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene-like) has a value of **-0.97725527**.
   - These suggest that heavily chlorinated aliphatic/aromatic compounds tend to have strongly negative property values.

2. **Less Chlorinated or Mixed Functional Groups**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (trichlorophenol) has a value of **0.59120862**.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl-like) has a value of **0.30678442**.
   - These show that less chlorinated or mixed-functional-group compounds can have positive or less negative values.

3. **Simple Chlorinated Aliphatics**:
   - **ClCCl** is a simple aliphatic dichloromethane-like structure. The closest analog in the examples is **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**, which is more chlorinated and has a very negative value (-0.98241095). 
   - Since **ClCCl** is less chlorinated, its property value should be less negative but still likely negative due to the aliphatic chlorine substitution trend.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
Given the trend that aliphatic chlorination leads to negative property values, and the degree of chlorination correlates with the magnitude (more chlorination = more negative), **ClCCl** should have a moderately negative value. 

Comparing to the examples:
- **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**: -0.98241095 (4 Cl atoms)
- **ClCCl**: 2 Cl atoms, so less negative. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.7 and -0.9**. Given the simplicity of the molecule and lack of other functional groups, I predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.85** 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided data trends; actual values may vary if more specific patterns are at play.)
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.5694763180028968
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` has a value of **-0.96511105**.
     - `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` (bromine analog) has **-1.00193745**.
     - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.56947632**, but this is an outlier (likely due to the presence of an oxygen substituent).
   - The molecule `ClCC` has **-0.95330942**, indicating that even a single chlorine can contribute to a negative value.

2. **Oxygen Substituents**:
   - The presence of oxygen (e.g., hydroxyl `OH` or ether `O`) can sometimes increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.56947632**), but this is not always consistent.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - Aromatic rings with multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative values, as seen in the examples above.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms and one hydroxyl group. 

- It is structurally similar to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (property value = **0.56947632**), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (two chlorines adjacent to the hydroxyl and one para to it).
- The presence of three chlorines would typically push the value downward (more negative), but the hydroxyl group may counteract this slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the strong trend of multiple chlorines reducing the property value and the hydroxyl group potentially offsetting this slightly, I predict the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** to be slightly more negative than `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` but not as extreme as fully chlorinated aliphatic systems.

**Predicted property value: ~0.45 to 0.55**  
To be precise, I'll estimate **0.50** (balancing the chlorine and hydroxyl effects). 

However, looking back at `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (value = **0.56947632**), which has two chlorines ortho to the hydroxyl and one para, the target molecule has a similar substitution pattern (two chlorines ortho and one meta). The property value might be slightly lower due to the third chlorine's inductive effect. 

**Final predicted value: 0.48** (slightly lower than the analogous example). 

But since the given examples show variability, another reasonable estimate could be closer to **0.40**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45** (a compromise between the hydroxyl and chlorine effects). 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest analog is `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.569), and the target molecule is very similar. Thus, the prediction should be close to this. 

**Final answer: 0.55** (very similar to the given example with minor adjustment for the substitution pattern). 

But to be precise, since the substitution is nearly identical (just one chlorine moved), the value is likely very close to the example. 

**Exact prediction: 0.569** (same as the given example, as the substitution pattern is almost identical). 

However, the target molecule has Cl at positions 2,4,5 (ortho and meta), while the example has Cl at 2,4,6 (ortho and para). The meta substitution might slightly reduce the value compared to para. 

Thus, adjusted prediction: **0.50**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **0.50**.

True Property: -0.5573355335225991
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, ethers, etc.). The property appears to be a quantitative measure influenced by these structural attributes, possibly resembling a partition coefficient (logP), solubility, or another physicochemical descriptor.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

#### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple ether linkages (OCH3, OCO)**: These are polar but not strongly hydrophilic (e.g., methoxy groups tend to decrease polarity slightly).
2. **Aromatic rings with oxygen substituents**: Polar contributions from phenolic -OH and methoxy groups.
3. **Lactone (COC=O)**: Polar carbonyl group with some hydrogen-bonding capacity.
4. **Fused polycyclic system**: Aromatic and aliphatic rings increase hydrophobicity.
5. **Dioxolane (OCOc)**: Polar cyclic ether, but not as hydrophilic as free hydroxyls.
6. **No strong hydrophilic groups (e.g., -SO3H, -COOH, -NH2)**: Limits extreme positive values.
7. **No halogens or nitro groups**: Absence of strongly electron-withdrawing or hydrophobic substituents.

#### Comparison to training examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., sugars, polyols) tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., `OCC(O)CO` = -0.778, `OCC1OC(...)C1O` = -0.483).
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = -0.755) are more negative than purely hydrophobic aromatics (e.g., `Sc1ccccc1` = -0.631).
- The presence of a lactone (carbonyl + ether) is seen in `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.828), but this molecule also has highly hydrophobic phenyl rings, offsetting the polarity. Our target lacks such strong hydrophobic regions.
- The fused ring system is somewhat analogous to `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` (property = 0.792), but our target has far more polar groups, which would reduce the value.

#### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar (ether, hydroxyl, carbonyl) and moderately hydrophobic (aromatic, aliphatic rings) features, the property value is likely **moderately negative**, similar to polyoxygenated cyclic systems in the training data. 

### Estimated property value: **-0.45**

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.8027566652556427
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (`S` and `N`), similar to thiazole or imidazole derivatives. The presence of `C(=O)` (carbonyl) and `N` (amine) substituents suggests polar and hydrogen-bonding capabilities.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A thiomethyl group (`CS-`) attached to the ring, which is moderately hydrophobic.
   - A tertiary butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`), which is highly hydrophobic and bulky.
   - A carbonyl (`C=O`) and an amine (`NH`) on the ring, introducing polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Similar to polar heterocycles**: 
  - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property = 0.4645744) has a polar imidazole-like structure with an amide, similar to our molecule. This suggests a positive but moderate property value.
  - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = -0.45158717) has a polar heterocycle with a thioether and bulky tert-butyl group, but its property is negative due to additional electronegative atoms (oxygen). Our molecule lacks the extra oxygen, so it might be less negative or positive.
- **Bulky hydrophobic groups**: 
  - `CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = -0.21356213) has a bulky alkyne and amide, but our molecule lacks the strongly electron-withdrawing Cl, so it might trend more positive.
  - `CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1` (property = 0.94279996) has a thioether and bulky cyclohexane, yielding a high positive value. Our molecule has a similar thioether but a more polar core, so the value might be lower.

### Key Observations:
- The combination of a polar heterocycle (with `C=O` and `NH`) and a bulky hydrophobic group (`C(C)(C)C`) suggests a balance between polarity and hydrophobicity.
- The thioether (`CS-`) adds slight hydrophobicity but less than a pure alkyl chain.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like `NO2` or multiple halogens) are present, so the value likely isn't highly negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with property values between **0.2 and 0.5**, and the balance of polar/hydrophobic features, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.35**

### Rationale:
- The polar heterocycle and amide push the value toward the positive range (like `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` at 0.464).
- The bulky tert-butyl and thioether moderate this, preventing it from being as high as purely hydrophobic cases (e.g., `CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1` at 0.94).
- No strongly negative groups (e.g., `NO2`, multiple halogens) are present to pull the value below zero.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is:  
**0.35** (estimated).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.08170301445663165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) and polar substituents (e.g., -NO2, -CN, -COOR) tend to have property values in the **moderate range (0.1 to 0.8)** unless strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present.
   - Example: 
     - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has a high value of **0.958** due to extended conjugation and lack of strong polar groups.
     - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a benzofuranone derivative) has a low value of **-0.808** due to the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.

2. **Esters (R-COOR')**:
   - Esters often have **positive property values** unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups.
   - Example:
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a value of **0.780**.
     - **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl octanoate) also has a value of **0.780**.

3. **Ethyl Ester of Benzoic Acid (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)**:
   - This is **ethyl benzoate**, which has:
     - An aromatic ring (moderate contribution).
     - An ester group (positive contribution, similar to the examples above).
     - No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups beyond the ester.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): **0.780** (aliphatic ester).
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether): **0.958** (no polar groups, pure aromatic conjugation).
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**: **-0.808** (strongly electron-withdrawing diketone).

### Prediction:
Ethyl benzoate (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is an aromatic ester with no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups beyond the ester. Its property value should be:
- Lower than diphenyl ether (less conjugation, polar ester group).
- Higher than aliphatic esters (due to aromatic ring contribution).
- Similar to or slightly lower than **CCCC(=O)OCC** (0.780), as the aromatic ring may slightly reduce the value compared to pure aliphatic esters.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely **~0.65**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. If the property is something like "logP" or "dipole moment," the reasoning might differ slightly, but the relative trends would hold.)

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.5656963872912648
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe that the property values tend to correlate with the molecular structure, particularly with the presence of certain functional groups, halogens, and the overall polarity or complexity of the molecule. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), here's the reasoning for the prediction:

1. **Halogen presence (Br)**: The presence of bromine (Br) tends to increase the property value compared to purely aliphatic chains, as seen in molecules like `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (0.66698711) and `CI` (-0.60013562). However, the effect is less pronounced than with chlorine (Cl) in similar contexts.

2. **Aliphatic chain length**: The molecule is a linear alkane (heptane) with a terminal bromine. Longer aliphatic chains with no polar or aromatic groups tend to have lower (more negative) property values, as seen in `CCCCCCCO` (-0.48187706) and `CCCCCCC=C` (-0.72883584). 

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - `CI` (iodomethane) has a value of -0.60013562, but this is a very small molecule.
   - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (bromonaphthalene) has a value of 0.66698711, but this is an aromatic system, which typically increases the property value.
   - `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a value of -0.48187706, and replacing the -OH with -Br would likely result in a slightly higher value (since Br is less polar than OH but still contributes more than a pure hydrocarbon).

Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is expected to be between -0.5 and -0.7, closer to the aliphatic chain trend but slightly higher due to the bromine. 

### Predicted property value: **-0.55** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.13474957304895288
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the molecule **CO (methanol)** in this context:

1. **Functional Groups**: Methanol (CO) has a hydroxyl group (-OH), which is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. From the examples, molecules with -OH groups tend to have property values in the range of **~0.3 to ~0.9** (e.g., OC1CCCCCC1: 0.89968356, OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O: -0.3551741). However, smaller molecules like methanol may not align directly with larger polyols.

2. **Small Polar Molecules**: Simple polar molecules like **CCCCOC=O (-0.01639249)** and **CCC (-0.05978795)** have values close to zero, but methanol is more polar due to the -OH group. 

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1 (0.77946975)**: Aromatic + -OH group → high value.
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O (-0.3551741)**: Polyol but larger → slightly negative.
   - **CCC(C)CO (-0.44544822)**: Less polar than methanol → more negative.

4. **Methanol's Simplicity**: As a small, highly polar molecule, methanol likely has a property value **between 0.0 and 0.5**, leaning toward the lower end due to its simplicity (no aromaticity or complex structure).

### Predicted Property Value for **CO (methanol)**:  
**~0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, bioactivity—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)
