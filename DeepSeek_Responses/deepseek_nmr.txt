SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.23719983601726377
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally or functionally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Group**: The molecule contains an ester group (**CC(=O)OC**), which is also present in some of the examples (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** with a value of **0.59608356** and **COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC...** with a high value of **1.95417126**). Esters generally contribute positively to the property value, especially when combined with long alkyl chains or aromatic systems.

2. **Alkyl Chain Length**: The molecule has a long alkyl chain (**CCCCCCCCC**), similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (value = **0.59608356**) and **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (value = **-0.1347116**). Longer hydrophobic chains tend to increase the property value when paired with polar groups like esters.

3. **Comparison to Closest Example**:
   - The most similar molecule in the dataset is **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (property = **0.59608356**), which is nearly identical except for having two fewer carbons in the alkyl chain. The addition of two more carbons (**CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** vs. **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**) would slightly increase hydrophobicity, likely leading to a modest increase in the property value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (0.59608356) and the slightly longer alkyl chain, the predicted value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** would be **slightly higher**, likely in the range of **0.60 to 0.65**. 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**Predicted property value: 0.62**  

This aligns with the trend that longer alkyl chains with ester groups tend to have higher values in the dataset (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** at 0.596 and **COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC...** at 1.954). The absence of aromatic rings or additional polar groups keeps the value moderate.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.2595513665007123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** scaffold (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl (=O) and NH group). This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic structures in the examples (e.g., C1SC(=S)NC1(=O), O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine (Cl)** substituent on the benzene ring. Chlorine is present in many examples and tends to increase the property value (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has a high value of 1.23).
   - A **lactam-like** group (oc(=O)[nH]) with hydrogen-bonding capability. Similar groups (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1) often have negative or modest values.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Cl-containing heterocycles**: 
  - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a value of 0.909.
  - Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of 0.180.
  - ClC=C has a very low value (-1.262), but this is a much simpler molecule.
- **Heterocycles with carbonyl/NH**: 
  - O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O) has a value of -1.043.
  - C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) has a value of -0.595.

### Inference:
The presence of **Cl** will likely increase the value compared to pure heterocycles, but the **NH and C=O** groups (which can form hydrogen bonds) may pull it down slightly. The fused aromatic system adds complexity, similar to some of the mid-range examples.

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance between the Cl substituent (increasing) and the polar heterocycle (decreasing), a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.2 to 0.4**. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (0.909) is more chlorinated, so higher.
- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.180) is heavily chlorinated but with OH.
- Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (0.293) is a closer analog (Cl + polar heterocycle).

Thus, the predicted value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is approximately:  
**0.25** (with an expected range of 0.2–0.3). 

However, since the examples include more precise values, I'll refine this to:  
**Predicted property value: 0.28** (a compromise between the Cl and heterocycle effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0257568566934232
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule contains a nitro group, which is also present in **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (property value: **-0.30387743**).
   - Nitro groups often contribute to moderately negative property values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature and polarity.

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - The molecule has an isopropyl group (**CC(C)**) attached to the nitro group. Alkyl groups (e.g., methyl, ethyl) in other examples tend to slightly reduce the property value (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: **-0.30586734**).

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group and alkyl/ether substituents, with a property value of **-0.30387743**.
   - **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler (no heterocycle or ether) but has a branched alkyl group, which may slightly lower the value compared to linear alkyl-nitro compounds.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Smaller nitroalkanes (e.g., **CCN(=O)=O**) would likely have more negative values, but the branched isopropyl group adds slight steric bulk, potentially offsetting this slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is expected to be **slightly more negative** than **-0.30387743** (due to the simpler, less polar structure) but not as extreme as very small polar molecules (e.g., **ClCC**: **-1.24870473**). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (rounded to two decimal places).

### Final Answer:
**-0.35**

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.7551528624123487
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** from the examples, which has a property value of **1.64626737**). These bulky, rigid frameworks tend to have higher property values due to their complexity and functionalization.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A **ketone (C=O)** at the 4-position of one of the rings (similar to the example above).
   - A **hydroxy (OH)** group on the ring system.
   - A **primary alcohol (CH2OH)** attached to the core.
3. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, which typically increases the property value (as seen in other polycyclic examples).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **1.64626737**), which is also a polycyclic ketone but lacks the additional hydroxy and primary alcohol groups.
- The presence of **OH** and **CH2OH** groups may slightly increase the property value due to added polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** with property **0.3868863** has polar groups but is less complex).

### Adjustments:
- The additional polar groups (OH, CH2OH) likely increase the value compared to the pure polycyclic ketone example.
- However, the primary alcohol might not contribute as much as aromatic or conjugated systems (e.g., aromatic systems in the examples often have higher values).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (1.64626737) but with slightly more polar functionality, I predict a **moderately higher value**. 

**Final Prediction: ~1.75**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend that larger, more functionalized polycyclic systems have higher values in the given examples.)*

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.0016408339756688
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution). Aromatic rings with halogens (F, Cl) are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on substitution patterns.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.46875252**.
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.66377944**.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has a value of **0.01691037**.

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**). Amides generally reduce the property value (more negative).
   - Example: **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.06501415**.
   - Example: **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has a value of **-0.61283069**.

3. **Halogen substitutions**: The molecule has fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) substitutions. Halogens tend to reduce the property value, with fluorine being more electronegative than chlorine.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.46875252**.
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.66377944**.

4. **Conjugation and rigidity**: The molecule is conjugated and rigid due to the aromatic rings and amide linkages, which may slightly increase the property value compared to non-conjugated systems.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (value: **-0.06501415**), but our molecule has additional halogens and a more complex structure.
- The presence of two amides and halogens suggests a more negative value than simple aromatic systems but not as extreme as very polar molecules like **CNN** (**-1.37101047**).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the combined effects of:
- Two aromatic rings with halogens (reducing the value),
- Two amide groups (reducing the value further),
- Conjugation (slightly increasing the value),

The property value is likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.6663056919756145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular features. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Ether functional group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether groups tend to have moderately negative property values unless other functional groups dominate.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **-0.83945135**.
   - Example: `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (triethyl phosphate) has a value of **-0.23468524**.
   - Example: `COc1ccccc1O` (guaiacol) has a value of **-0.53883473**.

2. **Hydrocarbon chains**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or branched hydrocarbons generally have negative values unless polar/functional groups are present.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (tert-amyl alcohol) has a value of **-0.49631591**.
   - Example: `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.49359533**.
   - Example: `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclohexylbutane) has a value of **-0.09416714**.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branching (e.g., isopropyl group) tends to slightly lower the property value compared to linear analogs.
   - Example: `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched hydrocarbon) has a value of **-0.19416799**.

4. **No strongly polar or aromatic groups**:
   - The molecule **CCCOC(C)C** lacks strongly polar (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂) or aromatic groups, which would otherwise increase the property value.

### Prediction for **CCCOC(C)C**:
- It is an ether with a branched isopropyl group and a short propyl chain.
- Similar to other ethers and branched hydrocarbons, the value should be moderately negative.
- Comparing with `CCOC(=O)CC` (-0.839) and `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (-0.496), this molecule is simpler and less polar, so the value should be between these two.
- The branching (isopropyl) may slightly lower the value compared to linear ethers.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is approximately:  
**-0.65** (with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.1).  

This aligns with the moderately negative values observed for similar ethers and branched aliphatic compounds in the dataset.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.3979357508501502
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often increases the property value (e.g., see `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` with a value of `-0.00300041` or `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` with `1.36655648`).
   - It has a **hydantoin-like core** (two carbonyls and an NH group), similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (value `-0.14871871`), but with additional substitutions.
   - An **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is attached, which typically lowers the property value (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` has `-0.729773`).

2. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - The presence of two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom increases polarity and potential for conjugation, which often raises the property value (e.g., `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` has `1.85893143` due to extended conjugation).
   - However, the alkyl group (CCC(C)) counteracts this effect.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (polycyclic with nitrogen) has `0.67406324`.
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (bromine + carbonyl) has `-0.00300041`.
   - The given molecule is more polar than `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` due to the additional carbonyl and NH group but less conjugated than polycyclic aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the balance between the electron-withdrawing bromine and carbonyl groups (raising the value) and the alkyl group (lowering the value), the predicted property value is likely in the **low positive range**, similar to molecules with moderate polarity and substitution.

**Final Prediction**: `0.25` (estimated based on structural trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an approximate interpolation from the given data.)

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.13039753073381044
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Aromatic systems** generally have positive property values, especially when they are conjugated or fused. For example:
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large fused aromatic system) has a high value of **2.19640806**.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system with nitrogen) has a value of **1.35444212**.
   - **Cc1cc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a smaller fused aromatic system) has a value of **0.68667897**.

2. **Non-aromatic or aliphatic systems** tend to have lower or negative values. For example:
   - **CCCCCCC** (heptane) has a value of **-0.54761055**.
   - **CO** (methanol) has a very low value of **-1.56939147**.

3. **Biphenyl-like structures** (two benzene rings connected directly or indirectly) in the dataset:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a biphenyl derivative with chlorine substitutions) has a value of **1.41913757**.
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a highly fused aromatic system) has a value of **2.19640806**.

### Prediction for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl):
- Biphenyl consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, allowing some conjugation but not as extensive as fused systems.
- It is less conjugated than fused aromatic systems but more conjugated than simple benzene derivatives.
- Comparing to similar structures in the dataset, we can estimate its value to be between **0.6 and 1.4**.
- A reasonable prediction would be close to **1.0**, given its intermediate conjugation.

### Final predicted value:
**1.05** (approximate, based on the trend of aromaticity and conjugation in the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, or another molecular descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the provided data trends.)

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.7680554864559923
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**: -0.730, **CCCCCC(C)C**: -0.370) tend to have negative property values, with longer chains or branching reducing the value further.
   - Unsaturation (e.g., **CCCCCCCC=C**: -0.192) slightly increases the value compared to saturated analogs.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, carbonyls)**:
     - **CC(O)C(C)(C)C**: -0.675 (alcohol)
     - **CC1CO1**: -1.286 (epoxide, highly negative)
     - Carbonyls (e.g., esters, amides) often increase the value (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.066).
   - **Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., amines, amides, nitro)**:
     - Generally increase the value (e.g., **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.491, but nitro groups push it positive).
   - **Sulfur-containing groups**:
     - Thiols/sulfides (e.g., **CCCCS**) are not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur-containing molecules like **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**: 0.430 and **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 0.714 suggest sulfur can increase the value.
     - Thioamides (e.g., **CCNC(=S)NCC**: -0.333) are slightly negative.
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
     - Increase the value, especially with multiple halogens (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: 1.232).

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings generally increase the value (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1**: -0.177, but substitution with electronegative groups can push it higher).

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Larger, more polar molecules tend to have higher values (e.g., **CC45CCC2C(CCC3CC1SC1CC23C)C4CCC5O**: 1.545).

### Analysis of **CCCCS**:
- **Structure**: A simple aliphatic thiol (butyl mercaptan). 
- **Comparable Examples**:
  - **CCCC(=C)C**: -0.730 (unsaturated hydrocarbon)
  - **CCCCCC(C)C**: -0.370 (branched alkane)
  - **CCNC(=S)NCC**: -0.333 (thioamide, but more complex)
- **Sulfur Impact**: The presence of sulfur (thiol group) is likely to increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but not as much as aromatic or polyhalogenated systems. 

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple alkanes are negative (-0.3 to -0.7).
- Sulfur adds a slight positive contribution (but not as much as halogens or aromatics).
- No other functional groups or complexity.

I estimate the property value for **CCCCS** to be slightly negative but higher than pure alkanes. A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.25** (range: -0.3 to -0.2). 

However, looking at **CCNC(=S)NCC** (-0.333), which has a thioamide group (more polar than a thiol), **CCCCS** might be slightly less negative. Thus, a refined estimate is:  
**-0.20**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCC_S_: -0.20** (approximate range: -0.3 to -0.1).

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.49546086898980596
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., polycyclic aromatics, long aliphatic chains) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3cc4ccccc4cc13` (polycyclic aromatic) has a high value of **0.91983291**.
   - `CCCC/C=C/C` (long aliphatic chain) has a lower value of **-0.55126391**.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**: Presence of polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, halogens) can decrease the property value unless balanced by other hydrophobic features. For example:
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (polar -NH₂ and -Cl) has **-0.49197852**.
   - `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` (aliphatic + -OH) has **-0.04559308**.

3. **Branching vs. Linearity**: Branched aliphatic chains tend to have slightly lower values than linear ones (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C` has **-0.19416799**, while `CCCC` would likely be higher).

4. **Alcohols (-OH)**: Simple alcohols like `CC(C)CC(C)O` have values around **-0.67575777**, but branching can moderate this effect.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- The molecule is a **branched aliphatic alcohol** with 6 carbons and a terminal -OH group.
- Similar examples:
  - `CC(C)CC(C)O` (5 carbons, branched, -OH): **-0.67575777**.
  - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (6 carbons, branched, -OH): **-0.49359533**.
- The additional branching in **CCCC(C)(C)CO** (tertiary carbon) may slightly increase the property value compared to `CC(C)CC(C)O` due to reduced polarity, but the -OH group still dominates.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (**-0.49359533**) but with slightly more branching, the value should be slightly higher (less negative). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.006300092316756332
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group attached to one of the rings.

### Relevant Examples:
1. **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Property = -0.85818451  
   - Simple aromatic ring with no substituents has a highly negative value.

2. **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene): Property = -0.30586734  
   - Methyl groups on a benzene ring increase the property value compared to benzene.

3. **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (2-methylnaphthalene): Property = 0.19040581  
   - A naphthalene with one methyl group has a higher (less negative) value than benzene or simple substituted benzenes.

4. **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex polyaromatic hydrocarbon): Property = 0.68667897  
   - Larger fused aromatic systems with methyl groups tend to have higher property values.

### Observations:
- Adding methyl groups to aromatic systems increases the property value (makes it less negative).  
- Fused aromatic systems (like naphthalene) have higher property values than single-ring systems (like benzene).  
- The property value for **2-methylnaphthalene** (0.19040581) is a close analog to **1-methylnaphthalene**, as the position of the methyl group (1 vs. 2) is unlikely to drastically change the property.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (1-methylnaphthalene)** is structurally very similar to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (2-methylnaphthalene)**, which has a property value of **0.19040581**. The difference in methyl position (1 vs. 2) is minor, so the property value should be very close.  

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** to be approximately:  
**0.19** (likely in the range of **0.15 to 0.25**).  

For specificity, I'll assign:  
**Predicted property value = 0.20**  

This is consistent with the trend that methylated naphthalenes have values slightly above 0, while simpler aromatics (like benzene) are more negative.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.5626748088577818
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic structure with two amide (N-C=O) groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.15237207**.
   - The core is polar and moderately hydrophilic due to the amide groups.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**.
   - The branched alkyl chain adds hydrophobicity, while the vinyl group (CC=C) adds slight polarity but is still largely hydrophobic.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = -0.152) has a simpler substituent (just a methyl and vinyl group).
   - The new molecule has a longer branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC), which will increase hydrophobicity compared to the example. This would likely **decrease the property value further** (more negative).
   - However, the vinyl group (CC=C) adds a small polar contribution, offsetting the hydrophobicity slightly.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the increased hydrophobicity from the branched alkyl chain but partial compensation from the vinyl group, the property value should be **slightly more negative** than the example (-0.152). A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.25 to -0.35**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.28** (a conservative estimate balancing the hydrophobic and polar contributions). 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples, where more hydrophobic/aliphatic substituents decrease the property value, while polar/functional groups increase it.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6637794365740766
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., long aliphatic chains, aromatic rings) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (large ester with two long chains and aromatic rings): **1.81766408**  
   - **CCCCOC(=O)CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCCC** (large diester): **1.56033582**.

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**: Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -CO, -N) reduce the property value. For example:
   - **CCO** (ethanol): **-1.38994961**  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol, highly polar): **-0.40125098**.

3. **Aromatic Rings**: Aromaticity alone contributes moderately, but substitution with polar groups lowers the value. For example:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23** (polyaromatic): **1.18295213**  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (anisole with -OH): **-0.53883473**.

4. **Halogen Substitution**: Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to increase the property value slightly compared to unsubstituted aromatics, but the effect depends on the number and type of halogens. For example:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: **-0.16921636**  
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): **1.29869349**.

5. **Fluorine**: Fluorine is highly electronegative but small, and its effect is less pronounced than heavier halogens. For example:
   - No direct examples with **-CF3**, but **Cl** substitutions suggest **-CF3** would behave similarly or slightly lower due to fluorine's smaller size.

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is **benzene substituted with a -CF3 group** (trifluoromethylbenzene). 
- The **-CF3 group is moderately polar but not as bulky as Cl/Br/I**, so it will likely reduce the property value compared to unsubstituted benzene (no direct example, but benzene derivatives with polar groups tend to have lower values).
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: **-0.16921636** (two halogens, one heavy).  
  - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**: **-0.12922379** (alkyl-substituted benzene).  
  - **-CF3** is more polar than **-CC** but less bulky than **-Cl/I**, so the value should be slightly lower than **-0.12922379** but higher than highly polar molecules like **CCO (-1.38994961)**.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.25** (between the values for alkylbenzenes and small polar molecules).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-0.169)** and **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (-0.129)**, **-CF3** is more polar than **-CC** but less than **-I**, so the value should be slightly lower than **-0.129**. A good guess is:  
**-0.20**.

However, since **-CF3** is more polar than **-CH3** but less disruptive than heavy halogens, and no direct examples are given, the safest interpolation is:  
**-0.18**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.18**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.4872524822081954
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (a hexose sugar like glucose or mannitol, but with all hydroxyl groups explicitly shown). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = -0.40125098) tend to have moderately negative property values due to high polarity and hydrogen bonding.
2. The presence of aromatic rings or conjugated systems often increases the property value (e.g., **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**, property = 0.13039753).
3. The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has even more hydroxyl groups than **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, which would likely make it more polar and increase its hydrogen-bonding capacity. However, the cyclic structure may slightly reduce flexibility compared to the linear polyol.

Given these trends, the property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** should be slightly more negative than **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (-0.40125098) due to the additional hydroxyl group and cyclic structure, but not drastically so. 

**Predicted property value: -0.45 to -0.55**  
A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-0.48** (similar to the linear polyol but adjusted for the cyclic structure). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 2.179291711596598
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule contains a multi-ring steroid-like structure (similar to the examples with multiple fused rings, e.g., `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`, which has a property value of **1.50840378**).
2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: There are multiple carbonyl groups (acetate-like fragments: `CC(=O)O` and `CC(=O)C`), which are polar and may influence the property.
3. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (e.g., `C3(O)` and `C(O)`) adds polarity, similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property: **-0.40125098**), but here they are part of a larger hydrophobic scaffold.
4. **Conjugated double bond**: The `C=CC` fragment suggests some degree of conjugation, which may slightly increase the property value.
5. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and complex, resembling some of the higher-property-value examples (e.g., `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` with **1.90530571**).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The steroid-like core with carbonyls is most similar to:
  - `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property: **1.87946017**)
  - `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (property: **1.50840378**)
- The additional hydroxyl groups and acetate fragments may slightly reduce the property compared to the purely ketone-containing steroid examples, but the overall scaffold dominates.

### Predicted property:
Given the structural similarity to the high-property-value steroid-like molecules and the balancing effects of polar groups, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 1.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as no exact match exists in the provided data. The value reflects the dominance of the hydrophobic steroid core with moderate polarity from carbonyls and hydroxyls.)

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 1.3298946877578801
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an alcohol group (-OH), and a ketone group (C=O). 

Breaking it down:
1. **Steroid backbone**: Molecules with fused ring systems (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.17403639). The presence of multiple rings increases the value.
2. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: This adds polarity and tends to increase the value (as seen in other examples with -OH).
3. **Ketone group (C=O)**: This also contributes to polarity and increases the value, especially when part of a rigid ring system.

Comparing to similar structures:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` has a value of **1.17403639** (steroid-like with -OH).
- `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of **1.98224768** (complex with multiple polar groups).
- The given molecule has more rings and fewer polar groups than the latter but is more complex than the former.

Given this, the predicted property value for `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 1.35** (rounded to two decimal places). 

This aligns with the trend where fused ring systems with polar groups (OH, C=O) have values >1.0, and increased complexity raises the value further.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.04363814715147868
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH₃-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (NO₂)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: Contains an aldehyde (C=O) and methoxy (OCH₃) on an aromatic ring. Property: **-0.394**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**: Nitrobenzene. Property: **-0.600**.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1**: Contains an amide (CON) and a cyclic aliphatic chain. Property: **0.381**.
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2**: Contains an amide, nitro group, and aromatic ring. Property: **0.725**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (e.g., nitrobenzene: -0.600).
   - Amides (especially aromatic amides) can increase the property value (e.g., 0.381 to 0.725 in similar cases).
   - The combination of an acetamide and a nitro group on the same aromatic ring suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing (nitro) and electron-donating (amide) effects.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both an acetamide (moderately increasing the property) and a nitro group (decreasing the property), the molecule is likely to have a property value slightly above neutral but not as high as some of the more complex amides in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.2**, considering:
- Nitrobenzene: -0.600
- Aromatic amides: ~0.4 to 0.7
- The combined effect of both substituents likely places it in the lower end of the positive range.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.25** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.6358125572437276
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a moderately polar and bulky group. Similar bulky/polar groups (e.g., esters, amides) in the examples tend to contribute positively to the property (e.g., **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a value of **1.416**).
2. **Chlorinated Benzofuran-like Ring (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The presence of **Cl** (electron-withdrawing) and the fused heterocycle (benzofuran-like) suggests moderate polarity. 
   - Compare to **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = **0.0169**) or **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (property = **0.5198**). The fused ring here may increase the value slightly.
3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as the other features.

### Analogous Examples:
- **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = **1.416**): Contains polar amide + heterocycle + aromaticity.
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (property = **0.5198**): Chlorinated biphenyl system.
- **CCCCNC(=O)n1c(NC(=O)OC)nc2ccccc12** (property = **1.202**): Polar amide + fused heterocycle.

### Prediction:
The molecule combines:
- A phosphorothioate group (moderate positive contribution).
- A chlorinated fused heterocycle (moderate positive contribution).
- Ethoxy groups (neutral/slight negative contribution).

Given the examples, the property likely falls in the range of **0.8 to 1.4**. A reasonable estimate is **1.1**, balancing the contributions of the polar/aromatic components.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8543445978789622
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - Simple alcohols with short carbon chains tend to have negative property values:
     - **CCC (propane)**: -1.26537801 (no -OH, but shows that small alkanes are very negative)
     - **CC(C)CO (isobutanol)**: Not in the list, but similar to **CC(C)CO** (tert-butanol).
     - **CC(C)CO (tert-butanol)**: This is a tertiary alcohol with a branched structure. 
   - Other alcohols:
     - **CCCCCCC(C)O (2-octanol)**: -0.31415346
     - **CCCC(O)CCC (4-heptanol)**: -0.49359533
     - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (sorbitol)**: -0.40125098 (polyol, but still negative)
   - Branching seems to reduce the negativity slightly compared to linear alcohols.

2. **Branched vs. Linear**:
   - Branching often leads to less negative values compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CO** vs. **CCCCO**).
   - Tertiary alcohols (like **CC(C)(C)CO**) are more sterically hindered, which may slightly increase the property value compared to primary/secondary alcohols.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO (isobutanol)**: Not in the list, but **CC(C)CO** is similar to **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol). 
   - **CC(C)CO** is less branched than **CC(C)(C)CO**, so the latter might have a slightly higher (less negative) value.

4. **Trend for Tertiary Alcohols**:
   - Tertiary alcohols are more hindered, which could lead to a less negative value. For example:
     - **CC(C)CO** (if it were present) might be around -0.8 to -1.0, but **CC(C)(C)CO** (more branching) could be closer to -0.7 to -0.9.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCC** (propane) is -1.26537801 (no -OH, very negative).
- **CC(C)CO** (similar to isobutanol) would likely be around -0.9 to -1.1 (but not in the list).
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) has more branching, which typically reduces negativity slightly. 

Comparing to **CC(C)CO** (not in the list but similar to **CC(C)(C)CO**), the value is likely slightly higher (less negative) than **CC(C)CO**. 

From the examples:
- **CC(C)CO** (if it were present) might be around -0.9 to -1.0.
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (more branched) would likely be around -0.8 to -0.9.

A reasonable estimate is **-0.85**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is **-0.85**.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.544641231837579
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
The molecule is a **purine-like heterocycle** with the following features:
- Contains two fused rings (similar to purine or imidazopyrimidine).
- Has multiple nitrogen atoms (N) and a carbonyl group (C=O), indicating polar and hydrogen-bonding capabilities.
- Likely exhibits moderate polarity due to the N-H and C=O groups.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (Property: -0.74990143):  
   - This is a fluorinated pyrimidone with an amine group. It is polar and has hydrogen-bonding groups, leading to a negative property value.  
   - Our molecule is more conjugated and has more nitrogen atoms, but lacks fluorine. The additional nitrogen atoms may increase polarity but the fused ring system could reduce solubility compared to simpler heterocycles.

2. **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (Property: -0.74826908):  
   - This is a uracil-like fragment with an amine group. It is polar and has hydrogen-bonding groups, similar to our molecule.  
   - Our molecule is more rigid and fused, which might slightly increase the property value compared to this example.

3. **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (Property: -0.26595251):  
   - This is a methoxy-substituted purine-like system. The methoxy group reduces polarity compared to our molecule, which has more hydrogen-bonding groups (N-H and C=O).  
   - Our molecule should have a more negative property value than this due to higher polarity.

4. **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23** (Property: 0.17816319):  
   - This is a thiophene-fused triazole system. It is less polar than our molecule, which explains its slightly positive property value.  
   - Our molecule is more polar, so its property value should be lower (more negative).

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity of **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, its property value should be **negative** and closer to the uracil-like examples (around **-0.7**). However, the additional nitrogen atoms and fused ring system might slightly increase the value compared to the simplest cases.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This balances the polarity (which would push the value more negative) and the rigidity/conjugation (which might slightly offset it).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of polar molecules having negative values in the given data.)  

**Final answer: -0.65**

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0197482553845363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Alcohols**:
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (heptanol): -0.49359533  
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -1.21136278  
   - **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** (tert-butanol): -0.67575777  
   - **CCCCCCCO** (octanol): -0.49274029  
   These suggest that simple alcohols and aliphatic chains tend to have negative property values, with branching slightly lowering the value further.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): -0.23468524  
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ester): 1.87946017  
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (complex glycoside): 3.49099347  
   Esters and carbonyl groups can have varying property values, but simple esters (like methyl acetate) tend to be slightly negative or near zero.

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is a simple ester with a small aliphatic component (methyl and acetyl group).  
   - Compared to **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate, -0.23468524), methyl acetate is smaller and less polarizable, so its property value might be slightly more negative.  
   - Compared to **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, not in the examples but similar), we can infer a value around **-0.5 to -0.3**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O)** is expected to have a property value close to **-0.4**. 

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- **CCOC=C** (ethyl vinyl ether): -1.0377041 (very negative due to the ether and alkene).  
- **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O**: 0.44727546 (complex, polar, and functionalized).  

Since methyl acetate is simpler and less polar than many of the esters in the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)  

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.660810114840576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea moiety (**N-C(=O)-N**). 
   - Urea-like structures in the examples (e.g., **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**) have property values close to zero (e.g., **-0.00705408**), suggesting that the urea core itself does not strongly influence the property in either direction.
   - However, this molecule has two aromatic rings, which may increase the property value compared to aliphatic or simpler urea derivatives.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - The presence of two phenyl rings (**c1ccccc1**) is similar to **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: **0.00630009**) or **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** (property: **0.41687489**), where aromaticity tends to increase the property value slightly.
   - No electron-withdrawing or donating substituents are present on the rings, so the effect is neutral compared to halogenated or substituted aromatics.

3. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - The urea group is polar and can participate in conjugation with the aromatic rings, which may slightly increase the property value compared to non-conjugated systems.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **N-C(=O)-N** core with aliphatic groups: Near zero (e.g., **-0.00705408**).
- **Aromatic rings without strong substituents**: Small positive values (e.g., **0.00630009** to **0.19040581**).
- **Urea with aromatic rings**: Likely higher than aliphatic urea but not as high as highly substituted or polycyclic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** should be **moderately positive**, likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

This balances the neutral contribution of the urea core with the slight positive influence of the two aromatic rings.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.2394540331447885
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**, depending on substituents.
   - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more fused rings generally have higher values. For example:
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a large PAH) has a value of **1.18295213**.
     - `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` (a smaller fused system) has a value of **-0.0155423**.

2. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)**:
   - Fluorene has three fused rings (two benzene rings fused to a cyclopentadiene ring). This is smaller than the large PAH example but larger than simple benzene derivatives.
   - It lacks polar or electronegative substituents (like halogens or heteroatoms), which would otherwise significantly alter the value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (large PAH): **1.18295213**.
   - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene, a simple aromatic): **-0.57633213**.
   - Fluorene is intermediate in size, so its value should be between these two.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Fluorene's structure suggests a value **higher than simple aromatics but lower than large PAHs**.
- A reasonable estimate would be **~0.6 to 0.9**, leaning toward the middle of this range.

From the examples, the closest structurally similar molecule is `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (value = 1.18295213), but fluorene is smaller, so we adjust downward. 

**Predicted property value for fluorene: ~0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**0.75** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data).

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.17750247760555057
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: An electron-donating amino group on the phenyl ring.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is polar due to the sulfonyl and amino groups.
   - It is moderately sized (not as large as some polycyclic examples in the dataset).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with sulfonyl groups (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**) have values around **0.53**.
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**) have values around **-0.40**.
   - The guanidine-like group may increase the property value slightly due to its basicity and polarity.

4. **Trends in the Dataset**:
   - Small, nonpolar molecules (e.g., **CC(C)Cl**) have negative values (around **-1.07**).
   - Polar or conjugated systems tend to have positive values (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43** has **1.86**).
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (like sulfonyl and amino) suggests a value in the low-to-mid positive range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the polarity and structural features, the predicted property value for **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.65** (specific predicted value).  

This balances the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group, the electron-donating amino groups, and the guanidine-like moiety.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.1244129599436081
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property value tends to increase with the following structural features:

1. **Increased molecular size/complexity** (e.g., long aliphatic chains or polycyclic structures like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` with a high value of 2.86178487).
2. **Presence of nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** often increases the value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has -0.53485491, but when combined with other features, it contributes to higher values like in `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` with 1.36655648).
3. **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `CF3`, halogens)** can increase the value, especially when combined with nitro groups or aromatic systems.
4. **Aromatic systems with multiple substituents** (especially nitro or halogen groups) tend to have higher values.

Now, let's analyze the target molecule:  
**`CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`**

### Key features:
1. **Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** attached to an aromatic ring (strong electron-withdrawing effect).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`)** on the aromatic ring (another strong electron-withdrawing group).
3. **Tertiary amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`)** with an unsaturated branch (moderate influence).
4. **Aromatic system** with multiple substitutions (increases complexity).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (1.36655648): Has one nitro group, a halogen, and a complex heterocycle. Our target has two nitro groups and a CF3, which are even more electron-withdrawing.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` (1.14798875): Less electron-withdrawing but still a high value due to amides and aromatic substitutions.
- `CCC(=C(CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2` (1.36366101): No nitro groups but conjugated aromatic systems.

Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of two nitro groups and a CF3, along with the aromatic system and tertiary amine, the property value should be **higher than 1.36655648** but likely below 2.0 (since it lacks very large aliphatic/polycyclic components).

### Predicted value: **~1.45**  
(Reasoning: Similar to `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` but slightly higher due to the additional nitro group and CF3.)

**Final answer: 1.45** (approximate, based on structural trends in the data).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0197482553845363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Aldehydes (C=O)**: 
     - **CCCC=O** has a property value of **-1.07077861**.
     - **C=CC=O** (not explicitly given, but similar to **C=CC=C** with **-1.09324285**) suggests aldehydes tend to have negative values around **-1.0**.
   - **Ethers (C-O-C)**:
     - **CCCCCCCCO** (ether-like alcohol) has **-0.31329842**.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has **-0.06653768**.
     - Ethers seem to moderate the property value less negatively than aldehydes alone.
   - **Esters (COC=O)**:
     - **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester (specifically, methyl acetate with an isopropyl group).
     - Esters in the examples:
       - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** has **-0.50316789**.
       - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has **-0.06653768**.
     - Esters tend to have property values between **-0.5 and -0.1**, depending on other substituents.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)O**) often reduces the property value slightly compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O** has **-0.49359533**, while **CCC(C)(C)O** has **-0.85247906**).
   - **CC(C)OC=O** has branching (isopropyl group), which may push the value slightly more negative.

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid) is not in the examples, but esters like **COC=O** (methyl formate) are similar to **CC(C)OC=O**.
   - The isopropyl group (**CC(C)**) is less polar than a methyl group, which may further reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the ester group (**COC=O**) and the branching (**CC(C)**), the property value is likely slightly more negative than **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (**-0.50316789**) but less negative than **CCCC=O** (**-1.07077861**). 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.6 and -0.7**. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **CC(C)CCOC=O** has **-0.66273007** (branched ester).
- **CC(=O)N** (amide) has **-1.30799788**, but esters are less negative.

Thus, for **CC(C)OC=O**, the predicted property value is approximately:
**-0.66**

### Final Answer:
**-0.66**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.4252698342947853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with the following features:
- Aromatic ring (benzene) with:
  - Two methyl groups (`C` and `Cc1`) at positions 1 and 3 (meta-substitution).
  - A hydroxyl group (`O`) at position 4 (para to one methyl, ortho to the other).
- No halogens, nitro groups, or other strongly polar/electron-withdrawing substituents.
- Moderately polar due to the hydroxyl group but balanced by hydrophobic methyl groups.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **-0.79348128**
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (hydroxyl-substituted naphthalene-like): **-0.14668216**
   - `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` (dihydroxy with alkyl chain): **0.35346977**
   - The hydroxyl group tends to lower the property value, but alkyl groups or additional substitutions can increase it.

2. **Methyl-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (dimethylbenzene): Not explicitly given, but similar to `CCc1ccccc1C` (ethylbenzene): **-0.30959843**
   - Methyl groups are weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic, slightly increasing the property compared to unsubstituted benzene.

3. **Combined Features**:
   - The target molecule has both methyl groups and a hydroxyl group, which will partially offset each other's effects. 
   - The hydroxyl group is more polar and will dominate, but the methyl groups will raise the value compared to plain phenol.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends:
- Phenol: **-0.793**
- Adding methyl groups (e.g., toluene-like) raises the value by ~0.5 (e.g., toluene would likely be around **-0.3**).
- Here, with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl, the net effect is likely closer to the phenol value but slightly higher due to the methyl groups.

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on interpolation of the given examples. The actual value would likely fall between -0.6 and -0.3, with -0.45 being a reasonable midpoint.)*  

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is a heuristic estimate based on the assumption that the property scales with polarity/hydrophobicity (higher values for hydrophobic/less polar molecules). If the property is something else (e.g., dipole moment), the reasoning would differ. Based on the examples, the trend suggests **higher values for less polar/more hydrophobic molecules**.
==================================================
Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.9082121361332782
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Core (P(=S)(OC))**: This functional group appears in several examples, and its presence tends to increase the property value (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** has a value of **0.95492843**, and **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has **0.85038032**). The P(=S) group is a strong contributor to higher values.
   
2. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents (Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1)**:
   - The ring has an **SC (thioether)** group, which is moderately electron-donating but less polar than Cl/Br substituents in the examples.
   - A **methyl (C)** group is present, which is weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic.
   - The **O-** linkage (ether) is also present, similar to other examples.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analogs are the phosphorothioate-containing molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents (Cl, Br, I), which have values in the range **0.85–1.15**.
- The **SC** group is less polar than halogens but still contributes to the property value due to its sulfur atom (sulfur is more polarizable than carbon but less than halogens).
- The **methyl (C)** group slightly reduces the property compared to halogens.

### Estimated Value:
Given the above, the property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is expected to be slightly lower than the halogenated phosphorothioates but still in the higher range due to the P(=S) core. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

This is based on:
- The P(=S)(OC) group contributing ~0.8–1.0 (as seen in other examples).
- The SC and C substituents being less polar than halogens, reducing the value slightly compared to fully halogenated analogs (e.g., **0.85** for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**). 

Thus, **0.75** is a balanced prediction.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.1039774970185579
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** tend to have **positive property values**, especially when the chlorination is extensive and symmetric. For example:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **1.29869349**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (octachlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **1.49340948**.

2. The given molecule is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a **heptachlorinated biphenyl-like structure** (7 Cl atoms). It is structurally similar to the above examples but with one fewer chlorine than the octachlorinated case.

3. The property value increases with the number of chlorines and the symmetry of substitution. The hexachlorinated case is ~1.30, and the octachlorinated case is ~1.49. The heptachlorinated case would likely fall between these two.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** would be approximately **1.4**, interpolating between the hexa- and octachlorinated examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.42**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.024901816403672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**: 
   - **CCC** (propane): -1.26537801  
   - **CC** (ethane): -1.44481988  
   - **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.80921402  
   - **CC(=C)C** (isobutene): -1.0895895  
   - **CCCCCCCCC** (nonane): -0.18872682  
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.19416799  
   - **CCI** (iodoethane): -0.93129045  
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal): -0.71189489  
   - **CC(=C)C=C** (diene): -0.91380099  

   These molecules have **negative property values**, with simpler/smaller alkanes being more negative. Branched or longer chains are less negative.

2. **Nitro Compounds**:
   - **N(=O)=O** (nitro group) appears in several molecules:
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): -0.0823054  
     - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: 1.12806631  
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): -0.49168315  
     - **Oc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthol): -0.1131024  

   Nitro groups tend to **increase the property value** compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure. Aromatic nitro compounds are less negative than aliphatic ones.

3. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds**:
   - The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (nitropropane) is an aliphatic nitro compound. From the examples, aliphatic nitro compounds are not explicitly given, but we can infer:
     - The nitro group is polar and electron-withdrawing, which likely **increases the property value** compared to pure alkanes (e.g., propane: -1.265).
     - However, it is not as strongly positive as aromatic nitro compounds (e.g., trinitrobenzene: -0.082).

### Prediction:
- **CCCN(=O)=O** is structurally similar to propane (**CCC**) but with a nitro group replacing a hydrogen. 
- The nitro group will **raise the property value** compared to propane (-1.265), but not as much as in aromatic nitro compounds.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.8**, closer to values like **CC(=O)C=C** (-0.913) or **CCCCCC=O** (-0.711).

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately:  
**-0.65** (a rough estimate based on interpolation).  

(Note: Without a direct example of an aliphatic nitro compound in the training set, this is an educated guess. The actual value may vary slightly but should fall in this range.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.560552754320492
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### 1. Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, which is a disubstituted benzene ring with:
- A **fluorine (F)** substituent.
- A **bromine (Br)** substituent.

This is similar to other halogen-substituted benzene rings in the dataset, such as:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -0.36420441): Chlorine and bromine substituents.
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property: 0.9092615): Multiple chlorine substituents.
- **COc1ccccc1Cl** (property: -0.40882197): Methoxy and chlorine substituents.

### 2. Key Observations:
- Halogen substituents (Cl, Br, F) tend to result in negative property values unless there are multiple halogens or additional functional groups that increase the value.
- The presence of **fluorine (F)** is somewhat similar to chlorine but may have a slightly different effect due to its higher electronegativity and smaller size.
- The molecule **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (Cl and Br substituents) has a property value of **-0.36420441**, which is a reasonable starting point for comparison.

### 3. Adjusting for Fluorine vs. Chlorine:
Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine but smaller in size. In many physicochemical properties, fluorine substituents can have a similar or slightly more negative effect than chlorine. However, the exact impact depends on the property being predicted (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.).

Given that:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **-0.36420441**,
- **COc1ccccc1Cl** (methoxy + Cl) has a value of **-0.40882197**,
- **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely to have a value in a similar range but possibly slightly more negative due to fluorine's stronger electronegativity.

### 4. Predicted Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would be slightly more negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, but not drastically so. A good prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.40**

### 5. Cross-Checking with Other Examples:
- **COc1ccccc1Cl** (methoxy + Cl): -0.40882197
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (Cl + Br): -0.36420441
- **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (F + Br) should fall between these, leaning toward the more negative side due to fluorine.

Thus, **-0.40** is a well-justified prediction.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is **-0.40**.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.1277546789291262
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Framework**: The molecule is a bicyclic structure with two fused rings (a cyclohexane and a cyclopentane). It has a tertiary alcohol group (`C(O)`), two quaternary carbons (`C(C)(C)`), and no highly polar or charged functional groups (e.g., no nitro, sulfonyl, or strongly electron-withdrawing groups).
2. **Size and Complexity**: It is a mid-sized molecule (C10H18O) with moderate complexity, similar to some of the steroid-like or terpene-like structures in the examples (e.g., `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO)` with property = 2.33487018, but simpler).
3. **Functional Groups**: The presence of an alcohol (`C(O)`) and quaternary carbons suggests moderate polarity but no strong contributions to the property from highly polar or conjugated systems.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with simple alcohols or aliphatic rings (e.g., `CC(C)(C)CO` = -0.8543446, `CC1CCCO1` = -0.92790916) tend to have negative property values.
- More complex polycyclic structures with additional polar groups (e.g., ketones, halogens) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO` = 2.33487018).
- This molecule is intermediate: more complex than simple alcohols but lacks strongly contributing groups like ketones or halogens.

### Predicted Property:
Given its structural similarity to moderately complex alicyclic alcohols but without strongly polarizing features, the property value is likely in the **low positive range**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- Simpler aliphatic alcohols being negative (~ -0.8 to -0.9).
- More complex polycyclics with additional polar groups being >1.0.
- This molecule being in between, leaning slightly positive due to ring strain and the alcohol group.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.0087959665821773
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 1.86768394). The presence of P(=S) often correlates with higher property values in the dataset.
2. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (similar to a phthalimide-like structure), which is also present in the molecule above (property = 1.86768394). This substructure tends to increase the property value.
3. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are present in both molecules, contributing to moderate hydrophobicity and bulkiness.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest match is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 1.86768394). The only difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a lactam instead of a thioether). 
- The lactam ring is slightly less polarizable than the thioether group, so we might expect a marginally lower property value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity, the property should be slightly lower than 1.86768394 but still in the same range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.75** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value would likely be closer to 1.75-1.80 based on the dataset trend). 

For precision, I would predict:  
**1.78** (interpolating between the closest examples). 

However, since the original dataset includes highly specific decimals, a more exact prediction might be **1.79115613** (adjusting for the structural difference). 

But given the constraints (no tools/exact calculations), the most defensible answer is:  
**~1.78** (approximate). 

If forced to pick a single value from the given style:  
**1.78294501** (hypothetical interpolation). 

But the closest justified answer is:  
**1.78** (based on the P(=S) and lactam combination). 

### Final Answer:  
**1.78** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on structural analogs in the dataset.) 

---

**Correction**: Upon re-evaluating, the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is almost identical to **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 1.86768394), except for the **SC(CCl)** → **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** substitution. The lactam is slightly less polarizable than the thioether, so the property should be *slightly lower*. 

Thus, a more precise prediction would be **~1.80** (since the dataset shows P(=S) with lactam-like structures in the 1.5–1.8 range). 

But given the very close similarity to the 1.867... example, I’d estimate:  
**1.82** (assuming the lactam’s electron-withdrawing effect slightly offsets the loss of the thioether). 

However, to stay conservative, I’ll stick with:  
**1.78**. 

---

**Final refined answer**:  
Given the uncertainty, the safest prediction is:  
**1.79** (splitting the difference between the closest examples). 

But since the original dataset has values like 1.867..., 1.554..., etc., and this molecule is structurally between them, **1.79** is reasonable. 

### Exact Prediction:  
**1.79115613** (to match the dataset’s decimal style). 

(But realistically, this is an educated guess—the true value would require the actual property being modeled!) 

---

**TL;DR**: The predicted property is **~1.79**. 

(If you can clarify the property being predicted, I could refine further!) 

---

**Post-hoc note**: If this is logP, the value seems high, but the dataset includes P(=S) systems with values >1.8, so **1.79** is plausible. 

**Final answer**: **1.79**.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.28076802532685197
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core (two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring with a carbonyl group, resembling a uracil or hydantoin derivative). This is similar to some of the given examples with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups (e.g., `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` with a property of **0.44965403**).
2. **Aromatic Systems**: It has two aromatic systems (a benzene ring and a pyridone-like ring), which often contribute positively to the property (e.g., fused aromatic systems like `C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54` have high values like **1.47086751**).
3. **Substituents**: It has two methyl groups (`-C`), which are relatively non-polar and may slightly decrease the property compared to more polar or electron-withdrawing groups.
4. **Electron-Withdrawing Carbonyl (=O)**: This group can increase the property due to its polarity (similar to other carbonyl-containing molecules in the examples).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` (property = **0.44965403**): This has a similar hydantoin-like core with a phenyl group, but our molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more conjugated system, likely increasing the property.
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (property = **0.3868863**): Less aromatic but similar core; our molecule's aromaticity should increase the property.
- `CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3` (property = **1.37130584**): This has more polar groups (sulfone, additional carbonyl), but our molecule's fused aromaticity is comparable.

### Estimated Property:
Given the above, the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** likely has a property value in the range of **0.8 to 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

This balances the contributions from the aromatic systems, carbonyl group, and methyl substituents.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.3011257573164722
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes)**:
   - **CCC(=C)C**: -0.91014764 (branched alkene)
   - **CCCCC**: -0.90649428 (linear alkane)
   - **CCCC(C)(C)CO**: -0.49546087 (branched alkane with -OH)
   - Hydrocarbon chains generally have negative property values, with branching or functional groups increasing the value slightly.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO**: -0.86816516 (polyol, highly negative)
   - **CCOC(=O)N**: -1.06155195 (ester/amide-like, very negative)
   - **COC=O**: -1.37777694 (formate ester, very negative)
   - Oxygenated compounds (alcohols, esters) tend to have negative values, especially if polar or small.

3. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)N**: -1.06155195
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: 0.05775797 (long-chain ester, less negative)
   - Esters with longer alkyl chains have less negative (or slightly positive) values compared to small esters.

4. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) often increase the property value, especially in aromatic systems (e.g., polychlorinated aromatics have high positive values).

5. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatics with substitutions (e.g., halogens, polar groups) can have positive or negative values depending on the substituents.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a linear ester: **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate).
- It has a 6-carbon alkyl chain attached to a carbonyl (C=O) and an ethoxy (OCC) group.
- Compared to similar examples:
  - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoic acid methyl ester): 0.05775797
  - **CCOC(=O)N**: -1.06155195 (smaller ester)
- The longer alkyl chain in **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** will reduce the polarity compared to small esters, bringing the property value closer to zero but likely still slightly negative.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Long-chain esters have property values near zero or slightly positive.
- This is a medium-chain ester (C6), so the value should be slightly negative but closer to zero than small esters like **CCOC(=O)N** (-1.06).

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4174695349241921
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, which is methyl benzoate (a benzoate ester with a methoxy group attached to the carbonyl carbon).

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Simple aromatic esters** (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, property = -0.23802767) tend to have negative property values, but the magnitude depends on substituents.
2. **Electron-withdrawing or bulky groups** (e.g., halogens, nitro, or additional aromatic rings) often increase the property value (e.g., Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2, property = 0.32511352).
3. **Methyl substitution** (COC instead of CCOC) may slightly alter the property compared to ethyl substitution, but the effect is not drastic.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): property = -0.23802767  
  This is structurally very similar to **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), with only a difference in the alkyl group (methyl vs. ethyl). Since methyl is slightly less electron-donating than ethyl, the property value might be marginally more negative.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to ethyl benzoate and the lack of additional functional groups, the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be close to but slightly more negative than -0.23802767.  

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity).  

*(Note: If higher precision is required, a value like -0.245 could also be reasonable, but the examples suggest the model does not demand extreme precision.)*  

---  
**Final answer: -0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.9138009903908348
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Simple hydrocarbons with few or no functional groups tend to have lower (more negative) values, while more complex molecules with polar or aromatic groups tend to have higher (less negative or positive) values.

The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds (conjugated diene). Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

- **CC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene with one double bond) has a value of **-0.91014764**.
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, a conjugated alkene with an aromatic ring) has a value of **-0.46599307**.
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **-0.31426229**.
- **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a value of **-0.98865588**.

Since **C=CCC=C** is a simple conjugated diene with no additional functional groups or rings, its value should be slightly higher (less negative) than **CC/C=C/C** but lower than **C=Cc1ccccc1** (due to the lack of an aromatic ring). 

A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.7 and -0.8**. Averaging the trends, I predict:

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -0.78** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.6977867208255398
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to halogenated compounds and their impact on the property value.

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Halogenated compounds** (especially with Cl, Br, I) tend to have property values that are **moderate to high**, depending on the number and type of halogens:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high value of **1.49340948**.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.12145847**.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of **0.01691037**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a polyhalogenated alkane) has a value of **-0.92888079**, but this is likely due to the presence of fluorine (which is highly electronegative and may lower the property value).

2. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)** is a **fully brominated methane** with three heavy bromine atoms. Bromine is less electronegative than fluorine but more polarizable than chlorine, which could lead to a **moderate positive property value**.

3. Comparing to **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform), which is not explicitly in the dataset but is structurally similar, we might expect a slightly higher value due to bromine's larger size and polarizability.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Polyhalogenated compounds with **Br** tend to have **positive but not extremely high values** (e.g., **0.12145847** for bromonaphthalene).
- The presence of **three bromines** on a single carbon (like in **BrC(Br)Br**) would likely increase the property value compared to mono- or di-brominated compounds but not as high as heavily chlorinated aromatics.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (moderate positive value due to heavy bromination).  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.867683937637134
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.79994143). This group tends to increase the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, contributing to intermediate property values (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** = 0.32735995).
3. **Chlorine substitution (CCl)**: Present, which can slightly increase or decrease the property depending on context (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** = -0.07932053, but **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** = -0.7028781).
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: Similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 1.34694497), suggesting a positive contribution.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are polar but not strongly influential on their own (e.g., **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** = -0.34491159).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule resembles **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1.79994143) due to the **P(=S)** group and aromatic/chlorine components.
- It also has similarities to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (1.34694497) due to the lactam and aromatic rings.
- The presence of **CCl** and additional complexity (ethoxy groups) may slightly reduce the property compared to the first example but keep it higher than the second.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value is likely between **1.3 and 1.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.65**  

This balances the contributions from the phosphorothioate group, aromatic rings, lactam, and chlorine substitution.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.5543388772707654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide group**: `CN(C)C(=O)` – Similar to `CN(C)C(=O)C` (property = -0.93879149) and `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = -0.61224383). Amides tend to lower the property value.
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` – Similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (property = 0.51982952) and `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 0.9092615). Chlorinated aromatics often increase the property value.
   - **Heterocyclic fragment with carbonyl**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` – Similar to `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (property = 0.37166658). Such fragments tend to have moderate positive contributions.
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` – Similar to `CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3` (property = 2.51568788). Bulky alkyl groups can increase the property value.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is large and polar, with multiple functional groups contributing to both positive and negative property values. The presence of Cl and the bulky tert-butyl group likely outweigh the amide's negative contribution.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analogs are molecules with amides, chlorinated aromatics, and heterocycles. For example:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = -0.61224383) is simpler but has two amides.
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (property = 0.51982952) has two chlorinated rings.
     - `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (property = 0.37166658) has a similar heterocycle.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- The amide (`CN(C)C(=O)`) might contribute ~ -0.6.
- The chlorinated aromatic ring could contribute ~ +0.5.
- The heterocycle (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) might add ~ +0.3.
- The tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) could add ~ +0.5.

Adding these (with some cancellation), the net property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to other complex molecules in the dataset (e.g., 0.5–1.5).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is **0.75**. 

(Note: This is a heuristic prediction based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.8212234462914207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have property values in the range of **-0.4 to +0.5**, depending on other functional groups. 
   - Example: 
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → **0.51982952** (two chlorines + aromatic rings)
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → **-0.0146173** (four chlorines + phenol).

2. **Phenol Groups (-OH on aromatic rings)**:
   - Phenols generally lower the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → **-0.40404929**).
   - Multiple -OH groups further decrease the value (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` → **-0.86816516**).

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromaticity alone (without strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups) tends to result in values around **-0.2 to -0.5** (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1` → **-0.31426229**).

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule has:
     - Two phenol groups (each with -OH).
     - Three chlorine atoms (electron-withdrawing).
     - Two linked aromatic rings (increased size/complexity).
   - Similar molecules with phenol + Cl (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) have values around **-0.4**.
   - Adding more Cl and another phenol ring would likely push the value slightly higher (less negative) due to increased size and halogenation, but the -OH groups counteract this.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between:
- Electron-withdrawing Cl (+ effect on property value).
- Electron-donating -OH (- effect on property value).
- Increased aromatic bulk (slight + effect), 

the property value is likely in the range of **-0.2 to 0.1**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.15**  

*(This balances the opposing trends while aligning with similar structures in the dataset.)*

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.9101476364255348
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`CC/C=C\C`  
This is **2-pentene**, a simple alkene with a trans double bond (indicated by the `\` and `/` notation). 

**Similar examples from the dataset:**  
1. `CC/C=C/C` (property: **-0.91014764**) – This is **2-pentene** with a cis double bond (note the `/` on both sides).  
2. `CCCC(=O)OC` (property: **-0.83945135**) – An ester, more polar than an alkene.  
3. `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (property: **2.86178487**) – A very long alkane (high hydrophobicity).  

**Analysis:**  
- The property value for `CC/C=C/C` (cis-2-pentene) is **-0.91014764**.  
- The trans isomer (`CC/C=C\C`) is typically slightly less polar than the cis isomer due to reduced dipole moment.  
- However, the difference between cis and trans isomers in this case is likely small, as the overall structure is similar.  

**Prediction:**  
Given the similarity to `CC/C=C/C` and the fact that trans-alkenes are usually slightly less polar (but not drastically so), I predict the property for `CC/C=C\C` to be **slightly higher** (less negative) than the cis form.  

**Final predicted value:**  
**-0.89** (rounded from an estimated value close to but slightly higher than -0.91014764).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend observed in the given examples, where simple alkenes and alkanes tend to have negative values, while larger or more conjugated systems have higher values.)*

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.8448925161304414
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Ethers**:
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -1.32204386  
   - **C** (methane): -1.62426174  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -1.142602  
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -1.21136278  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -0.23802767  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.53883473  

   Simple hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing molecules (ethers, alcohols) tend to have negative property values, with more branching or unsaturation leading to lower (more negative) values.

2. **Ether-Specific Examples**:
   - There are no exact ether examples in the training set, but **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate, which has an ester group) has a value of -0.23802767. Pure ethers (like **CCCOCC**) are likely to have more negative values than esters due to the lack of polar carbonyl groups.

3. **Chain Length and Oxygen**:
   - Longer carbon chains with oxygen (e.g., **CCC(O)CC**: -0.85247906) tend to have moderately negative values.  
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.66273007  

   The property becomes less negative as complexity or polarity increases.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- **CCCOCC** is a simple, symmetrical ether with no branching or unsaturation. Compared to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, -1.21136278), the ether linkage (**O**) is less polar than an alcohol (**OH**), but the molecule is larger than **CC#C** (-1.32204386) or **CCC#C** (-1.142602).  
- The property value is likely between **-1.0** and **-0.6**, closer to **-0.8** as it is less polar than alcohols but more substantial than small hydrocarbons.  

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is approximately:  
**-0.85**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or more data would be needed.)

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide group**: `C(=O)N` (present in many examples with varying contributions).
   - **Tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)` attached to the amide nitrogen (bulky hydrophobic group).
   - **Two aromatic rings**: `c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2` (phenyl groups, common in the examples).
   - **Tertiary amine**: `N(C)` linked to the amide and one phenyl ring.

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **two aromatic rings** (e.g., biphenyl-like structures) tend to have property values in the **0.4–0.7 range** (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has 0.457).
   - **Amides** with aromatic substituents (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`) have values around **1.4**.
   - Bulky hydrophobic groups (e.g., tert-butyl) can increase the property value slightly (see `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` with -0.496 vs. simpler alkanes with lower values).
   - The **tertiary amine** (`N(C)`) may slightly increase the value compared to secondary amines.

3. **Comparison to Closest Examples**:
   - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (1.416): Similar amide + two aromatic rings, but with an additional heterocycle (higher value).
   - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (0.457): Two aromatic rings but no polar groups (lower value).
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` (0.564): Amide + aromatic-like rigidity (but no phenyl rings).

### Prediction:
The molecule has:
- Two phenyl rings (contributing ~0.4–0.5).
- A bulky tert-butyl group (slight positive contribution).
- A polar amide group (positive contribution).
- A tertiary amine (neutral to slight positive effect).

Given these features, the value is likely **higher than 0.5** but **lower than 1.4** (due to lack of additional heterocycles or strong polar groups). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (between the biphenyl-like and amide-aromatic examples). 

This aligns with the structural contributions observed in the training data.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.003000414107672698
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Aromatic rings** with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Br, NO₂, Cl) tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` = -0.560, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` = -0.468).
   - **Amide groups (N-C=O)** often appear in molecules with moderately positive or near-zero property values (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = 1.333, `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = -0.007).
   - **Bromine substituents** on aromatic rings tend to pull the property value toward zero or slightly negative (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` = -0.494, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` = 0.039).

2. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - Molecules with conjugated systems (e.g., aromatic rings + polar groups) often have property values in the range of -0.5 to +0.5 unless other strongly influencing groups are present.
   - The **amide group (CC(=O)N-)** in this molecule is conjugated with the aromatic ring, which may stabilize the structure and push the property value toward zero.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (phenol with Br) has a property value of **-0.494**.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (toluene with NH₂) has a property value of **-0.502**.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (amide with two aromatic rings) has a property value of **0.967**.
   - The presence of the amide group in **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely to increase the property value compared to simple Br-substituted aromatics but not as high as highly conjugated or bulky amides.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (an aromatic amide with a Br substituent) is expected to have a property value **between -0.3 and 0.2**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.15**  

This balances the electron-withdrawing effect of Br (pulling toward zero) and the moderately positive influence of the amide group.

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.137541003700004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Benzene Ring (Aromatic) Substituents**:
   - Simple alkyl-substituted benzenes tend to have negative property values, but the magnitude depends on the size/branching of the alkyl group.
     - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not explicitly given, but similar to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.309) and **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (+0.006).
     - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.309 (ethyl + methyl substitution).
     - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-naphthalene-like): +0.006 (more aromatic rings increase value slightly).
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**): -0.126 (less negative than linear alkyl chains).

2. **Alkyl Group Influence**:
   - Longer/branched alkyl chains attached to polar or aromatic groups often decrease the property value (more negative).
     - **CC(C)CO**: -1.033 (branched alkyl + hydroxyl).
     - **CC(C)CCO**: -0.854 (branched alkyl + ether-like).
   - For **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, the branched **isobutyl** group (**CC(C)C-**) is attached to benzene, similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.126) but without the extra methyl on the ring.

3. **Combining Trends**:
   - The isobutyl group (**CC(C)C-**) is more bulky than ethyl or linear propyl, which may slightly increase the property value compared to simpler alkyl benzenes (e.g., **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** at -0.309).
   - However, it lacks additional aromatic rings or polar groups that push the value toward positivity (e.g., naphthalene cores or nitro groups).

### Prediction:
Given the structure **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene):
- It is most similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.126) but without the extra methyl on the ring, which would make it slightly more negative.
- It is also comparable to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.309), but branching (**CC(C)C-** vs **CC-**) typically reduces the magnitude of negativity.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.20 and -0.40**. Splitting the difference, we predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (approximate; likely between -0.20 and -0.30). 

For specificity, we'll round to **-0.28**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6487967987695751
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with aldehydes/ketones (e.g., **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** with -0.6379, **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** with -0.0863) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has a conjugated carbonyl (C=O directly attached to a benzene ring), which may slightly increase the property value compared to non-conjugated carbonyls due to resonance stabilization.

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., **COc1ccccc1** with -0.6035, **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** with 1.5208) show that larger conjugated systems increase the property value.
   - Benzaldehyde has a single benzene ring, so its value should be closer to simpler aromatic compounds.

3. **Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** with -0.3409) reduce the property value less than electron-donating groups (e.g., **COc1ccccc1** with -0.6040).
   - The aldehyde group is moderately electron-withdrawing but also polarizable due to conjugation.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol) has -0.4624.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide with two phenyl rings) has +0.8479.
   - Benzaldehyde is simpler than these, likely between -0.5 and -0.3.

### Prediction:
Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has:
- A conjugated carbonyl (less negative than non-conjugated).
- No additional functional groups to significantly raise/lower the value.
- Similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** but without the phenol (less negative).

Given these factors, the predicted property value is approximately **-0.45**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (estimated based on structural analogs).

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.1818204310687935
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like core** (O=C2CN(N=...)C(=O)N2), which is a cyclic dipeptide-like scaffold. Such structures often exhibit moderate polarity and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - It has a **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to an aromatic ring, which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing. 
   - The aromatic ring is fused to a heterocycle (likely an oxazole or similar), adding rigidity and conjugation.
   - The **N=C linkage** suggests potential for resonance and planarity.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of two carbonyls (C=O), a nitro group, and multiple nitrogens indicates high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with **nitro groups** (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) tend to have property values in the **0.5–1.3 range**, depending on other substituents.
- Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, property = 1.33) often have higher values.
- The diketopiperazine-like core is somewhat analogous to `CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3` (property = 0.826), but with additional polar nitro and aromatic features.

### Predicted Property:
Given the **high polarity, nitro group, and cyclic amide structure**, the property value is likely in the **upper mid-range** of the examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.95**  
*(Likely range: 0.85–1.10, leaning toward the higher end due to the nitro group's strong contribution.)*

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.4510920510452662
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.68669452**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.33179838**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This difference in bonding (single vs. double) typically reduces conjugation and electron delocalization, which often correlates with lower property values in this dataset.

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Linkage**:
   - The presence of a **N-N** single bond (hydrazine-like linkage) is less electron-delocalizing than a **N=N** double bond (azo linkage). Thus, we expect the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** to be lower than that of **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (0.33179838) but higher than a simple aniline (**Nc1ccccc1**, -0.68669452).

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - The molecule **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** (carbazole-like structure) has a property value of **0.41687489**, which is higher due to fused aromatic rings and nitrogen inclusion. However, **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less conjugated and not fused, so its value should be lower.
   - The molecule **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (0.33179838) is the closest analog, but with reduced conjugation in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, we expect a slightly lower value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (0.33179838) but with reduced conjugation due to the single N-N bond, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately:

**0.25**  

This estimate balances the electron-delocalizing effect of the two phenyl rings with the reduced conjugation from the N-N single bond. The value is slightly lower than the azo analog but higher than simple aniline.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.23088031096664938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring). The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests moderate polarity.
2. **Ring System**: The molecule has a bicyclic structure with one 5-membered ring (likely a pyrrolidine or similar) and one 6-membered ring (cyclohexane). Fused rings with amides are seen in some of the examples (e.g., **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**, which has a property of **-0.00705408**), but this molecule is more rigid and symmetric.
3. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, which often reduces entropy-related contributions to properties like solubility or partition coefficients.
4. **Polarity vs. Hydrophobicity**: The amides increase polarity, but the cyclohexane ring adds hydrophobicity. This balance is similar to some of the mid-range values in the examples (e.g., **0.3 to 0.6**).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property: **-0.00705408**): This is a smaller, less rigid diamide with no fused rings. Our molecule is more rigid and symmetric, likely increasing the property slightly.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property: **0.3868863**): This has a similar diamide structure but with alkyl substituents. Our molecule lacks long alkyl chains but has a fused ring, which may place it in a similar range.
- **Cn2c(=O)on(c1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1)c2=O** (property: **0.42919525**): This has polar groups and aromaticity, but our molecule is less polar due to the lack of aromaticity and halogens.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polarity (from amides) and hydrophobicity (from the cyclohexane ring), along with symmetry and rigidity, the property value is likely in the **0.3 to 0.5** range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.42**  

This aligns with the examples where similar diamide structures with moderate polarity and fused rings exhibit values in this range.

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.7145455105046593
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.46875252**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **1.41913757**.
   - The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, especially if the molecule is larger or more conjugated.

2. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorobiphenyl** derivative with chlorines on both rings. It is more conjugated and symmetric than dichlorobenzene but less chlorinated than the example with **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) substitution.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The given molecule is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, but with fewer chlorines (3 Cl atoms instead of 5). The latter has a value of **1.41913757**, so we expect the property for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** to be lower but still positive due to the aromatic conjugation and chlorine substitution.

4. **Trend in Property Values**:
   - More chlorines and larger conjugated systems → higher property values.
   - The molecule is intermediate in complexity between dichlorobenzene (-0.468) and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl (1.419).

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** should be **positive and moderately high**, likely between **0.8 and 1.2**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.05**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolation from the given examples. If the property is something like "logP" or "polarizability," the trend would align with this reasoning.)  

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional insights?

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.12922379360878902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**: 
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline) has a property value of **-0.5025888**.
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a property value of **0.22406331**.
   - The presence of longer alkyl chains (e.g., hexyl) seems to increase the property value compared to shorter chains (e.g., methyl).

2. **Symmetry and Branching**:
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is symmetric with two ethyl groups (similar to hexylbenzene but with two shorter chains). Symmetry and multiple alkyl groups may moderately increase the property value compared to single alkyl substituents.

3. **Polar vs. Non-Polar Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -NO2, -OH, -CO) tend to have lower or higher values depending on the context, but **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is purely hydrophobic, which aligns with hexylbenzene (0.224) but with less contribution due to shorter chains.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 0.22406331
   - **CCc1ccccc1** (ethylbenzene): Likely lower than hexylbenzene but higher than methylbenzene (not in the list, but methylaniline is -0.502).
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene): Two ethyl groups may compensate for the shorter chain length, placing it close to hexylbenzene but slightly lower.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and two ethyl groups, the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** should be slightly lower than hexylbenzene but higher than ethylbenzene. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.2446697789122717
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **4-amino-N-sulfonylaniline**, with the following features:
1. An aromatic benzene ring substituted with:
   - An amino group (-NH₂) at position 1.
   - A sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O) at position 4.
2. The sulfonamide group is highly polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donor and acceptor).
3. The molecule has both electron-donating (NH₂) and electron-withdrawing (sulfonamide) groups, creating a push-pull effect.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (4-nitroaniline):
   - Property value: **-0.42806815**
   - Similar to our target but with a nitro group (-NO₂) instead of sulfonamide. The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, and the property is negative but not extremely low.

2. **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine-like structure with amino group):
   - Property value: **-0.48297339**
   - A heterocycle with hydrogen-bonding capability, similar to the sulfonamide in polarity.

3. **Nc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cc1** (amide-substituted aniline):
   - Property value: **0.97285318**
   - This has an additional amide group, which is less electron-withdrawing than sulfonamide but still polar.

4. **Oc1cccc2cccnc12** (hydroxy-substituted heterocycle):
   - Property value: **-0.19880075**
   - Less polar than sulfonamide but still hydrogen-bonding.

### Key Observations:
- Sulfonamides are more polar and electron-withdrawing than simple nitro or amide groups.
- The presence of both NH₂ and sulfonamide suggests moderate polarity but not extreme (unlike highly hydrophobic or very large conjugated systems).
- The property values for polar, hydrogen-bonding molecules in the dataset range from **-0.48 to +0.97**, with sulfonamide-like groups tending toward the higher end of this range.

### Prediction:
Given the sulfonamide's strong polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability, but balancing the electron-donating NH₂ group, the property value is likely **slightly positive but not extremely high**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- Similarity to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.43)** but adjusted upward due to the sulfonamide being less electron-withdrawing than nitro but more polar.
- The value falls between the moderately polar examples in the dataset. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.7716777480471181
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like** or **pyrene-like** structure. Specifically, it resembles **pyrene** (but with a slightly different connectivity) or a linear tetracene derivative. 

Key observations:
1. **Aromaticity**: The molecule is fully conjugated and aromatic, similar to other PAHs in the dataset (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene, or pyrene derivatives).
2. **Size and Substituents**: It has no heteroatoms or substituents (like Cl, Br, or NO₂), which simplifies the prediction. Larger PAHs in the dataset tend to have higher property values due to increased π-electron density and polarizability.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: 1.36705785): A 4-ring PAH with a methyl group.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property: 1.45205663): A 5-ring PAH (similar to picene).
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: 0.68667897): A 3-ring PAH (phenanthrene derivative).

This molecule is a 4-ring PAH without substituents, so its property value should lie between the 3-ring and 5-ring examples. Given the fully conjugated system, we expect a **moderately high value**, similar to or slightly lower than the 4-ring methylated example (~1.36).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to other PAHs and the trend in the dataset, a reasonable prediction is:  
**1.30** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples).

### Exact Value:
For precision, I would estimate:  
**1.32** (interpolating between the 4-ring and 5-ring examples). 

However, since the unsubstituted 4-ring PAH is less polarizable than the methylated one (1.367), a slight reduction is warranted. Thus:  
**Predicted property: 1.28**  

But reviewing the examples again, the closest match is **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, which is structurally almost identical to the 5-ring example (1.452) but with one fewer ring. Scaling down proportionally:  
- 3-ring: ~0.68  
- 4-ring: ~1.28  
- 5-ring: ~1.45  

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**1.28** (with confidence that it lies between 1.2 and 1.4 based on the dataset).  

For the exact value, I'll select:  
**1.28** (as a balanced estimate).  

---
**Final Answer:** The predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is **1.28**.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.9069956469937681
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This structure features:
1. Multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH), which increase polarity and likely contribute negatively to the property (based on trends in the examples).
2. A carbonyl group (C=O), which may have a moderate positive contribution.
3. An aromatic system with extended conjugation, which could increase the property value due to larger molecular size and π-electron systems (similar to some of the higher-valued examples).
4. No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups, which often lower the property in the examples.

Comparing to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** has a value of **1.49686074** and shares some aromaticity and polar groups.
- **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** has a value of **1.53247317** and is structurally similar (polyaromatic with –OH and C=O).

The molecule here has even more hydroxyl groups and a fused ring system, likely increasing polarity and size further. However, the lack of halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups suggests the value won’t be as high as some of the most extreme examples (e.g., >3.0).

**Predicted property value: ~1.6**  
*(Rationale: Slightly higher than the similar examples due to additional –OH groups and extended conjugation, but not exceeding 2.0 due to absence of very large hydrophobic/heterocyclic systems or strong electron-withdrawing effects.)*  

**Final answer: 1.60** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the provided data).

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.2555676560598258
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC)**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.906).
   - **Polar or electronegative atoms (O, N, S, P, Cl)**: Generally increase the property value, especially when multiple are present.
   - **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**: Often associated with higher positive values (e.g., 0.850, 1.146, 1.777).
   - **Aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., nitro groups, halogens)**: Can increase or decrease the value depending on the substituents.
   - **Complexity and size**: Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids, multi-ring systems) tend to have higher positive values.

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = 0.850 (P=S, multiple Cl, aromatic).
   - **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = 1.146 (P=O, multiple Cl, aromatic).
   - **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: Property = 1.777 (P=S, P=O, complex structure).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** with an amide linkage (NC(C)=O) and a thioether (SC).
- No aromaticity or halogens, but it has polar groups (P=O, C=O, S).
- Structurally similar to phosphorus-containing examples but less complex than the highest-valued ones.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of P=O and other polar groups, the value should be **positive and moderate**. Comparing to similar molecules:
- Simpler than **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (1.146) but more polar than **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.850).
- The lack of aromaticity or halogens may limit the value.

**Predicted Property Value: 0.95**  
(Reasoning: Between 0.85 and 1.15, closer to 1.0 due to P=O and amide/thioether contributions.)
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -1.0756756634277997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Haloalkanes**: 
   - **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane with a methyl group): -0.8119346  
   - **CCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.729773  
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): -1.12923228  
   - **CCC=O** (butanal): -1.25022048  
   - **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane): -0.77034855  
   - **CC1=CCCCC1** (methylcyclohexene): -0.63342551  

   These molecules have relatively low (negative) property values, likely due to their simplicity and lack of polar/functional groups.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics/Aliphatics**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 1.29869349  
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): -0.40404929  
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4-chloroaniline): -0.49197852  

   Chlorine substitution tends to increase the property value, especially in aromatic systems, but the effect is less pronounced in simple aliphatics.

3. **Double Bonds**: 
   - **CC(=C)C** (2-methylpropene): -0.73070577 (similar to branched alkanes)  
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl): 0.13039753  

   Unsaturation (C=C) alone doesn't significantly increase the property value unless conjugated with other features (e.g., aromatics).

4. **Dichloro-Substituted Molecules**: 
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is structurally simple, with no aromaticity or additional functional groups. The closest analogs are:
     - **CCBr** (-1.129) and **CCCCBr** (-0.770) for halogenated aliphatics.
     - **CCC=O** (-1.250) for a simple unsaturated molecule.

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- The molecule is a simple dichloro-substituted alkene. 
- Chlorine adds some polarity, but the lack of conjugation or aromaticity limits the property value.
- Compared to **CCBr** (-1.129) and **CCCCBr** (-0.770), the two chlorines and double bond might slightly increase the value, but it will still be negative due to the lack of complex features.
- The value is likely between **-0.7 and -1.0**, closer to **-0.8** as a compromise between the halogen effect and simplicity.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.85** (specific value estimated based on trends). 

This is a reasonable interpolation given the examples, but note that without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate.
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.9438828624029861
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**, depending on substituents.
   - For example:
     - `CNc1ccccc1` (methylaniline): **-0.487**
     - `Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32` (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): **0.424**
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (large polyaromatic): **1.521**

2. **Heteroatoms in Aromatic Rings**:
   - Nitrogen in aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine-like structures) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - For example:
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (nitrogen-containing polyaromatic): **0.331**
     - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (nitrogen-rich ring): **-0.266** (likely due to electronegativity effects).

3. **Simple Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is more polarizable than benzene but lacks bulky substituents or extended conjugation.
   - Comparing to similar-sized aromatic systems:
     - `CNc1ccccc1` (benzene derivative): **-0.487**
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (larger N-containing system): **0.331**
   - Pyridine is intermediate in complexity between these two, so we expect a value between **-0.5 and 0.3**.

4. **Electronegativity and Polarity**:
   - The nitrogen in pyridine introduces polarity, which may increase the property value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene derivatives tend to be closer to zero or negative).

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, **pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is likely to have a property value slightly higher than benzene derivatives but lower than larger nitrogen-containing polyaromatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.15**  

This reflects its aromaticity with moderate polarity from the nitrogen, placing it between simple hydrocarbons (-0.5 to 0) and more complex N-heterocycles (0.3+).

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.994960571313352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Ether (OCC(O)CO-)**: Similar to "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" (property = -0.401) and "C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" (property = -0.721). Ethers and polyols tend to have negative values.
   - **Ester (COC(=O)-)**: Present in "CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC" (property = 0.382). Esters can contribute positively.
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents (c1ccccc1N-)**: Similar to "CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1" (property = -0.067). Aromatic amines can slightly lower the value.
   - **Chlorinated aromatic system (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)**: Chlorine on aromatics appears in "Clc1ccc(I)cc1" (property = -0.169) and "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" (property = 1.104). Chlorine's effect depends on context, but here it's part of a fused heteroaromatic system, which may increase the value (e.g., "c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54" has a high value of 1.521 due to fused rings).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule combines **polar groups (ether, alcohol, ester)** with **aromatic systems (including a chlorinated fused ring)**.
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene-like) in the examples tend to **increase the property value** (e.g., 0.417 for "c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3").
   - The ester group is likely to contribute a **positive increment**, as seen in the examples.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - "CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC" (property = 0.382) has two ester groups and a simple aromatic ring.
   - "O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2" (property = 0.661) has two aromatic rings linked by polar groups.
   - The presence of a **chlorinated fused aromatic system** here is akin to larger fused systems in the examples (e.g., 1.521 for a highly fused ring), but less extreme.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- A polar ether-alcohol chain (slight negative contribution),
- An ester (positive contribution),
- A fused aromatic system with chlorine (moderate positive contribution),

the property value is likely **between 0.4 and 0.7**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.58**  

This balances the positive contributions from the ester and fused aromatic system with the slight negative effect of the polyol/ether chain.
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8516240151388451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: 
   - Small, non-polar molecules (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1**) tend to have low or negative property values.
   - Larger or more polar molecules (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O**, **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23**) tend to have higher positive values.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: 
     - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclohexanol) has a value of **-0.396**, suggesting that a single -OH group on a hydrocarbon backbone does not significantly increase the property value.
     - **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol (1-pentanol), similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** but with a shorter chain.
   - **Polar groups (e.g., carbonyl, amide, nitro)**: These often increase the property value (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Oc1cc(C)nn1c2ccccc2** has a value of **0.757**).

3. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCC(=O)CCCC**) tend to have slightly negative values (**-0.174**), but adding polar groups can offset this.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCO** is structurally similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclohexanol, **-0.396**) but with a linear 5-carbon chain instead of a cyclic 6-carbon chain. Linear chains are typically less rigid and may have slightly lower property values than cyclic analogs.
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.496**, suggesting branching reduces the property value further.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and one -OH group. 
- It is less polar than many of the higher-value examples (which have multiple polar groups or conjugated systems).
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (**-0.396**), **CCCCCO** is likely to have a slightly lower value due to its linear (less rigid) structure and shorter chain.
- However, it is more polar than pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, **-0.314**), so its value should be higher than those.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for **CCCCCO** to be approximately:  
**-0.45** (between **-0.396** for cyclohexanol and **-0.496** for the branched alcohol).

### Final Answer:
**-0.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.7379619548035242
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`), which is common in many examples. Aromatic rings with simple substituents (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2`) tend to have moderate positive values (~0.47), but here the benzene is part of a larger heterocyclic system.
2. **Sulfonyl Group (`S(=O)(=O)`)**:
   - Sulfonyl groups are polar and can increase the property value, especially when part of a cyclic system (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 0.88).
3. **Amide Linkage (`C(=O)N`)**:
   - Amides are polar and can contribute to higher values (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of 0.85).
4. **Heterocyclic Ring (`CCO1`)**:
   - The 5-membered ring with oxygen and sulfur is somewhat similar to `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` (value: -0.064), but the sulfonyl group here is more polarizing.
5. **Overall Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately large with multiple polar groups (sulfonyl, amide, ether), which suggests a higher value than simple aromatic systems but not as high as very large or heavily substituted systems (e.g., the last example with value 3.77 is much larger).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups and amides tend to have values in the range of **0.8 to 1.5** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` = 0.85, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = 0.88).
- The presence of the benzene ring and heterocycle adds to the complexity but doesn't drastically increase the value beyond this range.

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of polar groups (sulfonyl, amide) and the moderately sized structure, the predicted property value is likely in the **middle of the 0.8–1.5 range**. 

**Final Prediction: ~1.15**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an estimate based on structural similarity to the provided examples. If the property is something like "logP" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would differ.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 1.5500403565413796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I'll analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, aromaticity, and functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, carbonyls, etc.).

### Given molecule:
**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Structural features:
1. **Aromatic system**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is electron-withdrawing and often increases the property value (e.g., `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O` has -0.415, but larger aromatic systems with nitro groups can have higher values).
2. **Carbonyl groups**: Two ester groups (`C(=O)OC`), which are polar and can increase the property (similar to `CCOC(=O)CC...` examples with values ~1.1-2.5).
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen**: A nitrogen in a non-aromatic ring (`NC(=C)`), which may contribute modestly.
4. **Substituted aromatic system**: The benzene ring is fused to a non-aromatic ring, increasing molecular complexity (similar to polycyclic systems in the examples with higher values).

### Comparison to examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems: 
  - `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O` has -0.415, but this is simpler.
  - Larger fused systems like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` have very high values (2.196).
- Molecules with multiple esters/polar groups:
  - `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has 2.535 (high due to size and two esters).
  - `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has 1.128.
- The given molecule is smaller than the largest examples but has significant polarity and aromaticity.

### Predicted property:
Given the nitro group, two esters, and fused aromatic system, the value is likely **between 1.2 and 1.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.45**  

This aligns with similar mid-sized polar aromatic molecules in the examples (e.g., `CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC` at 1.465, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` at 1.493).
==================================================
Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.5897640398558062
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, which is relatively polar and rigid.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms suggests high polarity, which often correlates with higher property values in the given dataset (e.g., amides and imides tend to have positive values).
3. **Rigidity**: The cyclopropane ring and cyclic imide structure add rigidity, which may further increase the property value (rigid, conjugated systems in the dataset often have higher values).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)**: Property = -0.94388286 (heterocyclic but lacks carbonyls).
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = 0.21899914 (amide + aromatic).
- **O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23**: Property = 1.02286138 (cyclic amide + aromatic).
- **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**: Property = 1.15222898 (cyclic imide + aromatic).

The molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is a cyclic imide without aromaticity but with high polarity and rigidity. Given that:
- Non-aromatic cyclic amides/imide structures in the dataset (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**) have high values (~1.879).
- The lack of aromaticity may reduce the value slightly compared to aromatic imides (which are ~1.0–1.5).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between high polarity/rigidity and lack of aromaticity, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.85**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the dataset. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -1.2487047256992443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.90649428  
     This is a simple alkane with no functional groups, and it has a low (negative) property value.
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.99230924  
     A cyclic alkene, also with a low value.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.66346851  
     Aromatic ring with a single chlorine substituent; slightly higher than simple alkanes but still negative.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorobenzene): -0.07932053  
     More chlorines increase the property value compared to monochlorobenzene.
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorinated cage compound): 1.14774001  
     Highly chlorinated and complex structure leads to a positive value.

2. **Small Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is a simple halogenated alkane with one chlorine and two carbons.  
     From the examples, small halogenated alkanes are not explicitly given, but we can infer:
     - Chlorine increases the property value compared to pure alkanes (e.g., pentane is -0.906, while chlorobenzene is -0.663).  
     - The effect of chlorine is additive (more chlorines → higher value).  
     - **ClCC** is simpler than chlorobenzene, so its value should be lower than -0.663 but higher than pure alkanes like pentane (-0.906).

3. **Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -1.44719067  
     A nitrile group leads to a very low value, but this is not directly comparable to chloroethane.
   - **c1ccoc1** (furan): -1.15877003  
     Heterocyclic compounds can have very low values, but again, not directly comparable.

### Prediction for ClCC:
- Chloroethane is a small molecule with one chlorine and no other functional groups.  
- Its value should be between simple alkanes (e.g., pentane at -0.906) and chlorobenzene (-0.663).  
- Since it is less complex than chlorobenzene but more polar than pentane, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than pentane but lower than chlorobenzene.  

### Estimated Property Value for ClCC:
**-0.75** (approximate, based on interpolation between pentane and chlorobenzene).  

This is a rough estimate, but it aligns with the trend that adding halogens (like chlorine) increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, while smaller/simpler molecules tend to have lower values.  

**Final Answer: -0.75** (approximate).
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.0015118666941515233
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine (Cl) Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have higher property values when the Cl atoms are part of aromatic systems or bulky aliphatic groups (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl** has a high value of **1.90530571**).
   - Simple aliphatic Cl-substituted molecules (e.g., **ClCC(Cl)Cl**) have negative values (e.g., **-0.86704583**).

2. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - Aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S) tend to have moderate property values unless heavily substituted with electronegative groups (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23** has **0.42006186**).
   - Nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) often reduce the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has **-0.34093177**).

3. **Bulky/Aliphatic Groups**:
   - Bulky aliphatic groups (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) tend to have negative or low values unless combined with aromatic systems or polar groups.

4. **Combination of Aromatic + Polyaliphatic Cl**:
   - Molecules with an aromatic ring and a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) have high values (**1.41913757**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which consists of:
- A chlorinated pyridine ring (**Clc1cccc(n1)**).
- A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group attached to the pyridine.

This structure is similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property value **1.41913757**), but with a pyridine ring instead of a benzene ring. Pyridine is slightly more polar than benzene, but the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group dominates the property value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong influence of the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group and the aromatic system, the property value should be slightly lower than **1.41913757** due to the pyridine's polarity. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximate, likely in the range of 1.2 to 1.3). 

For a more precise prediction, additional examples with pyridine + **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** would be needed, but this is a reasonable interpolation based on the given data.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.6730371909840185
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol): Property = -0.49359533
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property = -0.4448969
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property = -0.67490273
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (2-ethyl-1-butanol): Property = -0.67490273
   - **OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23** (a sugar-like molecule with multiple -OH groups): Property = 0.44595404

   Alcohols generally have negative property values unless they are part of larger or more complex structures (e.g., the sugar-like molecule).

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains or branching tend to slightly lower the property value (e.g., compare **CCCC(O)CCC** with **CCC(C)CCO**).
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (2-hexanol), similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) and **CCC(CC)CO** (2-ethyl-1-butanol), which both have a property value of -0.67490273.

3. **Position of -OH Group**:
   - Secondary alcohols (like 2-hexanol) seem to have slightly less negative values than primary alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO** vs. **CCCC(O)CCC**), but this is not a strong trend in the given data.

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O**:
Given that:
- It is a branched alcohol (similar to **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**).
- The property values for these similar molecules are -0.67490273.
- The -OH group is on a secondary carbon, which might slightly increase the value compared to primary alcohols (but the effect is small in the given data).

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is likely close to **-0.67**. 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**-0.65** (slightly higher than -0.67490273 due to the secondary alcohol effect, but still in the same range). 

However, since the exact match for branching and chain length in the examples is **-0.67490273**, I will stick with that for consistency.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is **-0.67490273**.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.259656303263545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property value = **0.51982952**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4-chlorobiphenyl with another Cl): Property value = **0.51982952** (same as above, likely a duplicate entry).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property value = **-0.40404929** (lower due to the polar -OH group).
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure): Property value = **1.23273879** (higher due to more Cl atoms and larger size).

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs.
   - For example, **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform) = **-1.05620406**, while **CI** (iodomethane) = **-1.11073232**. Halogen size doesn't always linearly increase the property, but for aromatics, bromine tends to increase it slightly compared to chlorine.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted benzenes (para-substitution) tend to have moderate property values unless other functional groups dominate (e.g., phenol lowers it).
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, but with bromine instead of chlorine.

### Prediction:
- The property value for **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** is **0.51982952**.
- Replacing Cl with Br (more polarizable halogen) would likely **increase the property value slightly** due to increased size and polarizability.
- However, the effect is not drastic (as seen in other examples where halogen changes don't cause huge jumps).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** to be:  
**~0.55 to 0.60**.  

A reasonable specific prediction would be:  
**0.57**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that brominated analogs of chlorinated aromatics tend to have slightly higher values in the given data.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.2986934902755072
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value tends to increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, particularly with the presence of multiple halogen atoms (Cl, Br) and aromatic systems. 

Let's analyze the given molecule:
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each ring is heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (6 Cl atoms total). The molecule is highly symmetrical and aromatic, similar to the second example in the list:
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 2.07755746), which has 10 Cl atoms.

The given molecule has fewer Cl atoms (6 vs. 10) but is still a large, aromatic, and heavily chlorinated system. Comparing this to other examples:
- The second example (10 Cl) has a value of ~2.08.
- The molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, no halogens) has a value of ~1.52.
- The molecule **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (another polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of ~1.55.

Given that the given molecule is smaller than the second example but still heavily chlorinated and aromatic, its property value should be slightly lower than 2.07755746 but higher than the purely aromatic systems (~1.5). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **1.8 to 1.9**. 

For a precise prediction, I would assign:  
**Predicted property value: 1.85**  

This is based on interpolation between the heavily chlorinated examples and the aromatic systems without halogens.

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 2.1183467716712046
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring), which are common in the examples. Aromaticity often contributes positively to the property value, especially with substitutions.
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(...)...)**: The presence of a phosphate ester (P=O with aryloxy groups) is a significant polar and bulky functional group. Similar phosphate-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a value of **1.86768394**) have high property values due to their polarity and complexity.
3. **Methyl substitutions**: The molecule has multiple methyl groups (`C` attached to aromatic rings), which are hydrophobic but not as impactful as polar groups. Methylated aromatics in the examples (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1`) have modest negative values, but here they are outweighed by the phosphate group.
4. **Bulkiness**: The molecule is large and branched, similar to some high-value examples like `CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (value: **1.77303098**), suggesting a higher property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The phosphate group is analogous to the thiophosphate in `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (value: **1.86768394**), though the latter has additional polar groups (C=O, Cl).
- The aromaticity and substitutions resemble `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` (value: **1.79514932**), which also has polar groups (amide, Cl).
- The size and branching are comparable to `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` (value: **1.32989469**), but the phosphate here adds more polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the phosphate group's strong contribution and the molecule's size/aromaticity, the property value should be **high**, similar to other phosphate-containing or highly polar aromatic compounds in the examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.75**  
*(Likely in the range of 1.7 to 1.8 based on the examples.)*  

### Refined Estimate:
Considering the exact structure, I would predict:  
**1.782**  
*(This balances the phosphate's polarity, aromaticity, and bulkiness, aligning with similar examples.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.7433059566144681
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and hydrophobic group. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with CF3) tend to have positive property values (~0.5–1.0 range).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The presence of a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a complex heterocyclic attachment (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O) suggests moderate polarity and bulkiness.
3. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a high value of 1.493). Here, there are two Cl atoms, which will contribute positively.
4. **Ketone (C=O) and heterocycle**: The N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O moiety introduces polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential, which may increase the property value slightly.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, F) and polar groups tend to have property values in the **0.5–1.5 range** (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` = 1.232, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` = 1.493).
- The CF3 group alone (e.g., in `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`) contributes to a value of ~0.509.
- The presence of a ketone and heterocycle (similar to `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3`) gives a higher value (1.802).

### Synthesis of Features:
- The molecule has **CF3 + 2 Cl + ketone + aromatic + heterocycle**, which combines features from multiple high-value examples.
- It lacks extremely bulky polycyclic systems (which push values >1.5), but the combined electronegativity and polarity suggest a value **between 1.0 and 1.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is **1.25**. This aligns with the trends observed for similar halogenated, polar, and moderately bulky molecules in the dataset.

---
**Final Answer:**  
Predicted property value: **1.25**

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.34491159324527004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group tend to have property values in the range of **-0.34 to 1.55**, depending on other substituents and the overall structure.
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.34093177** (two nitro groups, but no other polar groups).
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has a value of **1.24955588** (nitro group with additional polar/aromatic features).

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - The methoxy group (`OCH3`) is moderately polar and often appears in molecules with property values around **-0.5 to 0.5** unless combined with other strongly polar/charged groups.

3. **Aromatic Ring with Nitro and Methoxy Substituents**:
   - The molecule `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` is **p-nitrophenyl methyl ether** (or a similar derivative), where:
     - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, increasing polarity.
     - The methoxy group is electron-donating, but less polar than the nitro group.
   - Similar structures:
     - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a value of **-0.79348128**.
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.34093177**.
     - The methoxy group is less polar than a hydroxyl group, but the nitro group dominates.

4. **Combined Effect**:
   - The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature likely outweighs the methoxy group's donating effect, leading to a moderately positive property value.
   - No additional bulky or hydrophobic groups are present to significantly lower the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- Nitro-aromatic systems with moderate polarity (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` has **0.49653744**).
- The methoxy group slightly reduces the polarity compared to a nitro group alone, but not drastically. 

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**0.45** (approximate, based on structural analogs in the dataset).

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.2706326225845856
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule is heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (8 Cl atoms), similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane, property = **0.36234664**). This suggests that high halogenation tends to increase the property value compared to less halogenated analogs (e.g., **ClCCCl** with property = **-1.05258958**).

2. **Polycyclic Framework**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple fused rings. Examples like **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (property = **1.55116357**) and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (property = **0.12145847**) show that polycyclic systems with bulky substituents tend to have higher property values.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: The chlorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing, which may influence the property similarly to nitro groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, property = **-0.34093177**), but the sheer number of Cl atoms here likely dominates.

4. **Steric Crowding**: The molecule is highly sterically crowded, which often correlates with higher property values in the examples (e.g., **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, property = **2.00149774**).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (6 Cl atoms): **0.36234664**  
- **Clc1ccccc1** (1 Cl atom): **-0.66346851**  
- **ClCCCl** (2 Cl atoms): **-1.05258958**  

The given molecule has **8 Cl atoms** and a more complex polycyclic structure, so its property value should be significantly higher than **0.36234664** but likely less than **2.00149774** (due to no carbonyl or other polar groups).

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is **~1.2 to 1.6**. Splitting the difference and considering the high halogenation and polycyclic nature, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 1.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1.0188932150947851
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -1.142602  
   - **CCCI** (iodopropane): -0.75184859  
   - **CC(Cl)Cl** (1,1-dichloropropane): -0.87400275  
   - **CC(Cl)CCl** (1,2-dichloropropane): -0.87400275  
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -1.44719067  
   These suggest that simple hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, with more electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, I, CN) lowering the value further.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): -0.06653768  
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenylethanol): -0.4448969  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol): -0.40125098  
   Oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, esters) tend to reduce the property value but not as drastically as halogens or nitriles.

3. **Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 1.35853465 (complex ester with aromatic rings)  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.06653768 (simpler ester)  
   Simpler esters (like ethyl formate analogs) seem to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative.

4. **Formates**:
   - The molecule **CCCOC=O** is propyl formate, a simple ester. The closest analog in the examples is **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with an aromatic ring), which has a value of -0.06653768. Since propyl formate lacks the aromatic ring and is simpler, its value might be slightly more negative.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
Given that:
- Simple esters like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate have a value around -0.066,  
- Propyl formate is even simpler (no aromaticity or additional substituents),  
- The presence of the formate group (O=CO) is not strongly electron-withdrawing or donating,  

The property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely **slightly negative**, similar to other simple esters but not as low as halogenated or nitrile-containing compounds.  

### Final Prediction:
**-0.25** (estimated based on trends; exact value may vary but should fall in the range of -0.1 to -0.4 for simple esters).  

However, looking at the examples more closely, **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is -0.066, and **CC(O)c1ccccc1** is -0.444. Since propyl formate is simpler than these, a reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted property value for CCCOC=O: -0.15**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)  

---  
**Update**: After re-evaluating, since **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) is -0.066 and **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenylethanol) is -0.444, propyl formate (lacking aromaticity or polar N) might be closer to **-0.20**.  

**Final refined prediction: -0.20**
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.41664170046184207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes)**:
   - **CC** (ethane): -1.44481988 (very low)
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 0.22406331
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.45305087
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains tend to have higher (less negative) values than very short chains.

2. **Esters (R-COO-R')**:
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**: 1.09729264 (complex ester)
   - **CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C**: 2.36302432 (very high, but complex)
   - Esters generally seem to have higher property values than simple hydrocarbons.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (**O-H**) and ethers (**O-R**) often have negative or modestly positive values (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**: -0.72877804).
   - Carbonyl groups (**C=O**) can increase the value, especially in esters or amides.

4. **Polar vs. Nonpolar**:
   - Nonpolar molecules (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32**: 0.50257325) tend to have modest positive values.
   - Polar groups (e.g., **Cl**, **Br**, **NO2**) can either increase or decrease the value depending on context.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **decyl acetate** (CH₃(CH₂)₈COOCH₂CH₃), a long-chain ester.
- Structural features:
   - Long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**): Likely contributes a modest positive value (similar to hexylbenzene: 0.22406331).
   - Ester group (**C(=O)OCC**): Likely increases the value further (as esters tend to have higher values than hydrocarbons alone).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 0.22406331 (hydrocarbon + aromatic)
- **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**: 1.09729264 (complex ester)
- **CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C**: 2.36302432 (very complex ester with multiple polar groups)

Given that **decyl acetate** is a simpler ester with a long hydrocarbon chain, its value should be:
- Higher than hexylbenzene (0.22406331) due to the ester group.
- Lower than very complex esters (e.g., 1.09729264 or 2.36302432) because it lacks additional polar or aromatic features.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.6 to 0.9**. Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**0.75** (midway between simple hydrocarbons and complex esters).

### Final Answer:
**0.75**

True Property: 1.191362614631118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings, each substituted with electronegative groups (Cl, NO₂, and OH). 
   - Similar examples:
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (1.24955588): Contains aromatic rings with Cl and O substitutions, similar to our molecule.
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (0.82122345): Contains multiple Cl and O substitutions on aromatic rings.
     - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-0.40484214): Contains a NO₂ group on an aromatic ring.

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: This is a polar functional group that can increase the property value.
   - Similar example:
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (1.24955588): Contains an amide linkage.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.
   - Similar example:
     - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-0.40484214): Contains a nitro group, but the value is lower due to fewer aromatic substitutions.

4. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: This is a polar group that can contribute to the property value.
   - Similar example:
     - **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (-0.1131024): Contains a hydroxyl group.

### Comparison and Prediction:
- The molecule combines multiple electronegative substituents (Cl, NO₂, OH) and an amide linkage, which are features seen in molecules with higher property values (e.g., 1.24955588 for **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**).
- The presence of two aromatic rings with multiple substitutions (Cl and NO₂) suggests a higher value than simpler substituted aromatics (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** with -0.40484214).
- The amide linkage and additional Cl substitution likely push the value higher than **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (0.82122345).

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.4**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.35**  

This is based on the combination of structural features and their contributions in the provided examples.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2.5785722076297204
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Complexity**: The molecule is large and contains multiple functional groups, including:
   - Two **phosphorothioate (P=S)** groups (similar to the example with **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a high value of **1.79994143**).
   - A **thioether (S)** linkage between two aromatic rings (similar to **CCSSCC**, which has a value of **-0.47644788**, but this is a simpler aliphatic thioether).
   - Two **aromatic rings** connected via a sulfur atom (similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, which has a value of **0.9092615**).

2. **Polarity and Size**: The molecule is highly polar due to the **P=S** and **O-aryl** groups, and its large size suggests it would have a higher property value (similar to other large, polar molecules in the examples).

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = **1.79994143** (contains P=S, aromatic rings, and polar groups).
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = **0.9092615** (two aromatic rings linked directly).
   - **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **1.29869349** (multiple aromatic rings and halogens).

4. **Unique Features**: The given molecule has **two P=S groups** and a **thioether-linked biphenyl system**, which likely increases its property value further due to additive effects of polarity and size.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of **two P=S groups** and the **large aromatic system**, the property value should be **higher than 1.79994143** (the highest value in the examples for a single P=S group). However, the thioether linkage may slightly reduce the value compared to a fully conjugated system. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = 1.85** (slightly higher than the highest P=S-containing example due to the second P=S group and extended conjugation).

### Final Answer:
**1.85**

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5348549070667006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = 0.82043059  
     This molecule has a nitrophenyl group (N(=O)=O attached to a phenyl ring with additional substitutions (Cl and O-linkages). The property is moderately positive.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.41545242  
     Here, the nitro group is directly attached to a toluene-like structure (methyl-substituted benzene). The property is negative but less so than simpler aliphatic molecules.

2. **Hydroxy Group (OH) Influence**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = -0.46242911  
     A hydroxy group on a benzene ring with an amide substituent gives a negative property.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.2093333  
     A tri-chlorinated phenol has a slightly negative property.

3. **Combined OH and NO2 on Benzene**:
   - The target molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a nitrophenol (hydroxy and nitro groups on benzene).  
     From the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property slightly (compared to pure hydrocarbons), while hydroxy groups may decrease it or have a neutral effect. 

### Comparison with Similar Structures:
- **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (0.82043059) has a similar nitro-phenyl-ether linkage but with additional chlorines, which likely increase the property further.  
- **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.41545242) is simpler (no OH), and the property is more negative.  
- The presence of OH in **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** may not fully counteract the nitro group's effect, but it will reduce the property compared to the chlorinated nitro example.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the electron-withdrawing nitro group (increasing property) and the hydroxy group (decreasing or moderating the property), and considering the examples, the property for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely **slightly positive but lower than the chlorinated nitro example**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.15**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 2.0502272664054444
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a highly branched oligosaccharide with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (O-), which contribute to significant hydrogen bonding and polarity. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, sugars) tend to have moderately negative to positive values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has -0.72070957).
- Larger, more complex polar molecules (e.g., steroids, glycosides) often have positive values (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` has 1.32989469).

The given molecule is even more polar and complex than most examples, with 10 hydroxyl groups and a highly branched structure. This suggests a higher positive value due to increased polarity and size. 

**Predicted property value: ~1.45**  
(Reasoning: Similar to large glycosides/steroids in the examples but with additional polarity from more -OH groups, likely placing it between 1.3 and 1.6.)

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1.1426019988346792
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene), with a property value of **-0.49168315**. Alkynes are generally polarizable due to the triple bond, but the presence of aromatic rings and cyano groups in this example complicates direct comparison.
   
2. **Hydrocarbons**:
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (a branched aromatic): **-0.30586734**
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone): **-0.89133675**
   - **CCCCCC=O** (an aldehyde): **-0.71189489**
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (an alcohol): **-0.49359533**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long-chain alcohol): **0.94279463**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (a non-polar alkene): **-0.01293831**

   Non-polar hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes) tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative, while polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, alcohols) push the value more negative or positive depending on the specific group.

3. **CCC#C** is a small, non-polar alkyne with no other functional groups. Compared to:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (non-polar alkene): **-0.01293831**
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (polar alkyne): **-0.49168315**

   The triple bond in **CCC#C** is more polarizable than a double bond but less polar than a cyano group. Thus, its property value should be between these two examples but closer to the alkene due to the lack of strong polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCC#C** is likely to have a property value slightly more negative than **CCCCCCCCC=C** but less negative than **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCC#C: -0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

This reflects its intermediate polarity due to the alkyne bond but lack of other functional groups.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1.167095016589274
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**:  
   - Present in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **1.79994143**) and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property = **1.1287348**).  
   - This group tends to increase the property value significantly (observed range: **1.13–1.80**).

2. **Aromatic Ring with Multiple Chlorines**:  
   - The **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** fragment resembles **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = **0.82043059**) and **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property = **0.82122345**).  
   - Such fragments typically contribute values in the **0.8–1.3** range when combined with other polar groups.

3. **Ethoxy and Ethyl Groups (CCO and CC)**:  
   - These are less polar and may slightly reduce the property compared to purely aromatic/charged systems.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is structurally closest to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **1.79994143**), but with fewer polar substituents (no amide/carbonyl) and simpler alkyl chains.  
- The **P=S** group is a strong contributor, but the lack of additional polar groups (like carbonyls) suggests a slightly lower value than **1.799**.  
- The aromatic chlorines add to the property, but not as much as nitro or amide groups would.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the **P=S** group (high contribution) and the simpler alkyl/aryl chlorines (moderate contribution), the predicted value is likely in the range of **1.4–1.6**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 1.50051409** (similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C**, which has comparable complexity and halogenation).

### Final Answer:
**1.50051409**

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.4909602478282977
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - **C(=O)NN**: This is a hydrazide (carbonyl + hydrazine), which is strongly polar and likely to increase the property value due to its ability to participate in interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding).
   - **Aromatic nitrogen (n)**: The pyridine nitrogen adds polarity and basicity.

3. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., amides, nitro, or multiple halogens) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** has a value of **0.41371513**).
   - Simple aromatic systems with less polar substituents (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl**) have lower values (e.g., **-0.46875252**).
   - The hydrazide group is more polar than a simple amide or halogen, so we expect a higher value than most simple substituted aromatics but not as high as large polyaromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** has **1.52077077**).

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: **-0.00631564**): Less polar than our molecule.
   - **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2** (property: **-0.37315124**): Similar polarity but less conjugated.
   - **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1** (property: **0.59749827**): Similar polarity due to multiple H-bonding groups.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity of the hydrazide group and the aromatic pyridine ring, the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to molecules with amide or multiple polar substituents. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- The hydrazide group being more polar than a simple amide but less than large conjugated systems.
- The pyridine ring contributing to polarity but not as much as polyaromatic systems.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data where polar/aromatic features correlate with higher values.)

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.7773994561329638
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group. In the examples, molecules with P(=S) or similar polar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have property values around **0.70896443**. This suggests that P(=S) contributes positively to the property.
2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: This is another polar group. Molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** have a value of **-0.61224383**, but this is a simple amide. Here, the amide is part of a larger cyclic structure (piperidine ring), which may reduce its negative contribution.
3. **Alkyl chains (CCCO, OCCC, CCCCC1C)**: These are non-polar and typically reduce the property value (e.g., **CCCCCCCI** has **-0.03408113**). However, their effect is mitigated by the polar groups.
4. **Thioether linkage (SCC)**: This is moderately polar but less so than P(=S) or amide. Its contribution is likely neutral to slightly positive.
5. **Cyclic structure (N1CCCCC1C)**: The piperidine ring with an amide is somewhat analogous to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**, but the ring structure may stabilize the molecule and slightly increase the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** has a value of **0.70896443**. It contains P(=S) and a nitro group, which is highly polar.
- The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** has a value of **1.24955588**, featuring an amide and aromatic rings with polar substituents.
- The molecule **Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O** has a value of **0.57461428**, with multiple polar groups (amides, nitrogens).

Our molecule has:
- One P(=S) group (similar to the first example but without nitro).
- One amide group (less polar than the second example but with a cyclic structure).
- Alkyl chains (reducing the value slightly).

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of polar (P(=S), amide) and non-polar (alkyl) groups, the property value is likely between **0.7 and 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This is based on:
- The strong contribution from P(=S) (~0.7).
- The moderate contribution from the amide and cyclic structure (~0.1-0.2).
- The slight reduction from alkyl chains (~-0.05 to -0.1). 

Thus, **0.85** is a plausible prediction.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.3681686891265001
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular weight. The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups, no polarity, and no aromaticity. 

From the examples:
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.49274029** (due to the presence of a polar -OH group).
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (an alkene) has a value of **-0.55126391** (slightly lower due to the double bond introducing minor polarity).
- **CCCCCC** (hexane) would likely have an even lower value than heptanol due to lack of polarity, but it isn't in the examples. However, **CCC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol) has **-0.8543446**, and **CC(C)CO** (another branched alcohol) has **-1.03378646**, showing that non-polar or less polar molecules trend toward more negative values.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is purely non-polar and lacks any functional groups, its property value should be more negative than **CCCCCCCO** but less negative than highly branched or smaller alkanes like **CC(C)CO**. 

A reasonable estimate, based on the trend, would be around **-0.65 to -0.75**. 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-0.70** (a middle-ground value for a long, non-polar alkane). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.508473738819163
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, a ketone, and an alkyne group. 

Breaking it down:
1. **Core structure**: The molecule has a fused polycyclic (steroid-like) framework, which is associated with higher property values in the examples (e.g., `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` has a value of 1.99852065, and `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has 1.32896192).
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - A ketone (`C=O`) is present, which is common in high-value examples.
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`OH`), which increase polarity and likely the property value.
   - An alkyne (`C#C`), which is less common in the examples but may contribute slightly due to its unsaturation.
3. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - The closest analog is `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (value = 1.32896192), but the new molecule has an additional hydroxyl group and an alkyne, which would likely increase the value further.
   - Another similar example is `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (value = 1.99852065), which has more polar groups (extra hydroxyl and carbonyl).

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C` would likely be **between 1.4 and 1.6**. A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**. 

### Final predicted value: **1.5** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

(Note: If higher precision is needed, a more exact value might be **1.52**, interpolating between the closest examples.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3.490993473916635
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, aromaticity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is highly complex, with multiple aromatic rings, oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls), and fused ring systems. 

Here’s a breakdown of the features that likely influence the property:
1. **High aromaticity**: The presence of multiple fused aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...c67`) tends to increase the property value (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` have high values ~1.52).
2. **Oxygen-rich functional groups**: Ethers (`OC`), alcohols (`O`), and carbonyls (`C=O`) add polarity and complexity. Examples like `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br` (value ~0.40) or `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (value ~2.70) suggest oxygenated structures can have high values.
3. **Fused ring systems**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings (e.g., `C6C2C...c7cc5OCOc5cc67`), similar to the high-value examples (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` with ~1.45).
4. **Size and branching**: The large size and branching (e.g., `C6C2C(COC2=O)...`) resemble the highest-value example (~2.70), which is also a large, branched polycyclic structure.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** would likely be **~2.5 to 3.0**, leaning toward the higher end due to its extreme complexity and oxygen content. 

**Final predicted value: ~2.85** (interpolating between the highest examples).

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.5987652821788221
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a property value of **-0.53485491**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another entry for nitrophenol) also has the same value of **-0.53485491**.
   - These suggest that the presence of an **-OH group on benzene** with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., **-NO2**) leads to a negative property value around **-0.53**.

2. **Chlorobenzene Derivatives**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a property value of **-0.16921636**.
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.85981686**.
   - **ClC=C** (chloroethene) has a property value of **-1.26207445**.
   - This suggests that **halogen substituents** on aromatic or aliphatic systems tend to yield negative property values, with the magnitude depending on the halogen and substitution pattern.

3. **Combined -OH and -Cl on Benzene**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **4-chlorophenol**, which combines an **-OH group** and a **-Cl group** on the benzene ring.
   - The **-OH group** is electron-donating (resonance effect), while the **-Cl group** is weakly electron-withdrawing (inductive effect) but electron-donating via resonance.
   - Compared to nitrophenol (-0.53), the **-Cl group is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2**, so we expect a less negative value than -0.53.
   - Compared to chlorobenzene derivatives (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1I** with -0.17), the addition of **-OH** would likely make the property more negative.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Phenol with a strong electron-withdrawing group (**-NO2**) gives ~**-0.53**.
- Chlorobenzene derivatives give moderately negative values (e.g., **-0.17** for chloroiodobenzene).
- The combination of **-OH** and **-Cl** would likely result in a value between these, but closer to the phenol derivatives because the **-OH** dominates the electronic effects.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is around **-0.45 to -0.50**. 

Looking at the examples, **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O** (a sugar derivative) has a value of **-0.48639744**, which is close to what we might expect for **4-chlorophenol**. 

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is approximately **-0.48**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)

   - Two **chlorine atoms (Cl)** attached to the aromatic ring and the alkyne chain.
   - An **alkyne group (C#C)** in the chain.
   - An **ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**.
   - A **substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)** with one Cl substituent.
   - The molecule has moderate polarity due to the Cl atoms and the polar OC(=O)N group.

2. **Comparison with Given Examples**:
   - Molecules with **multiple Cl atoms** (e.g., `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`) tend to have **higher property values (~1.27)** due to their electronegativity and bulkiness.
   - Molecules with **ester/amide groups** (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3`) also have **higher values (~1.98)** due to polarity and conjugation.
   - The **alkyne group** is less common in the examples, but it adds some rigidity and slight polarity.
   - The **aromatic ring with Cl** (similar to `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) has a **low value (~0.017)**, but the additional polar groups here will increase it.

3. **Estimated Property Value**:
   - The presence of **two Cl atoms** and the **polar OC(=O)N group** suggests a **higher value than simple aromatic Cl-substituted molecules**.
   - The **alkyne group** may slightly increase the value due to rigidity.
   - Compared to `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F` (value = **1.193**), this molecule has fewer electronegative substituents but similar polar groups.
   - A reasonable estimate would be **slightly lower than 1.193**, around **0.8–1.0**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the structural similarities and trends in the examples, the predicted property value for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is approximately:

**0.923**

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1.4968607370656342
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, aromaticity, and the presence of halogens (Cl, Br), heteroatoms (N, O, S), and functional groups.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Central oxygen (O) attached to a carbon**: This is likely an alcohol or ether, contributing to polarity.
2. **Two aromatic rings (c1ccc(Cl)cc1 and c3ccccc3Cl)**: Both are substituted with chlorine (Cl), which increases lipophilicity and may slightly increase the property value (Cl substitution often raises the value, as seen in examples like Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.468) vs. unsubstituted aromatics).
3. **Heterocyclic aromatic ring (c2cncnc2)**: This is a pyrimidine-like ring with nitrogens, which can contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles in the examples (e.g., Nc1nc[nH]n1) tend to lower the property value, but here it's part of a larger conjugated system.
4. **Multiple Cl substitutions**: The presence of two Cl atoms on aromatic rings (one on each) suggests a higher property value than single Cl substitutions (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 has -0.468, but Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has 1.419).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: This has multiple Cl substitutions and a central carbon with Cl, giving a high value of **1.419**.
- **ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: Similar Cl-substituted aromatics with a central linker, value **1.247**.
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**: This is structurally similar but with a central O instead of C and a heterocycle. The O and N may slightly reduce the value compared to the purely Cl-substituted cases, but the overall complexity and Cl substitutions suggest a high value.

### Predicted property value:
Given the above, the predicted value is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.4**. A reasonable estimate is **1.30**.

### Final answer:
**1.30**

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8394513506502074
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Carbonyl-containing compounds (C=O)**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (ethyl acetoacetate): -0.66000949  
     (Note: This is actually ethyl acetoacetate, but the value is closer to simpler esters.)
   - **CCCC=O** (pentanal): -0.71189489  
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (furan-2-carbaldehyde): -0.94938233  
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -0.04363815  

   Esters and aldehydes tend to have negative values, with aldehydes being more negative than esters.

2. **Ether-containing compounds (C-O-C)**:
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1**: 0.08916516  
   - **CC(=O)OCC**: -0.66000949 (ethyl acetate, an ester)  

   Ethers alone (without other polar groups) may slightly increase the property value compared to esters.

3. **Chain length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCBr**: -0.77034855) tend to have more negative values than shorter ones.  
   - **CCCCOC=O** has a 4-carbon chain, which is moderately long.

4. **Specific comparison**:
   - **CCCC=O** (pentanal): -0.71189489  
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): -0.66000949  
   - **CCCCOC=O** is an ester (like ethyl acetate) but with a longer alkyl chain (butyl instead of ethyl). Longer chains typically reduce the property value slightly.  

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCCOC=O** is an ester with a butyl group, its value should be slightly more negative than ethyl acetate (-0.66000949) but less negative than pentanal (-0.71189489). A reasonable estimate would be between these two values.

**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: -0.68**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited dataset and structural trends. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.241747806978088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to the presence of halogens (Cl, Br) and the size/structure of the molecule.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Halogenated compounds**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): Property value = **-1.05258958**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): Property value = **0.11539546**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene): Property value = **-0.49197852**
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): Property value = **-1.12923228**
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C...** (a highly chlorinated compound): Property value = **1.55424949**

   Smaller, less substituted halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClCCCl, CCBr) tend to have **negative property values**, while larger or more substituted halogenated compounds (e.g., hexachlorobenzene) have **less negative or positive values**.

2. **Size and branching**:
   - Smaller molecules (e.g., **CCC**, **CCBr**) have more negative values.
   - Larger or more complex molecules (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO**) have more positive values.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a small, dihalogenated alkane (similar to ClCCCl but with only one carbon).
   - It is smaller and less substituted than ClCCCl, so we expect its property value to be **more negative** than ClCCCl (-1.05258958).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- ClCCCl (2 carbons, 2 Cl) has a value of **-1.05258958**,
- CCBr (2 carbons, 1 Br) has a value of **-1.12923228**,
- ClCCl (1 carbon, 2 Cl) is smaller and simpler than both, so its value should be **more negative**.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is **-1.2 to -1.3**. Averaging the trend, we predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -1.25**  

(Note: Without a direct example of ClCCl, this is an approximate extrapolation based on the given data.)

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.4252698342947853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted phenol (benzene ring with an -OH group) with two methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 1 and 2 (ortho to the -OH group).
   - The -OH group is a polar, hydrogen-bonding donor/acceptor, which often increases the property value (as seen in other phenolic examples).
   - The methyl groups are weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic, which may slightly decrease the property value.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property: -0.06179998): This is a very similar structure with two methyl groups (one isopropyl and one methyl) on the benzene ring with an -OH group. The property is close to zero but slightly negative.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property: 0.28301056): A nitrogen-containing aromatic system with some similarity in ring substitution.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (property: -0.72877804): A dihydroxybenzene, where the additional -OH group significantly lowers the property compared to monophenols.

3. **Trends**:
   - Phenols with simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., methyl) tend to have property values slightly below zero or slightly above, depending on the substitution pattern.
   - The presence of electron-donating groups (like -OH or -CH3) can increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but multiple alkyl groups may offset this.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property: -0.06179998), but with slightly less steric bulk (two simple methyl groups instead of an isopropyl group), the property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is likely slightly higher (closer to zero or slightly positive). 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.05**

### Rationale:
- The -OH group contributes a positive increment to the property.
- The two methyl groups are weakly negative contributors but less so than bulkier alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl).
- The balance between these effects places the value just above zero. 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where simple substituted phenols hover around zero.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.9092615037616085
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have **higher property values** (e.g., >1.0). 
   - Example:  
     - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **1.1039775**  
     - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** → **1.29869349**  
   - The target molecule is a **bis-chlorinated biphenyl** with **5 chlorine atoms**, similar to these examples.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**: 
   - The target molecule has a **symmetrical biphenyl core** with chlorines at multiple positions, which aligns with the higher-property trend seen in other polychlorinated aromatics.

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**: 
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.29869349) is structurally very similar but has **one additional chlorine**.  
   - The molecule **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.1039775) has **one fewer chlorine** than the target.  

### Prediction:
Given the **5 chlorines** and **symmetrical biphenyl structure**, the property value should lie between the two closest examples:  
- **Lower bound**: 1.1039775 (4 chlorines)  
- **Upper bound**: 1.29869349 (6 chlorines)  

A reasonable estimate is slightly closer to the lower bound due to fewer chlorines than the 6-Cl example.  

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**1.18** (approximate, likely between 1.15 and 1.25 based on interpolation).  

For precision, I would predict:  
**1.19** (similar to the trend observed in the given data).  

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is:  
**1.19** (rounded to two decimal places).  

*(Note: If the property is logP, this aligns with the increased hydrophobicity of polychlorinated aromatics.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.9101476364255348
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = -0.01293831  
     This is a linear alkene with one double bond and a long hydrocarbon chain. The value is close to zero but slightly negative.
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = -0.35573174  
     Branched structure with a polar C=O group, more negative than nonene.
   - **CC(C)=CC3C(...)**: Property = 2.11517924 (complex structure with rings and polar groups, not directly comparable).  
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a simpler branched alkene (isobutylene), similar to nonene but more branched.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (highly branched hydrocarbon): Property = -0.19416799  
     Branched hydrocarbons tend to have slightly more negative values than linear ones (e.g., **CCCCCCCC** = -0.36816869).  
   - **CC=C(C)C** is less branched than the above but more branched than nonene.

3. **Double Bonds**:
   - The presence of a double bond (as in nonene) seems to reduce the magnitude of the property compared to saturated analogs (e.g., **CCCCCCCC** = -0.36816869 vs. **CCCCCCCCC=C** = -0.01293831).  
   - **CC=C(C)C** has one double bond and branching, likely placing it between nonene and branched saturated hydrocarbons.

4. **Smaller Molecules**:
   - Smaller hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCOC(=O)C=C**) tend to have more negative values, but this also depends on functional groups.  
   - **CC=C(C)C** is small and branched, so it may have a moderately negative value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Linear alkene (**CCCCCCCCC=C**) = -0.01293831  
- Branched saturated hydrocarbon (**CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) = -0.19416799  
- **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene, likely closer to the linear alkene but slightly more negative due to branching.  

A reasonable estimate is **-0.10 to -0.20**. Splitting the difference, I predict:  
**Property value for CC=C(C)C ≈ -0.15**.  

### Final Answer:
**-0.15** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend suggests smaller/branched molecules have more negative values.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.241747806978088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorine (Cl) Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have moderately negative to positive property values, depending on other structural features.
   - Example: `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **-0.7028781**, while `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high value of **1.68812548**. This suggests that simply having Cl atoms does not always lead to negative values; aromaticity and additional functional groups play a role.

2. **Small Aliphatic Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene): **-0.7028781**
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex chlorinated hydrocarbon): **1.27063262**
   - The simplest chlorinated molecule in the data is `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, which is negative. Smaller, less complex chlorinated molecules tend to have negative values unless they are part of aromatic systems or have other functional groups.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a very small, non-aromatic molecule with two Cl atoms. It lacks additional functional groups or complexity that might drive the property value positive (like aromaticity or large hydrophobic regions).
   - Comparing to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (-0.7028781), which has more Cl atoms but is similarly aliphatic, we might expect **ClCCl** to have a less negative value because it has fewer Cl atoms and is less sterically hindered.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **ClCCl** and the trend for small aliphatic chlorinated compounds to have negative values, I predict its property value to be **moderately negative**, but less negative than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where small, non-aromatic chlorinated molecules have negative values, but the magnitude depends on the number of Cl atoms and molecular complexity.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.20933329566492248
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Rings**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is a chlorinated phenol (trichlorophenol). 
   - From the examples, **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (a similar trichlorophenol) has a property value of **-0.2093333**. 
   - Another chlorinated aromatic, **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (tribromobenzene), has a value of **0.0396078**, suggesting halogens on aromatic rings tend to give small-magnitude values (near zero).

2. **Oxygen Substituents**:
   - Phenolic -OH groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc(CC=C)cc1**) tend to slightly reduce the property value (e.g., **-0.06326909**).
   - The presence of -OH in **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is similar, but the additional Cl substituents may further lower the value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest match is **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** with **-0.2093333**. 
   - The target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** has the same substituents but a slightly different substitution pattern (1,2,4-trichlorophenol vs. 1,2,3-trichlorophenol in the example). This minor difference is unlikely to drastically change the property value.

4. **General Trend**:
   - Heavily halogenated aromatics with polar groups (e.g., -OH) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.2 to 0.2**, with electronegative substituents pulling the value slightly negative.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.2093333) and the structural consistency, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is approximately:

**-0.21** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

For higher precision (matching the format of the examples), the value is likely very close to the provided example, so:

**Predicted value: -0.209** (similar to the given trichlorophenol). 

However, since the substitution pattern is slightly different (1,2,4 vs. 1,2,3), the value might be marginally lower. Thus, a reasonable estimate is:

**-0.22** (to reflect the slightly increased steric/electronic effects of adjacent Cl groups). 

But given the data, the safest prediction is to align with the closest example:

**Final answer: -0.209** (same as the provided **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**). 

If forced to choose a distinct value, I would suggest **-0.21** as a slight adjustment. 

However, based on the examples, the most justifiable answer is:

**-0.2093333** (identical to the given trichlorophenol, as the structural difference is minimal). 

For the exact format:

**-0.209** (rounded). 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll provide:

**-0.2093333** (same as the closest analogue). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is:

**-0.2093333**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3.490993473916635
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule you've provided is highly complex, with multiple functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls, and cyclic structures) and a large size. 

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Large, complex molecules** (e.g., steroids, polycyclic structures) tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` has a value of **1.81188867**).
2. **Small, nonpolar, or simple molecules** (e.g., `C#C`, `CCCCl`) have **negative values**.
3. **Polar functional groups** (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl, multiple hydroxyls) increase the value, especially when combined with aromaticity or size.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
- **Structure**: The molecule is a **highly oxygenated polycyclic system** with multiple ethers (OCH3), hydroxyls (OH), a carbonyl (C=O), and fused rings. It resembles a glycosidic or flavonoid-like structure.
- **Size**: Very large (similar to steroids/polysaccharides in the examples).
- **Polarity**: High due to many O-containing groups.
- **Comparable examples**:
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (value: **0.78105987**) – a sugar derivative.
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (value: **1.70113764**) – a steroid-like molecule.

Given its **size, polarity, and functional group density**, the predicted value should be **higher than most sugars but slightly lower than large steroids** due to less rigidity/compactness.

### Predicted property value:
**1.45**  
*(Rationale: Between sugar-like (~0.78) and steroid-like (~1.70) values, leaning closer to the latter due to complexity.)*

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3264893615479044
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like moiety** (with N and C=O groups). This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic systems in the examples (e.g., `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` or `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`), which tend to have negative or modestly positive values.
2. **Substituents**:
   - A **thioether (S-CH3)** group, which is moderately polar but less electronegative than oxygen.
   - A **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - A **secondary amide (N-H)** and a **carbonyl (C=O)** group, both polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` has a value of **-0.564**, featuring a similar pyrimidone-like ring with polar groups.
   - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **0.645**, with a tert-butyl group and polar heterocycles.
   - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a value of **-0.456**, another polar heterocycle.

### Key Observations:
- The **tert-butyl group** increases hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar **C=O and N-H** groups.
- The **thioether (S-CH3)** is less polar than an oxygen analog, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to oxygen-containing analogs.
- The overall structure is **moderately polar** but not as polar as some of the highly positive examples (e.g., those with multiple aromatic rings or long aliphatic chains).

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance between polar groups and hydrophobic substituents, the property value is likely **positive but modest**, similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (0.645) but slightly lower due to the less polar thioether. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.55**  
*(Likely in the range of 0.50 to 0.60 based on structural analogs.)*

To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CC** (ethane) has a low value (-1.4448), indicating that small, non-polar hydrocarbons tend to have negative values.
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene) has a slightly higher but still negative value (-0.5513).

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly listed, but aromatic systems with simple substitutions tend to have values around -0.6 to 0.2.
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has a value of 0.1724, suggesting that linking two aromatic rings increases the property slightly.

3. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - **COCC(=O)OC** (an ester) has a value of -0.4806.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) is structurally similar to the above but with an aromatic ring. The aromatic ring may slightly increase the property compared to purely aliphatic esters.

4. **Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (a nitro-substituted toluene) has a value of -0.4155.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an ester-substituted benzene, which is somewhat analogous but with a less electron-withdrawing group (ester vs. nitro). Esters are less polar than nitro groups, so the value might be slightly lower.

5. **Other Esters**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a value of -0.4806.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) replaces the aliphatic chain with an aromatic ring, which typically increases the property slightly due to conjugation and polarizability.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** and **COCC(=O)OC** have values around **-0.48 to -0.49**.
- Aromatic rings tend to increase the property slightly (e.g., **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is 0.1724 vs. simpler aromatics).
- The ester group in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is conjugated with the aromatic ring, which may increase the property slightly compared to aliphatic esters.

Thus, the property for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely slightly higher than -0.48 but still negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35** (approximately between the aliphatic ester and more polar aromatic systems). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** has a very high value (1.8008), but this is due to the complex polar substituents. The simpler **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be much lower. 

Given the closest analogies, a refined estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.40** (between the aliphatic ester and nitro-substituted toluene). 

But to be more precise, since **COCC(=O)OC** is -0.4806 and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** has an aromatic ring, the value is likely slightly higher (less negative). 

Final prediction: **-0.45**. 

However, considering the examples more carefully, the most likely value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.42**. 

But to match the trend more accurately, the value is probably closer to **-0.38**. 

After reconsidering, the best fit is:

**Predicted property value: -0.40**. 

This balances the ester's effect and the aromatic ring's contribution. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.40** (approximate, based on analogous examples). 

However, looking back at **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.4806) and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, the aromatic ring likely increases the value by ~0.1, so:

**Predicted property value: -0.38**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable single-point estimate is:

**-0.39**. 

But to be conservative, rounding to one decimal place:

**-0.4**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:

**-0.40**. 

### Exact Prediction:
After carefully comparing with the most similar examples (e.g., **COCC(=O)OC** at -0.4806 and **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** at -0.4155), the value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely:

**-0.42**. 

But to align with the ester trend, the final prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.41**. 

Given the data, the most precise estimate is:

**-0.41**. 

### Conclusion:
The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.41**.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.23202295571749862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane): Property value = -1.11073232
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property value = 0.71454551
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): Property value = 0.12145847
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (brominated heterocycle): Property value = 0.39793575

   Alkyl halides with simple linear structures (like CI) tend to have negative property values, while bulkier or aromatic halides (like bromonaphthalene) have less negative or positive values.

2. **Linear Alkanes and Derivatives**:
   - **CCCC** (butane-like fragments in other molecules): Tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.53245302 for CCCC(=O)CCC).
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): Property value = -0.49274029
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene): Property value = -0.37182204

   Longer linear chains tend to have less negative values compared to shorter ones, and the presence of functional groups (e.g., -OH, -Br) can shift the value.

3. **Brominated Linear Alkane**:
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear 7-carbon chain with a terminal bromine. Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CI** (iodomethane): -1.11073232 (very negative due to small size and halogen).
     - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): -0.49274029 (longer chain, -OH group).
     - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): 0.12145847 (aromatic bromine).

   The property value for **CCCCCCCBr** should be less negative than **CI** but more negative than **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** due to its linear, non-aromatic structure. It is also likely slightly more negative than **CCCCCCCO** because -Br is less polar than -OH.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Linear alkanes with halogens have negative values.
- Longer chains reduce the negativity compared to shorter ones.
- Bromine is less electronegative than iodine, so **CCCCCCCBr** will be less negative than **CI** (-1.11073232) but comparable to **CCCCCCCO** (-0.49274029).

A reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCBr** is between **-0.5 and -0.6**. Averaging similar examples:
- **CCCCCCCO**: -0.49274029
- **CCCCCCC=C**: -0.37182204
- **CI**: -1.11073232

Given that -Br is less polar than -OH but more polar than -H or -C=C, the value should be slightly more negative than **CCCCCCCO**. 

**Final predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.55** (approximate, likely between -0.5 and -0.6). 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-0.542** (close to the -0.53245302 of CCCC(=O)CCC, adjusted for -Br). 

However, looking at **CCCC(=O)CCC** (-0.53245302) and **CCCCCCCO** (-0.49274029), **CCCCCCCBr** is likely slightly more negative than **CCCCCCCO** but less than **CI**. 

**Final answer: -0.51** (a compromise between the trends). 

But to be precise, given the examples, I'd place it closer to **-0.49** (similar to **CCCCCCCO** but slightly adjusted for -Br). 

After reconsidering, the best fit is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.50**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, **CCCCCCCO** is -0.49274029, and **CCCCCCC=C** is -0.37182204. Since -Br is more polar than -C=C but less polar than -OH, the value should be between these two, closer to **CCCCCCCO**. 

Thus, the most accurate prediction is:  
**-0.48**. 

But to align with the given examples, I'll round to:  
**-0.49**. 

Final answer:  
**-0.49**. 

However, looking back at **CI** (-1.11) and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (0.121), the linear alkyl bromide should be much closer to the aliphatic examples like **CCCCCCCO** (-0.49). 

Thus, the predicted value for **CCCCCCCBr** is:  
**-0.49**. 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I'll provide:  
**-0.492**. 

After careful consideration, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.49**. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.49**.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.5693914729171572
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC, CC#C)** tend to have negative property values (around -1.2 to -1.3).  
2. **Oxygen-containing small molecules (e.g., COC=O, OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O)** have less negative values (closer to 0) due to polar functional groups.  
3. **Methanol (CH3OH)** is not explicitly listed, but **CO** (methanol without the hydrogen) is even simpler. Given that **CCC** (propane) is -1.265 and **COC=O** (methyl formate) is -0.839, **CO** (a fragment of methanol) would likely have a value between these extremes but closer to the more polar compounds.  

Given the simplicity of **CO** (a carbonyl or methanol fragment) and its polarity, I predict a property value of approximately:  

**-0.95**  

This is based on interpolation between the values of small hydrocarbons and slightly more complex oxygen-containing molecules in the dataset.  

(Note: If **CO** is interpreted as methanol (CH3OH), the value might be closer to **-0.8**, but the exact structure is ambiguous here.)
