SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 54.62600000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight Influence**: The property values generally increase with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule. For example:
   - Small molecules like **CC=C** (propene) have a low value (15.871).
   - Larger molecules like **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl) have a high value (101.978).

2. **Functional Groups and Heteroatoms**:
   - Presence of halogens (Cl, Br), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), or sulfur (S) tends to increase the property value.
   - Carbonyl groups (C=O), esters (COOR), and aromatic rings also contribute to higher values.

3. **Long Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - Pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCC**, hexane) have relatively low values (~29.816).
   - Introducing polar or functional groups (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O**, 2-octanol) increases the value (40.4398).

4. **Esters**:
   - Esters (R-COOR') tend to have moderate to high values. For example:
     - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate) is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl dodecanoate, value 63.86 in the examples). The given molecule is slightly smaller (shorter chain), so its value should be slightly lower.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**:
This is methyl decanoate (methyl ester of decanoic acid), with the structure:
- A 10-carbon chain (**CCCCCCCCCC**) with a terminal ester group (**C(=O)OC**).

Comparing to similar molecules in the examples:
- **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl dodecanoate, 12-carbon chain) has a value of 63.86.
- The given molecule has 2 fewer carbons, so its value should be slightly lower.

Given the trend, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate) is approximately **58-60**. 

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl octanoate, not explicitly listed but similar) would likely be slightly lower than methyl decanoate.
- The step from C8 to C12 esters suggests ~5-6 units per 2 carbons, so methyl decanoate (C10) would be ~60.

Given the exact example of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (63.86 for C12), we can interpolate:
- C10 ester: ~60.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is:  
**60.0** (rounded to one decimal place). 

However, since the examples show higher precision, and the trend suggests a slight decrease from C12 (63.86) to C10, a more precise estimate is **59.5**.

But reviewing the closest example:
- **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (C12 ester) = 63.86  
- **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (C8 ester, not listed) would likely be ~55-57.  
- Thus, C10 ester is likely ~59-61.

Given the lack of exact matches, the safest prediction is **60.0**.

### Final Answer:
**60.0**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 41.844699999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with an NH group). This is somewhat similar to the heterocyclic structures in the examples (e.g., c1cncnc1, C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)), which tend to have moderate property values (e.g., 22.032 and 33.1987, respectively).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine atom** is attached to the benzene ring. Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value (e.g., ClC=C has 16.05, while Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has 71.918). 
   - The **lactam-like** (oc(=O)[nH]) group is polar and may contribute similarly to other polar groups like NC(=O) or O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1 (which have values in the 20-60 range).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (71.918): This has multiple chlorines and a biphenyl structure, leading to a high value. Our molecule has only one chlorine and a smaller fused ring system, so the value should be lower.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (21.6814): This is a small polar heterocycle with no aromatic rings, so our molecule should be higher due to the aromatic system and chlorine.
- **c1cncnc1** (22.032): A simple heteroaromatic ring with no substituents. Our molecule has a chlorine and a more complex fused ring, so the value should be higher.
- **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (56.0657): This has a chlorinated heterocycle with bulky substituents. Our molecule is less bulky but has similar polar features, so the value may be slightly lower.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above comparisons, the property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is likely in the range of **40-50**. A reasonable estimate would be around **45.0**.

However, looking more closely at the examples, the presence of a chlorine on an aromatic ring combined with a polar heterocycle (like in **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**, 48.1468) suggests a value closer to **48-50**. 

Given the simpler structure (only one chlorine and no additional bulky groups), I would predict a value slightly lower than 48.1468, say **46.5**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 46.5** (rounded to one decimal place). 

This is based on the balance between the chlorine's contribution and the polar heterocyclic core.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 22.130399999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., CCCCCl, CCC(C)CC) have values in the **20-30** range.
2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** or nitrite/nitroso groups tend to increase the property value slightly compared to their non-nitrogen counterparts. For example:
   - Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a value of **40.7042** (nitro group present).
   - Simple alkanes without nitro groups (e.g., CCC(C)CC) have lower values (~29.746).
3. **Branching** (e.g., CC(C)N(=O)=O) may slightly reduce the value compared to linear nitroalkanes, but the nitro group still dominates.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CCCOCC** (ether, no nitro group): **26.784**
- **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (nitro group + heterocycle): **40.7042**
- **CCCCCl** (simple chloroalkane): **25.628**

The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is a branched nitroalkane. Given the nitro group's contribution and the branching effect, its value should be higher than simple alkanes but lower than more complex nitro-containing molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is **~35-40**. A precise prediction would be:

**36.5** (approximate, considering the nitro group's contribution and branching). 

However, looking at the closest analog (Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO with **40.7042**), and accounting for the simpler structure of CC(C)N(=O)=O, a more refined estimate is:

**38.2** (likely in the upper 30s due to the nitro group's significant contribution). 

For specificity, I predict:  
**38.5** (rounded to one decimal place). 

### Final Answer:
**38.5**

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 93.68260000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Molecular Complexity**: The molecule is a steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (tetracyclic framework), similar to the example **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**, which has a property value of **90.881**. This suggests that complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups tend to have high property values.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Present in the given molecule (similar to some examples with OH groups, but not a dominant factor).
   - **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: Two carbonyl groups (one in a ring and one as an aldehyde-like side chain). Carbonyls generally increase the property value, as seen in many examples (e.g., **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** has 30.136, but larger structures with C=O are higher).
   - **Ring strain and rigidity**: The fused ring system contributes significantly to the property value due to steric and electronic effects.

3. **Size and Branching**: The molecule is large and heavily branched, similar to **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**, which has a value of **104.1427**. However, the given molecule is slightly less complex (no aromatic rings attached), so its value should be slightly lower.

4. **Comparison to Closest Example**:
   - The closest example is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = 90.881), which is also a tetracyclic steroid-like molecule with a carbonyl group. The given molecule has an additional hydroxyl group and an aldehyde-like side chain, which may slightly increase the property value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the example with **90.881** but with slightly more functionalization (extra -OH and -CH2OH), the predicted property value for **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO** is:

**92.5** (rounded to one decimal place, consistent with the trend of increasing value with additional polar groups). 

This aligns with the observed trend that large, rigid, polycyclic structures with multiple polar groups (C=O, -OH) have high property values.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 74.29490000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). From the examples:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) tend to have property values in the range of ~30–50 (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: 36.462, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: 31.444).
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., fused rings) increase the value (e.g., C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13: 72.19).

2. **Substituents**:
   - Fluorine substituents (F): The presence of fluorine tends to lower the property value slightly (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: 31.444).
   - Chlorine substituent (Cl): Chlorine tends to increase the value modestly (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1: 48.958).
   - Amide/carbamate-like linkages (C(=O)NC(=O)N): These polar groups add to the complexity and likely increase the value. For example, NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: 46.8501, which includes a thiourea linkage.

3. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is larger than simple mono-substituted aromatics but smaller than highly fused systems. It has two aromatic rings linked by a polar group, similar to O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (52.958), but with additional polar and halogen substituents.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 52.958 (two aromatic rings linked by oxygen).
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**: 46.8501 (thiourea linked to an aromatic ring).
- **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: 48.958 (chlorinated fused rings).
- **Fc1cccc(F)c1**: Likely lower than chlorinated analogs (e.g., ~35–40).

Given the additional polar amide/carbamate linkage and the presence of both fluorine and chlorine, the value should be higher than simple halogenated aromatics but not as high as large fused systems. 

### Estimated Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is:

**Predicted Property Value: 54.2**  

This accounts for:
- The two aromatic rings (~40–50 range).
- The polar amide/carbamate linkage (~+5–10).
- The fluorine (slight reduction) and chlorine (modest increase) effects. 

The value is slightly higher than O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (52.958) due to the additional polar and halogen contributions.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 31.378999999999984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (which is **1-ethoxypropane** or ethyl isopropyl ether), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Ether functional group (R-O-R')**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate) has a property value of **26.924**.
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate) has a property value of **42.4845**.
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol) has a property value of **34.6588**.
   - **CCCO** (1-propanol) has a property value of **26.6108**.
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a property value of **31.1578**.

2. **Branching effects**:
   - Branching tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear analogs (e.g., **CC(C)CO** vs. **CCCO**).
   - **CC(C)C** (isobutane) has a higher value than linear alkanes.

3. **Molecular size and polarity**:
   - Ethers with small alkyl groups (like **CCCOC(C)C**) tend to have property values in the range of **30–40**, similar to alcohols or esters of comparable size.

### Prediction for **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a small, branched ether with 5 carbons (similar in size to **CC(C)CO** or **CCOC(=O)CC**).
- The presence of the ether oxygen adds polarity, but the branching (isopropyl group) may slightly increase the value compared to linear ethers.
- Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be between **30 and 35**.

### Final predicted property value:
**32.5** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar molecules in the dataset). 

(Note: The property appears to correlate with molecular weight, polarity, and branching, but without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, boiling point, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 58.76170000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (uracil-like) ring** with substitutions:
   - A **bromine (Br)** atom attached to the ring.
   - A **methyl (C)** group and a **propyl (CCC)** group attached to the nitrogen.
   - Two **carbonyl (C=O)** groups in the ring.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The presence of **Br** (halogen) increases the property value (e.g., compare Cl-substituted aromatics like Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 = 36.462 vs. non-halogenated analogs).
   - The **two carbonyl groups** and **nitrogen heterocycle** contribute to higher values (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC = 44.6964).
   - The **propyl group** adds some hydrophobicity but not as much as aromatic rings.

3. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (48.4457): Contains Br and an amide, but no heterocycle.
   - **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (65.8664): Polycyclic aromatic with nitrogen, but no Br or carbonyls.
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (83.6841): Complex heterocycle with Cl, NO₂, and carbonyls.

### Estimation:
Given the **bromine substitution**, **two carbonyls**, and **nitrogen heterocycle**, the property value should be **higher than simple halogenated aromatics** (e.g., 36–48) but **lower than highly conjugated systems** (e.g., 65–83). 

A reasonable estimate is **~58–65**. 

Considering the **propyl group** slightly reduces polarity compared to pure heterocycles, I predict:

**Predicted Property Value: 62.3**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 51.87800000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings and conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (especially fused or conjugated) tend to have higher property values. 
   - Example: **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **105.036**, while simpler aromatics like benzene derivatives have lower values.

2. **Biphenyl-like structures**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a dibenzofuran/heterocyclic analog) has a value of **83.3724**.
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative) has a value of **53.422**.
   - The presence of two connected phenyl rings (biphenyl) is simpler than fused polycyclics but more complex than single-ring aromatics.

3. **Substituents**:
   - Substituents like halogens, nitro groups, or alkyl chains can influence the property, but the base structure (aromaticity/conjugation) dominates.

### Prediction:
- Biphenyl (**c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**) has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, allowing conjugation but not as extensive as fused rings. 
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (83.3724) is more complex (fused rings + nitrogen), so biphenyl should be lower.
  - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (53.422) is a naphthalene derivative, which is fused and thus more conjugated than biphenyl.
  - Simpler aromatics like toluene (**Cc1ccccc1**) are not in the examples, but biphenyl is more conjugated.

Given this, the property value for biphenyl is likely **between 50 and 60**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 55.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with conjugation/aromaticity.)

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 28.76099999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCS** (butane-1-thiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight and Size**: Larger molecules (more atoms, rings, or branches) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (bicyclic, 10 carbons): 43.916
   - **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (complex with rings and heteroatoms): 60.0924
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (linear 8-carbon chain): 38.98

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of polar or heavy-atom functional groups (e.g., Cl, Br, S, N, O) increases the property value. For example:
   - **Brc1cccc2ccccc12** (bromine substituent): 51.648
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (multiple chlorines): 71.918
   - **CCCCS** (sulfur-containing): Likely higher than pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Hydrocarbons vs. Heteroatom-Containing Molecules**:
   - Pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**): ~30-40.
   - Sulfur-containing (e.g., **CCCCS**): Likely higher due to sulfur's contribution.

4. **Specific Examples Similar to CCCCS**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (5-carbon chain with double bond): 29.722
   - **CC(C)I** (5-carbon with iodine): 29.156
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (8-carbon with double bond): 43.573
   - **CCCCS** is a 4-carbon chain with a sulfur (thiol), which is less bulky than iodine but more polarizable than a double bond.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- The molecule is a 4-carbon chain with a thiol group (-SH). 
- Compared to **CCCC(=C)C** (29.722), the sulfur atom will increase the property value due to its higher polarizability and atomic weight. 
- Compared to **CC(C)I** (29.156), sulfur is less heavy than iodine, so the value will be lower than 29.156 if iodine were the dominant factor, but the examples suggest sulfur increases the value more than a double bond.
- A reasonable estimate is between **30 and 35**, leaning toward the higher end due to sulfur's influence.

### Final Prediction:
**Property value for CCCCS: ~32.5** (likely between 31 and 34 based on trends). 

Given the examples, a precise estimate is **32.8**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with molecular size and heteroatom presence.)

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 35.77479999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: Larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (simple branched alkane) has a value of **29.746**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (more branched and larger) has a value of **43.527**.
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (cyclic with hydroxyl) has a value of **47.3498**.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) tend to increase the property value compared to their non-hydroxyl counterparts. For example:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (with -OH) has a value of **35.8228**, while similar alkanes without -OH are lower.
   - The presence of **-OH** in **CCCC(C)(C)CO** suggests a moderate increase over similar non-hydroxyl structures.

3. **Branched vs. Linear**:
   - Branched alkanes with hydroxyl groups (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)O**) have values around **31.1358** to **35.8228**.
   - **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched alkane with a primary hydroxyl group, similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** but with slightly less branching.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: **35.8228**
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: **31.1358**
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O**: **47.3498** (cyclic, higher due to ring structure).

### Prediction for **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alkane with a primary hydroxyl group, similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** but with slightly less branching (one less carbon in the main chain). 
- The hydroxyl group will increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** would be ~30).
- Given the similarity to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (35.8228) but with slightly less branching, the value should be slightly lower.

### Estimated Property Value:
**34.5** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the examples).

### Final Answer:
**34.5**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 48.685000000000024
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **methylnaphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene, as the position isn't specified). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group (-CH3) attached.

### Comparison with Examples:
1. **Naphthalene Core**: 
   - The molecule **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **26.442**.
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene, similar to the given molecule) has a value of **53.422**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (dimethylnaphthalene) has a value of **53.422**, same as the monomethyl version, suggesting the methyl group's position doesn't drastically change the property.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Adding a methyl group to benzene (**c1ccccc1** → **Cc1ccccc1**) increases the value from **26.442** to **35.916** (a ~9.5 increase).
   - For naphthalene, the base value without substitution isn't provided, but the methylated version is **53.422**.

3. **Other Fused Rings**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex fused ring system) has a value of **66.191**, which is higher due to additional rings.

### Prediction:
The given molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methylnaphthalene, structurally very similar to **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (value = **53.422**). The slight difference in methyl position (position 1 vs. position 2) is unlikely to significantly alter the property, as seen in the benzene vs. toluene comparison.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is:
**53.422** (same as the provided methylnaphthalene example).

To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a cyclic imide (two amide groups on a 5-membered ring, **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1**), similar to the structure **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = 44.6024).  
   - The cyclic imide contributes significantly to the property value (likely related to molecular weight, polar surface area, or another descriptor).

2. **Substituents**:  
   - The given molecule has a **C(C)CCC** group and a **CC=C** group attached to the cyclic imide, whereas the example has a simpler **C** (methyl) and **CC=C** (allyl) group.  
   - The **C(C)CCC** substituent is bulkier (5 carbons + branching) compared to the example's **C** (methyl), which will increase the property value.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:  
   - The example **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has a property of **44.6024**.  
   - Adding a **C(C)CCC** group (more hydrophobic and larger) instead of just **C** should increase the property value.  
   - From other examples, branching and longer chains tend to increase the value (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** = 35.7528 vs. **CC(C)CO** = 21.9238).  

4. **Estimated Adjustment**:  
   - The **C(C)CCC** group adds ~4-5 carbons and branching compared to the example's **C**.  
   - Based on trends in the data, this could increase the property by ~15-20 units.  

### Predicted Property:
Given the example with **44.6024**, adding the bulkier substituent suggests a value in the range of **~60-65**.  

Looking for similar-sized molecules:  
- **c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2c(O)cccc2** (62.502) is somewhat comparable in complexity.  
- **CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C** (45.912) is smaller but has some similarity.  

Given the cyclic imide core and the larger substituents, a reasonable prediction is:  

**Predicted property value: 61.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on structural trends in the data.)  

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is approximately **61.25**.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 31.444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Not explicitly given, but substituted benzenes provide clues.
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: 44.169 (chloro-iodobenzene)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 81.938 (hexachlorobiphenyl)
   - **COc1ccccc1O**: 34.6588 (methoxyphenol)
   - **Cc1ccccc1CC**: 45.198 (ethyltoluene)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 71.918 (tetrachlorobiphenyl)

   Aromatic rings with heavier or more polar substituents (e.g., halogens, methoxy) tend to have higher property values.

2. **Fluorinated Compounds**:
   - No explicit examples of fluorinated aromatics, but fluorine is highly electronegative and small, which may affect the property differently than chlorine or bromine.

3. **Trifluoromethyl Group (-CF3)**:
   - The -CF3 group is bulky and highly electronegative but less polarizable than chlorine or bromine. It is often lipophilic but not as heavy as iodine or multiple chlorines.

### Comparison:
- **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (chloro-iodobenzene): 44.169 (iodine is heavy and polarizable)
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (tetrachlorobiphenyl): 71.918 (multiple heavy chlorines)
- **Cc1ccccc1CC** (ethyltoluene): 45.198 (alkyl groups, less polar)

The trifluoromethyl group is less polarizable than iodine or multiple chlorines but more polar than simple alkyl groups. Thus, the property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** should be higher than alkyl-substituted benzenes but lower than heavily halogenated benzenes.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is between 40 and 50. A specific prediction would be close to **44.0**, considering the balance between the electronegativity of fluorine and the lack of heavy atoms.

**Final predicted property value: 44.0**

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 35.986
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be **molar refractivity** (a measure of the polarizability of a molecule, often correlated with molecular volume and electronic structure). 

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar hexose derivative). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Oxygen-rich molecules** (e.g., polyols, sugars) tend to have moderate molar refractivity values due to their high electronegativity and compact hydrogen-bonded structures. For example:
   - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (mannitol-like) has a value of **38.1988**.
   - `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2` (cyclic amide) has **42.5824**.
   - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) has **29.7716**.

2. The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar to the above examples but has **one more oxygen** in a cyclic structure (pyranose ring). This would slightly increase its polarizability compared to linear polyols.

3. Cyclic structures (e.g., `CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`) often have higher molar refractivity due to constrained geometry and increased density of polarizable electrons.

### Prediction:
Given the cyclic oxygen-rich nature of the molecule, its molar refractivity should be **slightly higher** than the linear polyol example (38.1988) but not as high as large aromatic or polycyclic systems. 

**Predicted value: ~40.5** (likely between 39 and 42). 

A more precise estimate based on the examples would be **40.2**.

**Final answer: 40.2** (rounded to one decimal place).

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 104.59560000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, including factors like:

1. **Molecular size and branching**: Larger and more branched molecules tend to have higher values.
2. **Functional groups**: Presence of multiple functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, halogens, aromatic rings) increases the value.
3. **Heteroatoms and unsaturation**: Oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and double/triple bonds contribute to higher values.
4. **Rigidity/cyclic structures**: Polycyclic systems (e.g., steroids, fused rings) often have high values.

### Given molecule:
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Structural analysis:
1. **Core structure**: A polycyclic steroid-like framework (4 fused rings), which is highly rigid and complex.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - Two carbonyl groups (C=O): One in an ester (CC(=O)O-) and one in a ketone (C3(O)...C=O).
   - Two hydroxyl groups (-OH): One on C3 and one on the fused ring system.
   - An enone system (C=CC=O) in one of the rings.
3. **Substituents**: Methyl groups and an acetate-like side chain (CC(=O)O-).
4. **Size**: Large (20+ carbons) with significant branching and cyclic constraints.

### Comparison to examples:
- The highest values in the examples are for large, polycyclic, or highly functionalized molecules:
  - **97.546**: ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl (a highly chlorinated polycyclic).
  - **94.255**: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (large, with phosphorus and multiple functional groups).
  - **87.3338**: CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (steroid-like with carbonyl and hydroxyl).
- The given molecule is even more complex than the steroid example (87.3338) due to:
  - Additional carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.
  - An enone system and ester functionality.
  - Larger size and more fused rings.

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural complexity and comparison to similar examples, the predicted value is likely in the range of **95-105**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 98.75** (reflecting its similarity to the highest examples but accounting for additional functional groups). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 82.74080000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: The molecule is a polycyclic structure with multiple rings (steroid-like framework), including a ketone group (**C=O**) and a hydroxyl group (**OH**). This suggests significant size and polarity.
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Ketone (C=O)**: Present in examples like **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (49.3237) and **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (78.7306). The latter is structurally similar (steroid-like) and has a higher value due to size and OH groups.
   - **Hydroxyl (OH)**: Present in many examples, generally increasing the property value (e.g., **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is 33.1168, while larger molecules with OH are higher).
3. **Ring Systems**: Polycyclic systems like **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (78.7306) and **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (54.684) show higher values due to increased surface area and rigidity.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (78.7306), which shares:
  - A steroid-like polycyclic core.
  - A hydroxyl group.
  - Similar size and complexity.
- The given molecule has an additional ketone group, which may slightly increase the property value compared to the reference (78.7306).

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarity and the additional ketone functionality, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is likely slightly higher than **78.7306**. 

**Final Prediction: ~80.0** (rounded to one decimal place based on trends in the data). 

### Note:
Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted (e.g., molar refractivity, polar surface area, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on structural analogs in the provided data. If the property is known (e.g., molar refractivity), the value aligns with expectations for such a polycyclic system.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 47.40010000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with:
   - An acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**)
   - A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**)
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide (CC(=O)N-)**: This is a polar group that can contribute to higher property values (e.g., hydrogen bonding).
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing and polar group, which also tends to increase the property value.
3. **Aromatic Ring**: The benzene ring provides a rigid, planar structure, and the substitution pattern (para-disubstituted) may influence the property.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (38.3815)**: This has an aldehyde and methoxy group. The nitro group in our molecule is more polar than the methoxy, and the amide is more polar than the aldehyde, so we expect a higher value.
- **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (33.0964)**: This is nitrobenzene. Our molecule is similar but with an additional acetamido group, which should increase the property.
- **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (39.6484)**: This is similar to our molecule but with a methoxy instead of an acetamido group. The amide is more polar, so our value should be higher.
- **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2 (67.1701)**: This has a nitro group and amide-like features, but with additional complexity. Our molecule is simpler but shares key features, suggesting a value in the 50-70 range.
- **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1 (no exact example, but similar to acetamide derivatives)**: Simpler amides without nitro groups tend to be in the 40-60 range.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the presence of both a polar amide and a nitro group on the benzene ring, the property value is likely higher than nitrobenzene (33.0964) and similar to or higher than the methoxy-nitrobenzene (39.6484). The additional polarity from the amide suggests a value in the **50-60** range. 

Looking at the closest analogs, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 52.5** (approximate midpoint between 50-55, considering the combined effects of the amide and nitro groups). 

However, reviewing the examples more carefully, **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O (49.5131)** has a nitro group and a cyclic amide, and our molecule is somewhat simpler but with similar polarity. Thus, a more precise estimate might be slightly higher, around **51-53**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted Property Value: 52.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the given examples). 

This balances the contributions of the amide and nitro groups while aligning with structurally similar molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 90.61200000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to correlate with molecular weight, complexity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Weight**: The molecule is large, with multiple heavy atoms (P, S, Cl, O, N, C). 
   - Contains a **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)S)**, which is bulky.
   - Includes a **chlorinated benzoxazole-like ring (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**, adding complexity.
   - Two ethoxy groups (**OCC**) further increase the size.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **P=S** (thiophosphate) and **P-O-C** (phosphate ester) are present, similar to some of the larger examples (e.g., 84.967 for **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3**).
   - The **chlorinated aromatic ring** is analogous to **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (48.958) but with additional complexity.
   - The **benzoxazole-like moiety** resembles fused heterocycles in the examples (e.g., 76.814 for **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule is larger than **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (84.967) but has fewer aromatic rings.
   - It is smaller than **CC(=O)OC3(CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C)C(C)=O** (106.411), which is a steroid-like structure.
   - The presence of **P=S** and **Cl** suggests a value higher than simpler chlorinated aromatics (e.g., 48.958) but lower than very large fused systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the size and functional groups, the property likely falls between **80 and 90**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 86.5**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Large, heteroatom-rich molecules (e.g., 84.967, 81.9959) fall in this range.
- The phosphorothioate and chlorinated benzoxazole contribute significantly to the value.

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 26.54079999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a property value of **21.9238**.
   - **CCCC(C)O** (pentanol-like) has a property value of **40.4398**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (octanol-like) has a property value of **45.0568**.
   - **CCCCC(CC)CO** (branched alcohol) has a property value of **40.3918**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sugar alcohol) has a property value of **38.1988**.

   The property values for alcohols seem to increase with molecular weight and branching, but branching may slightly reduce the value compared to linear analogs.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Structures**:
   - **CCC** (propane) has a value of **15.965**, while **CC(C)CO** (branched) has **21.9238**.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol-like) is more branched than **CC(C)CO**, so we might expect a slightly lower value than **21.9238** due to increased branching.

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of **-OH** tends to give values in the **20-50** range, depending on size and branching.
   - Tertiary alcohols (like **CC(C)(C)CO**) are more sterically hindered, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to primary or secondary alcohols.

### Prediction for **CC(C)(C)CO**:
This is a tertiary alcohol (tert-butanol with an extra methylene group). Comparing it to similar structures:
- **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **21.9238**.
- **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched, so the value should be slightly lower. 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly less than **21.9238**, likely in the range of **18-21**. Given the examples, a precise prediction is **20.5**.

However, looking at the trend more carefully:
- **CCC** (propane): **15.965**.
- **CC(C)CO**: **21.9238** (increase due to -OH and branching).
- **CC(C)(C)CO** would likely be slightly higher than **CCC** but less than **CC(C)CO** due to steric hindrance.

A refined estimate is **19.5**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**19.5** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the given examples). 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest analog is **CC(C)CO** at **21.9238**, and **CC(C)(C)CO** is expected to be slightly lower. Thus, a more precise prediction is **20.0**.

### Adjusted Prediction:
After reconsidering the branching effect, the predicted value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is **20.0**. 

But to match the precision of the given examples (typically 4 decimal places), we'll provide **20.0000**.

### Final Answer:
**20.0000**

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 34.5094
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a purine-like heterocycle with two fused rings (imidazole and pyrimidine). It has multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Carbonyl (C=O)
   - Multiple NH groups (hydrogen bond donors/acceptors)
   - Aromatic nitrogens (hydrogen bond acceptors)
3. **Polarity**: Highly polar due to the presence of multiple heteroatoms and hydrogen-bonding groups.
4. **Size**: Small to medium-sized (similar to some of the smaller molecules in the examples).

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = 29.2281): This is a similar small heterocycle with a carbonyl, NH, and fluorine. The given molecule is slightly larger and has more hydrogen-bonding groups, which may increase the property value.
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 29.2701): Another small heterocycle with similar features. Again, the given molecule is more complex.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = 41.68): A fused heterocycle with less polarity than the given molecule.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (property = 53.7424): This has multiple carbonyls and NH groups but is larger and less aromatic.

### Estimated Property:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity of **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, but its relatively small size, the property value is likely higher than the small heterocycles (~29) but lower than the larger polar molecules (~50-60). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **~35-40**. Considering the examples, a precise prediction is **~37.5**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 37.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, molecular weight, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the correlation between structure and the given values.) 

If more context were provided (e.g., the property is logP), the estimate could be refined further. For now, **37.5** is a plausible value.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 22.284999999999993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Esters and Ethers**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (diethyl phosphate): 42.4845  
   - **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O** (complex ester/ether): 60.0312  
   - **CCCOC(C)C** (simple ether): 31.379  
   - **CCOC=C** (vinyl ether): 21.823  

   These suggest that simple esters/ethers typically fall in the range of **30–45**, with more complex or polar ones reaching higher values.

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like ketone/ester): 96.881  
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate-like): Not directly given, but similar to **CCOC=C** (21.823) but with a carbonyl, likely higher.  
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (aldehyde with ether): 38.3815  

   Carbonyl groups (esters, aldehydes, ketones) tend to increase the property value compared to purely aliphatic chains.

3. **Small Esters**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 17.3548  
   - **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate) is structurally similar but with an ester group instead of alcohol. Esters typically have higher values than alcohols (e.g., **CCOC=C** is 21.823, while **CCCOC(C)C** is 31.379).  

### Prediction for **CC(C)OC=O**:
- Methyl acetate is a small ester with a simple structure. Comparing it to similar molecules:
  - **CCOC=C** (21.823) is an ether, while **CC(C)OC=O** has an additional carbonyl, likely increasing the value.
  - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (38.3815) is an aromatic aldehyde with an ether, which is more complex but suggests carbonyls increase the value.
  - **CCCOC(C)C** (31.379) is a simple ether, so the ester **CC(C)OC=O** should be higher.

Given these comparisons, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is **~32–38**. A precise prediction would be **34.5**, interpolating between simple ethers and carbonyl-containing compounds.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**34.5** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples).

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 65.52540000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl (benzene) rings attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea functional group (**-N-C(=O)-N-**). 

Key features:
1. **Urea core**: This is a polar and hydrogen-bonding functional group, which typically increases the property value compared to simple hydrocarbons.
2. **Two phenyl rings**: These are large, aromatic, and moderately hydrophobic groups. They contribute significantly to the property value due to their size and potential for π-stacking interactions.
3. **No halogens or other substituents**: The absence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) or other electronegative groups means the property value won't be as high as some of the heavily halogenated examples (e.g., Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl with 51.492).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (50.9997): This is a carbamate with a phenyl ring and methyl substituents. The urea derivative here is somewhat similar but has two phenyl rings instead of one, which would likely increase the property value.
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (48.3414): This is a cyclic urea with alkyl substituents. The aromatic rings in the target molecule should increase the property value compared to this.
- **c1ccncc1** (24.237): A simple pyridine ring, much smaller and less polar than the target.
- **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** (59.249): A polycyclic aromatic system (carbazole-like), which is larger but somewhat comparable due to the aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
Given the two phenyl rings and the urea core, the property value should be **higher than 50.9997** (from the carbamate example) but **lower than 59.249** (from the polycyclic aromatic example). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **55-57**. Splitting the difference, I'll predict:

**Predicted property value: 56.2** (This is an educated guess based on the examples and structural trends.) 

(Note: If this property is logP or a similar descriptor, the value aligns with the increased hydrophobicity from the two phenyl rings and the polarity of the urea group.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 54.684000000000026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to molecular size, aromaticity, and functional groups.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of **78.96**.
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly listed, but simpler aromatic systems with small substituents (e.g., **Sc1ccccc1**) have values around **33.694**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound with two phenyl rings) has a value of **57.06**.

2. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)**:
   - Fluorene has three fused rings (two benzene rings fused to a cyclopentadiene ring), making it larger than biphenyl or naphthalene but smaller than the large polycyclic example (78.96).
   - It lacks heteroatoms or polar functional groups, so the value will be influenced primarily by its aromaticity and size.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (78.96) is much larger (more rings), so fluorene should have a lower value.
   - The molecule **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (57.06) has two phenyl rings linked by a diazo group, which is somewhat analogous in size but with different electronic effects.

### Prediction:
Given that fluorene is smaller than the large polycyclic example (78.96) but larger than simpler biphenyl-like structures (~57.06), and considering its fully conjugated aromatic system, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the diazo-biphenyl example but not as high as the much larger polycyclic systems. 

**Predicted property value for fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13): ~65.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 53.09
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, hydrogen-bond donor/accepting).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: Sulfonyl group (polar, contributes to higher property values in the examples).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like substitution (moderate polarity, seen in examples with values ~30-50).

2. **Molecular Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is medium-sized with an aromatic ring and polar substituents.
   - Similar molecules in the examples with sulfonyl groups (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**, 62.162) or polar aromatic systems (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**, 38.2387) suggest values in the range of **40-70**.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (66.908): Similar aromaticity and halogen substitution, but our molecule has more polar groups (sulfonyl and guanidine).
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (49.5131): Polar heterocycles and nitro group, somewhat similar in polarity.
   - **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O** (62.1622): Sulfonyl group and aromatic system, very close in structure.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The sulfonyl group tends to increase the property value (e.g., **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, 47.9213).
   - The guanidine-like group (**NC(=N)N**) is highly polar and likely pushes the value higher than simpler aromatic sulfonamides.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above analysis, the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is expected to have a property value in the range of **60-70**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 64.5**  

This balances the contributions of the sulfonyl group, aromatic system, and highly polar guanidine-like moiety.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 77.4538
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Given Molecule:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring (like many examples), which is substituted with multiple functional groups.
2. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**: There are two nitro groups attached to the benzene ring. From the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 34.7612, higher than phenol `c1ccccc1O` at 28.1068).
3. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a highly electronegative and bulky group, which likely increases the property value further (similar to how halogens like Cl or Br increase the value in other examples).
4. **Tertiary Amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: The nitrogen is part of a tertiary amine with an aliphatic chain. Amines can contribute to higher values, especially when part of complex structures.
5. **Alkene (CC(C)=C)**: The presence of a double bond in the side chain may slightly influence the property.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`) have values around **83.6841**.
- The trifluoromethyl group is even more electronegative than chlorine, which could push the value higher.
- The tertiary amine and additional nitro group suggest a higher value than simpler nitroaromatics (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` at 34.7612).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the complexity and multiple functional groups, the property value is likely in the **high 80s to low 90s**. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 89.5**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 22.284999999999993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols/Ethers**:
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (hexan-2-ol): 35.8228  
   - **CCCCCCCCO** (octan-1-ol): 40.4618  
   - **CCC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol): 26.5888  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (pentan-3-ol): 26.5888  
   These suggest that branching reduces the property value compared to linear chains.

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (methyl nicotinate): 35.5765  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): 46.8109  
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (hexyl acetate): 36.158  
   Esters tend to have values in the 30s to 40s, with substitutions (e.g., aromatic rings or polar groups) increasing the value.

3. **Formates (HCOOR)**:
   - **CC(C)OC=O** is an isopropyl formate (HCOOCH(CH3)2).  
   No exact formates are in the examples, but similar esters (like methyl formate or ethyl formate) would likely have values in the 30s.  
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide): 14.8684 (not an ester, but shows that simple polar groups can have lower values).  
   - **CC(C)SC(C)C** (a thioether): 37.863 (similar size/branching to isopropyl formate).

4. **Branching Effect**:
   - Branching (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)O** vs. **CCCCCC(C)O**) reduces the property value by ~10 units.  
   Isopropyl formate is branched, so its value should be lower than linear esters (e.g., ethyl formate would likely be ~35, so isopropyl formate might be ~5 units lower).

5. **Polarity/Functional Groups**:
   - The carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) groups add polarity, but the branching (isopropyl) reduces the value compared to linear analogs.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Linear esters: ~35-40  
- Branched analogs: ~5-10 units lower  
- Isopropyl formate is a small, branched ester, likely in the **low 30s**.  

Comparing to similar-sized branched molecules:
- **CCC(C)(C)O**: 26.5888 (tert-butanol, highly branched)  
- **CC(C)SC(C)C**: 37.863 (branched thioether, slightly larger)  

Isopropyl formate is smaller than **CC(C)SC(C)C** but more polar, so a value around **30-35** is reasonable.  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O: 31.5**  
(Approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures.)

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 37.5808
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: Larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (42.7759) has multiple functional groups and aromatic rings.
   - **CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC** (113.759) is very large and has multiple ester groups.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: Presence of -OH groups tends to increase the property value moderately (e.g., **Oc1cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC**, 57.6176).
   - **Methyl (-CH3)**: Alkyl groups like -CH3 contribute but not as significantly as polar groups (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1C**, 40.557).
   - **Aromatic Rings**: Aromaticity contributes significantly, especially with substitutions (e.g., **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3**, 77.314).

3. **Substitution Patterns**:
   - Multiple substitutions (e.g., halogens like Cl or Br) increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, 86.948).
   - Symmetry or conjugation can also play a role (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1**, 43.948).

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The molecule is a substituted phenol with:
  - A methyl group (-CH3) at position 1.
  - Another methyl group (-CH3) at position 3.
  - A hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 4.
- It is relatively small (similar to **c1ccccc1O**, 28.1068) but has additional methyl substitutions and a hydroxyl group.
- Compared to **CCc1ccccc1C** (40.557), which has two methyl groups on an aromatic ring, this molecule has an additional -OH group, which should increase the property value.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the presence of two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, the property value is likely in the range of **40-50**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 42.5** (rounded to one decimal place for precision). 

This is based on interpolation between similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1C** at 40.557 and **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** at 42.7759). The hydroxyl group adds some polarity, but the molecule is not as large or complex as others with higher values. 

### Final Answer:
**42.5**

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 71.89100000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight Contribution**: The property values often correlate with molecular weight, but not strictly linearly. Functional groups and heteroatoms (e.g., S, P, Cl, Br) seem to contribute disproportionately.
2. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: Molecules with the **P(=S)(OR)3** group (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**) have high property values (~73-94). The presence of **P=S** significantly increases the value.
3. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**: Aromatic rings with heavy atoms (Cl, Br, S) or polar groups (O, N) increase the property value. For example:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (71.918) has multiple Cl atoms.
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (70.403) has P=S and Cl.
4. **Sulfur (S) Contribution**: Sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., **SC** or **S(=O)**) tend to have higher values. For example:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (42.2276) has a sulfonamide group.
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** (73.093) has P=S and S.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**  
- Contains the **P(=S)(OC)2** group (similar to examples with high values ~70-94).
- Has an aromatic ring with **SC** (thioether) and **C** (methyl) substituents.
- The **SC** group is less polar than Cl/Br but still contributes significantly due to sulfur.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (70.403):  
   - P=S, 3 Cl atoms on the ring.  
   - Our molecule replaces 3 Cl with **SC** and **C**, which are less electronegative but still heavy.  
   - Expect a slightly lower value than 70.403 due to fewer halogens.

2. **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** (73.093):  
   - P=S, Cl, Br (heavier than S).  
   - Our molecule has S instead of Br/Cl, so likely lower than 73.093.

3. **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl** (78.11):  
   - Iodine is very heavy, so our molecule should be much lower.

### Predicted Value:
Given the **P=S** group and the **SC** substituent, the property value should be slightly lower than **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (70.403) but higher than simpler aromatic molecules without P=S.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**~68.5** (considering the sulfur contribution but lack of halogens).

### Final Answer:
**68.5** (approximate predicted property value).

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 76.92800000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have higher property values:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **81.938**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **86.948**
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** → **48.1468**

2. The molecule in question is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with **6 chlorine atoms** (similar to the examples above but slightly less chlorinated than the highest examples).

3. Comparing to the most similar examples:
   - **81.938** (8 Cl atoms)
   - **86.948** (10 Cl atoms)
   - **48.1468** (4 Cl atoms)

   The given molecule has **6 Cl atoms**, so we expect its value to be **between 81.938 and 86.948**, but slightly lower due to fewer chlorines.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, a reasonable estimate for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** would be:

**Predicted property value: ~84.5**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the number of chlorines and the values of similar structures.)*

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 22.152399999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes**: 
   - **CCC** (propane) has a property value of **15.965**.
   - **CC** (ethane) has a value of **11.348**.
   - This suggests that adding a **CH2** group increases the property by ~4.6 units.

2. **Functional Group Effects**:
   - **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene) has a value of **46.4052**.
     - The presence of multiple nitro groups increases the property significantly.
   - **Nitroalkanes**:
     - The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** is a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), which is analogous to propane (**CCC**) with a nitro group replacing one hydrogen.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (a complex nitroaromatic) has a value of **77.5478**, but this is heavily influenced by the aromatic ring and multiple substituents.
   - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene) has a value of **46.4052**, which is higher due to three nitro groups.
   - **CCCN(=O)=O** has only one nitro group and is a simple aliphatic nitro compound.

4. **Effect of Nitro Group on Alkanes**:
   - Adding a nitro group to propane (**CCC** → **CCCN(=O)=O**) would likely increase the property value significantly, but not as much as in aromatic systems.
   - For example, **CCC** is **15.965**, and adding a polar nitro group would likely increase this by ~20-30 units (based on the difference between propane and nitroaromatics).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Propane (**CCC**) has a value of **15.965**.
- The nitro group is highly polar and likely adds ~20-25 units to the property (similar to how **O=N(=O)** contributes in other molecules).
- The value for **CCCN(=O)=O** should be between **35 and 40**, based on the examples.

Looking at similar-sized molecules with polar groups:
- **CC(=O)C** (acetone) has a value of **25.011**.
- **CCCN(=O)=O** is larger and has a nitro group, so it should be higher than acetone but lower than highly conjugated or polyfunctionalized molecules.

### Final Estimate:
The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **35.5**.

However, considering the examples more closely:
- **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene) has a value of **35.872**, which is a similarly polar but aromatic molecule.
- **CCCN(=O)=O** is aliphatic and less conjugated, so its value might be slightly lower.

Thus, a refined prediction is **~34.0**.

But given the trend, a reasonable estimate is **34.5**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is **34.5**.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 34.1
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher property values compared to purely hydrocarbon structures. The presence of multiple halogens or heavier halogens (Br > Cl > F) increases the value.
   - Example: 
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 39.152 (Cl and Br substitution)
     - BrC(Br)Br → 30.569 (3 Br atoms)
     - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl → 71.918 (multiple Cl substitutions)

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) with halogen substitutions have property values in the range of ~35-40 for single substitutions, higher for multiple substitutions.
   - Example:
     - Cc1ccccc1C → 35.916 (no halogens, just methyl groups)
     - Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O → 37.8334 (NO2 group, similar to halogen in effect)
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 39.152 (Cl and Br on benzene)

3. **Fluorine vs. Bromine**: 
   - Fluorine is less heavy than bromine, so its contribution to the property value is smaller. 
   - Example: 
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 → 40.7037 (F substitution)
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 39.152 (Br and Cl, slightly lower than F in this case, but Br is heavier than Cl).

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 39.152 (Cl and Br on benzene)
   - COc1cccc(Cl)c1 → 38.004 (Cl and OCH3 on benzene)
   - Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is analogous to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 but with F instead of Cl.

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- The molecule is a benzene ring with F and Br substitutions (para to each other). 
- Compared to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (39.152), fluorine is lighter than chlorine, so the property value might be slightly lower. 
- However, bromine is heavier than chlorine, which could offset the decrease from fluorine. 
- The net effect is likely similar or slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 38.5** (slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to F being lighter than Cl, but Br still contributes significantly). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 45.23580000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Framework**: The molecule is a bicyclic structure with two fused rings (a cyclohexane and a cyclopentane). It has two tertiary carbons (C1 and C1 with methyl groups) and one hydroxyl group (C(O)).
2. **Size and Complexity**: It is a mid-sized molecule (similar to steroids or terpenes in the examples) but less complex than the large polycyclic examples (e.g., the steroid-like structures with property values >90).
3. **Functional Groups**: It has an alcohol (-OH) group, which is polar but not as polar as multiple halogens or other highly polar groups in the examples.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: This steroid-like molecule has a property value of **108.5986**, but it is much larger and has more polar groups (carbonyl, fluorine, multiple oxygens).
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: This molecule has a property value of **103.304**, but it is more complex with aromatic rings, halogens, and ester groups.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: This has a value of **99.9444**, again a large steroid-like structure with multiple polar groups.
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: This has a value of **91.8808**, still larger and more polar than our target molecule.
- **CCCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O**: This has a value of **70.2024**, with carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups adding polarity.

Our molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(OH)C2** is smaller and less polar than these examples. It is most similar to simpler bicyclic or monocyclic alcohols in the dataset, such as:
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (tertiary alcohol): **26.5408**
- **CC(C)O** (secondary alcohol): Not in the dataset, but likely lower.
- **CC1CCCO1** (tetrahydrofuran with alkyl groups): **24.648**

However, our molecule is larger than these and has a bicyclic structure, which would increase the property value. 

### Estimated Property Value:
Given its size (bicyclic, 10 carbons) and one hydroxyl group, the property value is likely in the range of **40-60**. Comparing to:
- **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (alkylbenzene): **45.198**
- **CC(C)SC(C)C** (thioether): **37.863**
- **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O** (lactam with aromatic): **61.735**

A reasonable estimate for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is **~48.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 48.0** (rounded to one decimal place). 

This is based on its intermediate size, bicyclic nature, and single polar hydroxyl group, placing it between simpler alcohols (~25-35) and more complex/polar structures (>60).

True Property: 74.47900000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples, particularly focusing on similar functional groups and molecular complexity.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule resembles **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 96.578) from the examples. The main difference is the replacement of the **SC(CCl)** group with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a succinimide-like fragment).
   - The **P(=S)(OCC)OCC** (thiophosphate) group is retained.
   - The **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** fragment introduces a cyclic imide with an aromatic ring, similar to phthalimide.

2. **Property Trends**:
   - The thiophosphate group with **SC(CCl)** contributes significantly to the property value (~96.578).
   - Replacing **SC(CCl)** with a **phthalimide-like** group (which is less bulky and has fewer heavy atoms) would likely **reduce** the property value slightly, but not drastically, as the cyclic imide still adds substantial molecular weight and complexity.

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** and aromatic/cyclic groups tend to have high property values (e.g., 96.578, 88.5157).
   - The phthalimide fragment is present in other examples (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has 32.7549, but this is simpler), but combined with the thiophosphate, the value should remain high.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (96.578)** and the slightly less bulky but still complex **phthalimide** replacement, the property value should be **slightly lower** than 96.578 but still in the high 80s or low 90s. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = 92.5**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples and molecular features. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 55.74700000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine, fused rings) tend to have higher property values, especially when substituted with polar or bulky groups.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (76.814) has two aromatic rings and a carbonyl group.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - The presence of carbonyl groups (e.g., amides, ketones) increases the property value.
   - Example: `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` (60.0924) has multiple carbonyls.

3. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) contribute to higher values, especially when fused or substituted.
   - Example: `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (39.865) is a nitrogen-rich heterocycle.

4. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCOC`) tend to have lower values (~20-40).

5. **Chlorine/Bulky Halogens**:
   - Halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have very high values (~76-88).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**  
- Structure: This is a **diketone-substituted imidazole** fused with a benzene ring.  
  - Contains two aromatic rings (one benzene, one imidazole with a carbonyl).  
  - Has a **carbonyl group (C=O)** directly attached to the heterocycle.  
  - Two methyl groups (`C`) are present as substituents.  

### Similar Examples:
1. `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (76.814):  
   - Similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and methyl groups.  
   - The target molecule is slightly less bulky (one less aromatic ring) but has a similar imidazole-carbonyl motif.  

2. `CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3` (83.8063):  
   - Another nitrogen-heterocycle with carbonyl and aromatic rings.  

3. `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (58.4774):  
   - Less aromatic but has multiple carbonyls, yielding a moderate value.  

### Prediction:
The target molecule has:
- A fused aromatic system (benzene + imidazole).  
- A carbonyl group directly on the heterocycle.  
- Methyl substituents (less polar than halogens but still bulky).  

Given the similarity to the first example (76.814) but with slightly less bulk, the property value should be **slightly lower**.  

### Final Prediction:
**~70.5** (likely between 68-72 based on the examples).  

For specificity, I predict:  
**70.521** (a reasonable estimate given the structural trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that it scales with molecular complexity, polarity, and aromaticity.)

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 40.775000000000006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chain Length and Functional Groups**: 
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have higher property values (e.g., **CCCCC** = 25.199, **CCCCCCCI** = 47.646).
   - The presence of polar or bulky functional groups (e.g., esters, halogens, multiple rings) increases the property value significantly (e.g., **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** = 42.4845, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** = 81.938).

2. **Esters (R-COO-R)**:
   - Esters generally have moderate property values. For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)N** = 21.2094 (small ester with an amide).
     - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** = 50.009 (longer chain ester).
   - The property value increases with the size of the alkyl groups attached to the ester.

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - The molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a hexanoic acid ethyl ester (ethyl hexanoate). It has a 6-carbon chain with an ester group (COO) attached to an ethyl group (OCC).
   - Compare this to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoic acid methyl ester), which has a 9-carbon chain and a property value of 50.009. The shorter chain in **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** would likely have a lower value.
   - Another comparable molecule is **CCC(=O)OC** (methyl butanoate), which is not in the list, but smaller esters like **CCOC(=O)N** (21.2094) suggest that longer chains increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCCCC** (pentane) = 25.199,
- **CCCCCCCI** (heptyl iodide) = 47.646,
- **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoic acid methyl ester) = 50.009,

The molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate) has a shorter chain than nonanoate but longer than pentane. Esters add moderate increments to the property. 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (50.009) but higher than simpler esters like **CCOC(=O)N** (21.2094). 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC: ~45.5** (likely between 40 and 50, leaning toward the middle due to the 6-carbon chain and ester group). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is similar in size to **CCCCCCCI** (47.646) but with an ester instead of an iodide. Since halogens often increase the value more than esters, the value might be slightly lower. 

A refined estimate: **~42-44**. 

Given the examples, I'd predict:  
**43.5** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, let's round to:  
**43.2**. 

However, reviewing again, **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (50.009) but with 3 fewer carbons. Assuming a linear reduction, ~10 units less would give ~40. 

Given the variability, a safe prediction is:  
**42.5**. 

But to align with the precision of the examples, I'll finalize:  
**42.3**. 

After reconsidering, the closest comparable ester is **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (50.009), and **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is smaller, so likely ~10% less:  
**45.0**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable answer is:  
**44.5**. 

But to match the format of the examples (4 decimal places), I'll predict:  
**44.5000**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the value likely falls between **CCC(O)C(C)C** (31.1358) and **CCCCCCCI** (47.646), so:  
**44.236** (same as **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2**). 

Given the ambiguity, the final prediction is:  
**44.236**. 

But this seems arbitrary. A better approach is to average similar structures:  
- **CCCCCCCI** (47.646) and **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (50.009) average ~48.8, but **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is smaller, so subtract ~5: **43.8**. 

Final answer:  
**43.8000**. 

After careful consideration, the most plausible prediction is:  
**44.0000**. 

But to be precise, given the examples, the value is likely close to **44.236** (as seen for a similarly complex but non-ester molecule). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is:  
**44.236**. 

However, this is likely overfitting. A more conservative estimate is:  
**42.4845** (same as **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**, another ester). 

Given the variability, the final prediction is:  
**42.4845**. 

But this seems low. The true value is likely higher, around **44-45**. 

Final answer:  
**44.5000**. 

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the examples, the predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is approximately:  
**44.500**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on molecular size and functional groups. The true value could vary slightly.) 

**Final Prediction: 44.5000**
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 37.781500000000015
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **42.3985**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, differing only by one fewer methylene group (–CH2–) in the ester side chain.

2. **Effect of Chain Length**:
   - Comparing **CCC(=O)CC** (25.589) and **CC(=O)CC** (not explicitly given, but shorter chains generally have lower values), we see that longer aliphatic chains increase the property value slightly.
   - However, in esters, the difference between methyl (—OCH3) and ethyl (—OCH2CH3) is smaller, as seen in:
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (44.0633) vs. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (42.3985). The presence of an additional hydroxyl group increases the value slightly.

3. **Methyl Benzoate vs. Ethyl Benzoate**:
   - The difference between methyl and ethyl benzoate is likely small, with methyl being slightly lower due to the shorter chain.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyl benzoate (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) has a value of **42.3985**,
- Methyl benzoate (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is almost identical but with a shorter chain (methyl instead of ethyl),

we can estimate that the property value for methyl benzoate will be **slightly lower** than ethyl benzoate. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1: ~40.0**

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is 42.3985,
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (with an additional hydroxyl) is 44.0633,
- **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (no hydroxyl, methyl ester) should be slightly less than 42.3985.

A more precise estimate would be **~40.0 - 41.0**. Given the trend, I predict:

**Predicted value: 40.5**

But to match the precision of the given examples, I'll round to **40.5** or **40.6**. 

However, looking back at **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (42.3985) and considering that methyl is smaller than ethyl, the difference is likely ~1.5-2 units lower. Thus:

**Final predicted value: 40.6** (rounded from 42.4 - 1.8). 

But to be more consistent with the examples, let's say **40.6**. 

However, another similar molecule is **CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2** (68.4385), which is more complex, so this isn't directly comparable. 

Given the lack of a direct methyl vs. ethyl comparison in the examples, the safest estimate is slightly less than 42.3985, so:

**Predicted value: 40.6** (approximate). 

But looking at **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (44.0633) vs. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (42.3985), the difference is ~1.7 for the hydroxyl. The methyl vs. ethyl difference is likely smaller, so perhaps **41.0** is more accurate. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll settle on:

**Predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1: 41.0** (conservative estimate). 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll go with **40.6**. 

However, reviewing again, the closest analog is **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (42.3985), and methyl should be ~1-2 units lower, so:

**Final answer: 40.6** (approximate). 

Given the examples, the most precise estimate is **40.6**. 

Thus:

**Predicted value: 40.6**
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 25.01099999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics):**
   - **CC/C=C/C** (pent-2-ene): 25.105  
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): 36.533  
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): 40.437  
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): 23.085  
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (butan-2-one): 20.972  

   Alkanes and simple alkenes tend to have values in the 20-40 range, with unsaturation (double/triple bonds) slightly increasing the value compared to saturated analogs.

2. **Conjugated Systems:**
   - **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene), which may have a slightly higher value than non-conjugated alkenes due to extended π-electron delocalization.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules:**
   - **CC/C=C/C** (pent-2-ene, non-conjugated): 25.105  
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, conjugated with aromatic ring): 36.533  
   - **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene) is expected to be between these, likely closer to the lower end since it lacks an aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Non-conjugated alkenes: ~25 (e.g., pent-2-ene: 25.105).  
- Conjugated dienes: Likely slightly higher due to conjugation effects (but less than aromatic systems).  

A reasonable estimate for **C=CCC=C** is **~28-30**.  

Looking at the examples, the closest analog is **CC/C=C/C** (25.105), and conjugation would modestly increase this.  

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: 27.5**  

*(This is an educated estimate based on the given data. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being predicted, which appears to correlate with molecular size, unsaturation, and conjugation.)*

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 30.569
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to halogenated compounds, particularly those with multiple heavy halogens (Br, Cl).

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): 51.648
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 86.948
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a bromo-chloro-fluoro compound): 24.623
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene): 48.958
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (octachlorobiphenyl-like): 76.928

   These show that heavy halogens (Br, Cl) increase the property value, with more halogens leading to higher values.

2. **Small Halogenated Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (small, mixed halogens): 24.623
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is even simpler but has three heavy bromines, which should significantly increase the value compared to lighter halogens or fewer substitutions.

3. **Comparison to Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CCC=O** (small, no halogens): 16.355
   - **CC(C)CO** (small, no halogens): 21.9238
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (small, mixed halogens): 24.623

   **BrC(Br)Br** is smaller than most examples but has three bromines, which are heavier and more polarizable than Cl or F, suggesting a higher value than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (24.623) but lower than larger polyhalogenated compounds like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (86.948).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The property value increases with the number and size of halogens.
- **BrC(Br)Br** is small but has three bromines, which are heavier than chlorines or fluorines.
- It should be higher than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (24.623) but lower than larger polyhalogenated aromatics.

A reasonable estimate is **~30-35**. Given the examples, a precise prediction is **32.456**.

However, looking more closely at the small halogenated molecules:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**: 24.623 (mixed F, Cl, Br)
- **BrC(Br)Br** has three Br atoms, which are more polarizable and heavier than the single Br in the above example. 

A more accurate estimate would be **~28-32**. Splitting the difference, I predict: **30.542**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is **30.542**.

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 96.57800000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and the presence of certain functional groups or heteroatoms (e.g., Cl, S, P, N, O, aromatic rings).

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 94.835). This group significantly increases the property value due to its size and heteroatoms.
2. **Aromatic rings**: Two aromatic rings (one benzene and one lactam-fused ring), contributing to the property similarly to other aromatic systems in the examples.
3. **Chlorine atom (Cl)**: Present in the side chain, which adds to the property (e.g., Cl-containing molecules like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** have higher values).
4. **Lactam group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: A fused bicyclic system with a carbonyl, similar to some of the larger examples.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Two ethoxy groups attached to phosphorus, adding to the molecular weight and complexity.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 94.835) is structurally similar, with a phosphorothioate group, aromatic ring, and Cl substituent. Our molecule has an additional fused lactam ring and ethoxy groups instead of methoxy, which may increase the property slightly.
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 86.1928) has multiple Cl and aromatic rings but lacks the phosphorothioate group, so our molecule should be higher.
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)C(F)(F)F)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property = 108.156) is larger but shares some features (Cl, aromatic, carbonyl). Our molecule is smaller but has the P(=S) group.

### Prediction:
Given the phosphorothioate group, aromatic systems, Cl substituent, and lactam, the property value should be **close to or slightly higher than 94.835** (the phosphorothioate example). The additional fused ring and ethoxy groups may push it slightly higher.

**Predicted property value: ~96.5** (reasonable range: 95-98). 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**96.742** (based on interpolation of similar examples). 

This is an educated estimate given the structural similarity to the provided examples.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 88.51570000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to correlate with molecular weight, complexity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains:
   - A **dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O))**, similar to "CN(C)C(=O)C" (property = 24.368) and "CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C" (property = 32.77).
   - A **chlorinated phenyl ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1))**, similar to "Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" (property = 38.1064) or "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl" (property = 46.482).
   - A **fused heterocyclic system (n2nc(oc2=O))**, somewhat resembling "Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23" (property = 53.107).
   - A bulky **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which adds significant mass (similar to "C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3" with property = 113.251).

2. **Functional Group Contributions**:
   - The dimethylamide and chlorophenyl together suggest a baseline of ~30–40.
   - The fused heterocycle (with an oxo group) adds ~10–15.
   - The tert-butyl group adds ~15–20.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - "CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C" (simpler, no aromatic/heterocycle) = 32.77.
   - "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl" (chlorinated phenyl) = 46.482.
   - "Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23" (fused heterocycle) = 53.107.
   - "CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3" (bulky tert-butyl + aromatic) = 113.251.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of a dimethylamide, chlorophenyl, fused heterocycle, and tert-butyl group, the property value is likely in the range of **65–75**. A reasonable estimate is **~68.5**, considering the contributions from each moiety.

### Final Answer:
**68.5** (predicted property value).
==================================================
Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 69.65280000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine (Cl) Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple Cl substituents tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (4 Cl atoms) has a value of **48.1468**.
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (2 Cl atoms) has a value of **61.898**.
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2 Cl atoms) has a value of **38.1268**.

2. **Oxygen (O) Substitution**:
   - Hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (-O-) contribute moderately to the property value. For example:
     - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (1 OH, 1 CHO) has a value of **33.4943**.
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (1 OH, 2 Cl) has a value of **38.1268**.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Each aromatic ring adds to the property value, especially when substituted with halogens or polar groups.

4. **Molecular Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger molecules with multiple rings or functional groups tend to have higher values. For example:
     - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (small, polar) has a value of **26.1852**.
     - **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O** (large, complex) has a value of **81.717**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
- Two aromatic rings linked by an ether (-O-) bridge.
- Three chlorine (Cl) substituents (one on the first ring, two on the second ring).
- Two hydroxyl (-OH) groups (one on each ring).

Comparable examples:
- **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (4 Cl, 1 OH): **48.1468**.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (2 Cl, 2 rings): **61.898**.
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2 Cl, 1 OH, 1 ring): **38.1268**.

The target molecule has:
- More rings and Cl atoms than **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (higher value expected).
- Fewer Cl atoms but more OH groups than **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (value likely lower than 48.1468).
- Similar to **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** but with additional OH groups and one more Cl (value likely in the 50-60 range).

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is likely between **50 and 60**. A reasonable estimate is **55.0**, considering:
- The three Cl atoms contribute significantly.
- The two OH groups and ether linkage add to the polarity and size.
- The two aromatic rings increase the value compared to single-ring examples.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 55.0** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples).

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 25.10499999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property values appear to correlate with molecular weight or a similar physicochemical property (e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or a calculated descriptor like LogP). The molecule `CC/C=C\C` (trans-2-pentene) has the following structure and molecular weight:

- Molecular formula: C5H10  
- Molecular weight: 70.13 g/mol  

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (cis-2-butene, but the given formula is incorrect as it represents 2-pentene; likely a typo) has a property value of **25.105**.  
- `CCCC(=O)OC` (methyl butanoate) has a property value of **26.924**.  
- `CCCOC=O` (ethyl formate) has a property value of **22.307**.  

Given that `CC/C=C\C` (trans-2-pentene) is slightly larger than `CC/C=C/C` (assuming the latter is a typo for a smaller molecule), but smaller than `CCCC(=O)OC`, a reasonable interpolation suggests a value **between 25 and 30**.  

From the examples, the trend for simple alkenes/hydrocarbons seems to align with molecular weight or a related property scaled by a factor. For `C5H10`, a plausible prediction is:  

**Predicted property value: ~26.0**  

(Note: If the property is indeed molecular weight in some scaled form, the exact value may differ, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the given data.)

**Final answer: 26.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar examples).  

If more context or a specific property name were provided, the prediction could be refined.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 26.78399999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**:
   - **C** (methane): 6.731  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): 14.507  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 19.124  
   - **CC=C** (propene): Not given, but **CC#C** is 14.507, suggesting unsaturation increases the value slightly.  
   - **CCCC** (butane): Not given, but **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): 32.319, indicating cyclic structures have higher values.  

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 17.3548  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): 26.5888  
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): 31.471  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): 42.3985  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol): 34.6588 (ether + phenol)  

   Ethers (R-O-R') seem to have values in the range of ~30-40, depending on size and branching. For example:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (complex ether): 83.4777 (but this is a large molecule).  
   - **CCCOCC** is simpler, like diethyl ether.

3. **Size and Branching**:
   - Larger molecules generally have higher values, but branching can reduce the value slightly (e.g., **CC(C)O** vs. linear alcohols).  
   - **CCCOCC** has 5 carbons and an ether linkage, similar in size to **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (31.471) but without the ester group.  

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- It is a symmetrical ether with 5 carbons (C-O-C linkage).  
- Comparable to **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (31.471), but simpler (no ester).  
- Ethers like **COc1ccccc1O** (34.6588) have higher values due to aromaticity, so aliphatic ethers should be lower.  
- **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, 26.5888) is a similar-sized alcohol; ethers are typically slightly higher than analogous alcohols.  

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOCC** is:  
**~30.0** (likely between 28 and 32).  

### Final Answer:  
**30.5** (specific value based on interpolation of similar examples).  

---  
*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, etc.), this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. The value is likely in the 28-32 range.*

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 82.84470000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Weight and Complexity**: 
   - The molecule has two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2) and a tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)), which contribute significantly to its size and hydrophobicity.
   - It also contains a urea-like fragment (N(C(=O)N)), which adds polarity but is flanked by bulky aromatic groups.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 60.292): This is a simpler diphenylmethane derivative. The presence of the urea group and tertiary butyl in the target molecule would likely increase the property value due to added bulk and polarity.
   - **CN(C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23)c4ccccc4** (property = 63.0517): This has a similar urea fragment with a bulky cycloalkyl group instead of a phenyl ring. The target molecule's phenyl rings are similarly bulky, so the value should be comparable.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 84.967): This has a more complex heterocyclic system, which increases the property value. The target molecule is less complex but still has significant bulk.

3. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The urea group (N(C=O)N) is polar but is "shielded" by the two phenyl rings and the tertiary butyl group, reducing its overall impact on the property. This is similar to how the urea group in **CN(C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23)c4ccccc4** is shielded by bulky groups.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above comparisons, the property value for **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is likely slightly higher than **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (60.292) but lower than **CN(C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23)c4ccccc4** (63.0517) due to the balance between bulk and polarity. 

**Predicted Property Value: 62.5** (approximate, likely between 61 and 63 based on the examples). 

For a more precise estimate, I would lean toward **62.3**, as the tertiary butyl group adds slightly more bulk than the cycloalkyl system in the 63.0517 example but less than the heterocyclic system in the 84.967 example.

### Final Answer:
**62.3**

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 48.445700000000016
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight and Size**: Larger molecules (more atoms/heavier elements) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CO** (small, simple) → 8.1428
   - **CCCCSP(=O)(SCCCC)SCCCC** (large, complex) → 89.7045

2. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Bromine (Br)**: Adds significant weight and increases the property value. For example:
     - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** → 34.1
     - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** → 35.8068
   - **Amide (N-C=O)**: Adds moderate weight and increases the value. For example:
     - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** → 48.3414
   - **Aromatic Rings**: Base value for benzene-like structures is ~30-40, increasing with substituents.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (phenol with Br) → 35.8068
   - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (toluene with NH2) → 35.5914
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) → 35.999

### Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- This is **N-acetyl-4-bromoaniline**, with:
  - An aromatic ring (base ~35-40).
  - A bromine substituent (adds ~5-10, similar to other Br-substituted aromatics).
  - An amide group (N-C=O, adds ~10-15 compared to simple aromatics).

### Comparison:
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (phenol + Br) → 35.8068  
  Here, the OH is replaced with NHC(=O)CH3 (amide), which is heavier and more polar. This should increase the value.
- **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (complex amide + aromatics) → 82.8447  
  This is much larger, but shows amides contribute significantly.
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic diamide) → 48.3414  
  Simpler amide structure, closer in size to our target.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** should be higher than **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (35.8068) but lower than the cyclic diamide (48.3414). A reasonable estimate is **~45-50**. 

Looking at the substituent effects:
- Base aromatic + Br: ~35-40  
- Adding N-acetyl (N-C=O): ~+10  
- Total: ~45-50  

A precise estimate is **47.5**, but rounding to match the given examples' precision:  
**Predicted property value: 47.2**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. The actual property may depend on additional factors not evident from the given data.)

**Final Answer: 47.2**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 44.98400000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Benzene Rings (Aromatic Systems)**:
   - Molecules with a benzene ring (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`, `CCc1ccc(C)cc1`) tend to have property values in the range of **35–40**.
   - Substitutions on the benzene ring (e.g., alkyl groups, halogens, nitro groups) can increase or decrease the value slightly.

2. **Alkyl Substitutions**:
   - Adding alkyl groups (e.g., `CC(C)CO`, `CCCC(C)O`) tends to increase the property value compared to simpler hydrocarbons.
   - For example:
     - `CC1CCCCC1` (no benzene) has a value of **32.249**.
     - `Cc1ccccc1` (benzene with one methyl) has a value of **~35–36** (not explicitly given, but similar to `C=Cc1ccccc1` at **36.533**).
     - `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (benzene with two alkyl groups) has a value of **40.557**.

3. **Combined Alkyl and Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` is similar to `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` but with a branched alkyl group (`CC(C)C-`) instead of a linear one (`CC-`).
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., `CC(C)CO` at **21.9238**) tend to slightly lower the property value compared to linear ones (e.g., `CCCC(C)O` at **26.5888**).

4. **Prediction**:
   - `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` has a value of **40.557**.
   - Replacing the linear `CC-` with a branched `CC(C)C-` would likely reduce the value slightly (by ~2–3 units) due to reduced molecular linearity.
   - Thus, a reasonable estimate for `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` would be **~37–39**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the examples and trends, the predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is approximately **38.5**. 

However, looking closely at similar structures:
- `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (naphthalene with one methyl) has a value of **48.685**, but this is a fused ring system.
- `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (two alkyl substitutions) is **40.557**.
- `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (branched alkyl + methyl on benzene) is **45.268**.

Given that `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` has one branched alkyl group and no additional substitutions, a value closer to **40** is more plausible. 

### Adjusted Prediction:
**40.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the given examples). 

However, since `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` is **40.557** and `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` is **45.268**, the absence of a second methyl in `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` suggests a value slightly lower than **40.557**. 

Thus, a refined estimate is **39.5**. 

### Final Answer:
**39.5** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

For higher precision, if we average the closest analogs (`CCc1ccc(C)cc1` at **40.557** and `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` at **45.268**), the midpoint is ~42.9, but this is likely too high. Instead, weighting toward the simpler `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` structure, **39.5** is reasonable. 

However, looking back at `C=Cc1ccccc1` (one vinyl group) at **36.533** and `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (two alkyls) at **40.557**, the addition of a branched alkyl (`CC(C)C-`) instead of linear (`CC-`) might suggest a value slightly below **40.557**, say **39.0**.

After reconsideration, the most consistent prediction is:  
**39.2** (reflecting a slight reduction due to branching compared to linear alkyls). 

But to align with the given examples' precision (often to 4 decimal places), I'll provide:  
**39.2000**. 

However, since the question asks for a "specific property value" and many examples are given to 4 decimal places, but no strict pattern is clear, I'll simplify to:  
**39.2**. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**39.2** (approximate). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more explicit rules, this is an educated estimate based on structural similarity.)

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 31.829499999999992
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can help estimate the value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic compounds with small substituents** tend to have property values in the **30-40 range**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): 32.994  
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (paracetamol-like): 36.6247  
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 39.7508  

2. **Benzene with a single polar substituent** (e.g., -CHO, -NO2, -OH) typically falls in this range.  
   - The **aldehyde group (-CHO)** is moderately polar but less bulky than nitro or hydroxyl groups.

3. **Benzene with an aldehyde group** (benzaldehyde) is structurally similar to:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (36.6247), but without the -OH and -NHCO groups.  
   - **COc1ccccc1** (32.994), but with a slightly more polar -CHO instead of -OCH3.  

4. The **-CHO group** is less polar than -NO2 but more polar than -OCH3, so the value should be **between 32.994 and 36.6247**, likely closer to the lower end because -CHO is less polar than -NHCO or -NO2.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) should have a property value of approximately **34.5**.  

### Final Answer:
**34.5**

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 53.201100000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, aromatic rings, amides, halogens, etc.).

### Key features of the molecule:
1. **Bicyclic structure**: The molecule contains a fused 5- and 6-membered ring system with two amide (N-C=O) groups, indicating rigidity and polarity.
2. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly polar and electron-withdrawing group, which tends to increase the property value (as seen in examples like `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` with a value of 69.6324).
3. **Aromatic ring with heteroatoms**: The presence of an aromatic ring (benzene-like) with an oxygen heteroatom (o1) and a nitro group adds to the complexity.
4. **Amide groups (N-C=O)**: These are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the property value.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles a combination of:
  - `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (value: 41.8447), but with additional nitro and amide groups.
  - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (value: 82.8447), which has multiple amides and aromatic rings.
  - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (value: 69.6324), which has a nitro group and aromatic rings.

Given the **bicyclic core, two amide groups, and a nitro group**, the property value is likely higher than simpler nitro-aromatics but lower than very large or highly substituted systems (e.g., steroids or polycyclic aromatics). 

### Predicted value:
A reasonable estimate is **~65–75**, leaning toward the higher end due to the nitro group and multiple amides. 

**Final prediction: 71.5** (interpolated based on similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 60.129400000000025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **30.8544**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **57.06**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond (hydrazine derivative vs. azo compound).

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - Single-bonded nitrogen (e.g., in **Nc1ccccc1**) tends to lower the property value compared to double-bonded nitrogen (e.g., in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**).
   - The property value increases when additional aromatic rings or conjugated systems are introduced (e.g., **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** at 57.06 vs. **Nc1ccccc1** at 30.8544).

3. **Comparison to **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2****:
   - This molecule is a **diphenylhydrazine** derivative, with two phenyl groups attached to a hydrazine core (N-N single bond). 
   - It is less conjugated than **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azo compound), so its property value should be lower than 57.06 but higher than **Nc1ccccc1** (30.8544) due to the additional phenyl ring.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (57.06) but with reduced conjugation (single N-N bond), a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower. 

A plausible prediction for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**~52.0** (interpolated between 30.8544 and 57.06, accounting for the reduced conjugation but increased size compared to aniline).

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 42.582400000000014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), forming a cyclic diamide (imide-like structure).
   - A cyclopentane ring (**CCCC1**) fused to the imide.
   - The molecule is a bicyclic system with a 5-membered and a 6-membered ring (similar to a succinimide derivative with a cyclopentane ring).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The presence of two polar amide groups increases polarity.
   - The bicyclic structure adds rigidity and moderate size (similar to some of the mid-range examples).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 58.4774): This is a similar imide with additional alkyl chains. Our molecule is simpler but has a fused cyclopentane ring, which may slightly increase the property due to rigidity.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not in the list, but simpler imides like this would likely have lower values).
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 48.3414): A similar cyclic diamide but with less rigidity and smaller size.

### Prediction:
Given the fused ring system and two amide groups, the property value is likely higher than simpler imides (e.g., ~50) but lower than larger or more polar examples (e.g., ~70). A reasonable estimate is between **50 and 60**.

From the examples, the closest match is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (58.4774). Our molecule is slightly less bulky but has a fused ring, so the value should be similar or slightly lower.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 55.0** (approximate, likely in the range of 53–57). 

(Note: Without a clear trend or explicit model, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity to the provided examples.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 66.90800000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight and Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple heavy atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, I) or large aromatic systems tend to have higher property values. 
   - For example:
     - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **36.462**.
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl) has a property value of **85.037**.
     - **Ic1ccccc1** (iodobenzene) has a property value of **39.159**.

2. **Symmetry and Aromatic Systems**:
   - Symmetrical polyaromatic or polychlorinated systems (e.g., biphenyls, naphthalenes) tend to have higher values. 
   - For example:
     - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of **72.19**.

3. **Specific Case for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**:
   - This is a **dichlorobiphenyl** structure (two benzene rings linked, with three chlorine substituents: two on one ring and one on the other). 
   - It is less chlorinated than the example **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 85.037) but more chlorinated than **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (property = 36.462).
   - The symmetry and additional chlorine substituents suggest a higher value than dichlorobenzene but lower than the heavily chlorinated biphenyl example.

### Prediction:
Given the structure and the trends:
- The property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is likely between **50 and 70**, closer to the lower end due to fewer chlorines than the 85.037 example. 
- A reasonable estimate is **~65.0**, considering its similarity to other polychlorinated aromatics in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 65.0** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples).

   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 54.288  
   - **C=CC=O** (acrolein): 16.261  
   - **C1CCOC1** (oxetane): 20.053  

   These suggest that simple aromatic or aliphatic structures without polar or bulky substituents tend to have property values in the range of ~20–55, with larger/aliphatic chains increasing the value.

2. **Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): 31.8295  
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 81.938  
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (trichlorophenol): 43.1368  

   Halogenation or polar substituents (e.g., Cl, OH) increase the property value, especially with multiple substitutions.

3. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - **CCCCOC** (butyl methyl ether): 26.784  
   - **CCCC(=O)OC** (methyl butyrate): 26.924  
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate): 40.775  

   Linear aliphatic chains with moderate polarity (e.g., esters, ethers) fall in the ~20–40 range.

4. **Diethylbenzene Analysis**:
   - The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is diethylbenzene, a simple aromatic with two ethyl groups. It is structurally similar to:
     - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene, 54.288), but with two shorter chains (ethyl instead of hexyl).
     - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline, 35.5914), but with non-polar ethyl groups instead of a polar NH2 group.

   Given that:
   - Hexylbenzene (54.288) has a longer aliphatic chain, increasing the value.
   - Methylaniline (35.5914) has a polar group, which may not directly compare.
   - Ethylbenzene (not in the list, but analogous to methylbenzene/toluene) would likely be ~30–40.

   Diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups, which are less polar than an NH2 group but more bulky than a single hexyl chain. The property value is likely between 40 and 50, closer to hexylbenzene but slightly lower due to shorter chains.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is approximately **45.0**. 

This is based on:
- Simplicity of the aromatic core.
- Two ethyl groups adding bulk but no significant polarity.
- Comparison to hexylbenzene (54.288) and methylaniline (35.5914), placing diethylbenzene in the middle.

### Final Answer:
**45.0**

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 42.2276
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Values**:
   - Molecules with **nitro groups (NO₂)** tend to have moderate property values (e.g., 37.5088 for Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, 44.4878 for Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O).
   - **Sulfonamide groups (S(=O)(=O)N)** are present in some molecules, and they often contribute to higher property values due to their polarity and size (e.g., 73.5542 for c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1, which has a sulfonamide-like fragment).
   - **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., NO₂, SO₂NH₂) increase the property value compared to simple aromatic systems (e.g., Cc1ccccc1 has 31.179, while nitro-substituted aromatics are higher).

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (aniline with a nitro group) has a property value of **37.5088**.
   - The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** replaces the nitro group with a **sulfonamide group (SO₂NH₂)**, which is bulkier and more polar. This suggests the property value should be higher than 37.5088 but not excessively so (since sulfonamides are not as extreme as large polycyclic systems).

3. **Examples with Sulfur-Containing Groups**:
   - Molecules with sulfur (e.g., thiophenes, sulfides) have moderate values (e.g., 41.842 for Brc1cccc(Br)c1, which is a simple aromatic with halogens).
   - The sulfonamide group is more polar than a nitro group, so we expect a higher value than 37.5088 but less than 50 (since larger or more complex systems reach higher values).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The base molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **37.5088**,
- Replacing NO₂ with SO₂NH₂ (more polar and bulky) should increase the value,
- But not as high as polycyclic or very large systems (which exceed 50),

A reasonable estimate is **~42-45**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is **42.5**.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 68.37800000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It can be described as a **tetracene** or a **benz[a]anthracene-like structure** (specifically, it is **triphenylene**, a symmetric PAH with three fused rings in a linear arrangement and a fourth ring fused perpendicularly). 

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (83.697) and **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (85.884) are both PAHs with 4-5 fused rings, and their property values are high (~83-86). 
   - The given molecule is similar in size and aromaticity but lacks substituents (like methyl or halogens) that might alter the property.

2. **Smaller Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (66.191) is a smaller PAH (3 fused rings), and its value is lower. 
   - The given molecule is larger, so we expect a higher value.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule is fully conjugated and symmetric, which typically increases the property value compared to less symmetric or smaller PAHs.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, the property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** should be **~85-86**, similar to the other 4-ring PAHs in the dataset. 

### Final Answer:
**85.884** (matching the value of the structurally similar example **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**). 

This is consistent with the trend that larger, fully conjugated aromatic systems have higher property values in the given data.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 71.85970000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), an aromatic ring, and a carbonyl group (C=O). These polar groups suggest moderate to high property values, as seen in similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** with 87.0368).
2. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is relatively large with fused rings and multiple substituents, which typically correlates with higher property values (e.g., **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** with 141.5886).
3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: The extended conjugation and symmetry may stabilize the molecule, but the presence of multiple -OH groups increases polarity.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (87.0368): Similar size and polarity, but fewer -OH groups.
- **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (87.9531): Very similar in structure (fused rings, -OH, carbonyl) and size.
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (29.7716): Smaller and simpler, with just two -OH groups.

Given the structural similarity to **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (87.9531), but with additional -OH groups increasing polarity, the property value should be slightly higher.

### Predicted Property Value:
**89.5** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the dataset's precision). 

This accounts for the additional hydroxyl groups and their impact on the property compared to the most similar example.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 41.94720000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight and Complexity**: Generally, larger and more complex molecules (e.g., with multiple functional groups, rings, or halogens) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - Simple alkanes like `CCCCC` have low values (~25.199).
   - Molecules with phosphorus (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) or multiple halogens have high values (~70.403).
   - Steroids or fused ring systems (e.g., `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`) have very high values (~92.264).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., `P(=O)`, `P(=S)`) significantly increase the property value.
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) also contribute to higher values.
   - Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., nitro, amide) moderately increase the value.
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., ethers, esters) have variable effects depending on context.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: 70.403 (P=S, multiple Cl, aromatic).
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: 78.0115 (P=O, multiple Cl, aromatic).
   - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`: 94.255 (P=S, amide, long chain).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**:
- Contains a **phosphoryl group (P=O)** and a **thioester (SC)**, which are electronegative and polar.
- Has an **amide group (NC(C)=O)**, which adds moderate complexity.
- No halogens or aromatic rings, but the phosphorus and sulfur atoms are heavy and polar.
- Structurally similar to `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (78.0115), but without the aromatic ring and halogens. The absence of these features would likely reduce the value.

### Comparison:
- The presence of P=O and SC suggests a value higher than simple alkanes but lower than heavily halogenated or aromatic phosphorus compounds.
- Similar molecules with P=O and moderate complexity (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: 78.0115) suggest a range of ~60-80.
- Without halogens or aromaticity, the value should be on the lower end of this range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is:  
**~65.0** (specific value: **65.2**). 

This balances the contributions from the P=O, amide, and thioester groups while accounting for the lack of halogens or aromaticity.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 20.845999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Small, simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., CCCCO, CCC(C)C) have property values in the range of **20-30**.
2. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) have higher values (e.g., 81.938), but this is likely due to their size and multiple chlorines.
3. **Simple chlorinated aliphatic compounds** (e.g., Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has one chlorine and an aromatic ring) have values around **35-40**.
4. **Small halogenated alkenes/aliphatics** (e.g., CCBr has a value of 19.468, CCCCBr has 28.702) suggest that halogens increase the property value modestly compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Analysis of Cl\C=C/Cl:
- This is a small molecule with two chlorines and a double bond (C=C). 
- It is smaller and simpler than most chlorinated examples in the dataset, but the presence of two chlorines will likely increase the property value compared to non-halogenated small molecules (e.g., CCC=O has 16.355).
- Comparing to CCBr (19.468) and CCCCBr (28.702), the addition of a second chlorine and a double bond (which may slightly increase polarity) would likely place the value in the **25-35** range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is **28.5**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, boiling point, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 24.236999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Rings**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): 35.9887
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon): 87.652
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused heteroaromatic): 57.044
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (another polycyclic aromatic): 78.96

   Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values in the 30-40 range, while larger or more complex fused aromatic systems have higher values.

2. **Heteroatom Influence**:
   - **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 33.1168
   - **Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 34.7612
   - **COc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 39.6484
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: 35.9887

   Heteroatoms (N, O) in aromatic rings slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect is not drastic unless the molecule is highly substituted or fused.

3. **Pyridine vs. Benzene**:
   - Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is a 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen replacing a CH group in benzene. From the examples, benzene derivatives with simple substituents (e.g., **CNc1ccccc1**) are around 35-40. Pyridine is structurally similar but has a nitrogen, which may slightly increase the property due to its electronegativity and polarity.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused pyridine-like system): 57.044
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (a fused diazine): 39.865

   The fused systems have higher values, but simple pyridine should be lower, likely in the 30-40 range.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Benzene derivatives with simple substituents are ~35-40.
- Pyridine is slightly more polar than benzene but not as complex as fused systems.
- The presence of nitrogen likely increases the value modestly compared to benzene (which would likely be ~30-35 if it were in the examples).

A reasonable estimate for **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)** is **~32-36**. Looking at the examples, **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) is 35.9887, and pyridine is simpler (no methyl or amino group), so slightly lower.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: 34.5** (approximate, likely between 32 and 36 based on trends).

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 99.85280000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Polar groups**: Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO`), an ester (`COC(=O)`), an aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3`), and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc`).
2. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large with fused aromatic systems and multiple substituents, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., the last few molecules with values >60).
3. **Functional group contributions**:
   - The ester and hydroxyl groups contribute to polarity (similar to examples with values ~40-60).
   - The chloro-aromatic and fused ring systems increase the value (similar to examples like `c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34` with a value of 70.146 or `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` with 65.5254).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles a combination of:
  - `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (65.5254): This has two aromatic amines and a carbonyl, but our molecule has additional complexity (chloro-substitution, ester, and hydroxyls).
  - `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(C)Oc1cccc2ccccc12` (81.966): This has a fused aromatic system and polar groups, similar to our molecule but with fewer polar substituents.
  - `c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34` (70.146): This is a pure polyaromatic hydrocarbon, while our molecule has additional polar groups.

Given the larger size, more polar groups, and fused aromatic systems, the value should be **higher than 65.5254** but likely **less than 81.966** due to fewer fused rings. A reasonable estimate is around **75.0**, considering the balance of polarity and complexity.

### Final predicted property value:
**75.0** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the examples).

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 26.61079999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (butylbenzene): 40.437  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): 49.601  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 47.646  
   Hydrocarbons with longer or branched chains tend to have property values in the 40-50 range.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole-like structures): Values vary, but oxygen increases the property compared to pure hydrocarbons.  
   - **CC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol): 35.7528  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): 38.3258  
   Alcohols (OH group) tend to have property values in the 35-40 range, but this depends on the rest of the structure.

3. **Chain Length and Polarity**:
   - Longer chains with polar groups (e.g., OH) can increase the property value slightly compared to shorter chains.  
   - **CCCCCO** is a 5-carbon chain with a terminal OH group, similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, 38.3258) but linear.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- It is a linear alcohol with 5 carbons, so its property value should be slightly higher than **CC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol, 35.7528) but comparable to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, 38.3258).  
- The linearity may reduce the value slightly compared to cyclic alcohols.  
- Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **~37-39**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**38.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, boiling point, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing value with size/polarity.)

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 67.51050000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **fused ring system** (5-membered ring with a sulfur and oxygen) and a **benzene ring** attached via an amide group (`C(=O)N`). 
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Sulfonyl group (`S(=O)(=O)`), which is polar and contributes to higher property values.
   - Amide (`C(=O)N`), which is also polar and increases the property value.
   - Ether linkage (`CCO1`), which adds some polarity but less than sulfonyl or amide.
   - Aromatic ring (`c2ccccc2`), which contributes to the bulkiness and moderate property values.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Sulfonyl-Containing Molecules**:
  - `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` has a property value of **91.8042**. This molecule has a phosphorothioate, an ester, and an aromatic ring, similar in complexity to our target molecule but with more bulky groups.
  - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **71.2614**, which is slightly less due to fewer polar groups.
- **Amide + Aromatic Systems**:
  - `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of **70.3384**, which is close due to the amide and two aromatic rings.
  - `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` has a value of **60.7028**, but lacks the sulfonyl group.
- **Sulfonyl + Aromatic Systems**:
  - `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` has a value of **46.872**, but it lacks the amide and has a simpler structure.

### Estimation:
Given the presence of both a **sulfonyl group** and an **amide** linked to an aromatic ring, the property value should be higher than simpler aromatic amides (e.g., ~60-70) but slightly lower than very bulky sulfonyl-containing molecules (e.g., ~90). 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **75-85**. Considering the balance of polar groups and moderate size, I predict:

**Predicted Property Value: 78.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples like `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`). 

For a more precise prediction, additional data or a model would be needed, but this is a reasonable estimate given the examples.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 88.40510000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I'll analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, complexity, and functional groups (e.g., aromatic rings, nitro groups, esters, etc.). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), similar to examples like `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 37.8334) but more complex.
2. **Lactam/imide-like core**: The structure includes a cyclic amide/imide (`C1=C(C)NC(=C...)`), which adds complexity.
3. **Two ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`)**: This is more complex than molecules with single esters like `CCCCC(=O)OC` (property = 31.541).
4. **Branched alkyl groups (`C(C)`)**: Adds to the molecular weight but not as significantly as aromatic/functional groups.
5. **Nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)**: Present in some examples (e.g., `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`, property = 77.5478), but this molecule has only one nitro group.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is more complex than `CC(C)c1ccccc1` (property = 40.531) due to the nitro group and additional ester/imide functionalities.
- It is less complex than `CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` (property = 89.463), which has multiple rings and heteroatoms.
- Closer to `OC4=C(C1CCC(CC1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(=O)c3ccccc3C4=O` (property = 100.9088) in terms of fused rings and functional groups, but without the fused polycyclic core.

### Estimated Property:
Given the above, the property likely falls between **70 and 80**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: 75.5**  
(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity to the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 33.3484
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **cyclic imide** with two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to nitrogen (N), forming a 5-membered ring (including the nitrogen). 
2. It also contains a **cyclopropane ring (C1(CC1))** fused to the imide ring, adding rigidity and some steric bulk.
3. The presence of multiple polar carbonyl groups and nitrogen suggests moderate to high polarity, but the small size and rigidity may limit the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **c1ccncc1 (24.237)**: A simple pyridine ring, less polar and smaller.
- **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (96.881)**: A large, complex steroid-like structure with multiple rings and polar groups.
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (36.0961)**: A purine-like structure with multiple nitrogens but smaller than our target.
- **CC(=O)SC4CC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C5CCC2(C)C(CCC23CCC(=O)O3)C45 (112.21)**: A very large, multi-ring system with polar groups.

Our molecule is **smaller than the steroids but more polar than simple heterocycles like pyridine or purine**. It is somewhat analogous to **cyclic amides/imides** (e.g., succinimide derivatives), which often have property values in the **40–60 range**.

### Key Observations:
1. The **cyclopropane ring** adds rigidity but not much bulk.
2. The **two carbonyls and nitrogens** contribute polarity.
3. The **small size** prevents the value from being too high.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is **~45–50**. Looking at the examples, **48.958 (Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1)** and **51.648 (Brc1cccc2ccccc12)** are somewhat comparable in size/polarity, but our molecule is more polar due to the imide. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**48.5** (rounded to one decimal place). 

### Final Answer:
**48.5**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 16.394000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Simple alkanes and substituted alkanes**: 
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a property value of **25.199**.
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane) has a value of **34.363**.
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene) has a value of **22.991**.
   - **C1CCC=CCC1** (cycloheptene) has a value of **32.225**.

   These suggest that simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes) tend to have property values in the **20–35** range.

2. **Chlorinated compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **31.452**.
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (a highly chlorinated polycyclic) has a value of **78.054**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene) has a value of **46.482**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a value of **44.169**.

   Chlorine substitution tends to increase the property value compared to the parent hydrocarbon, with more chlorines leading to higher values.

3. **Small chlorinated alkanes**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is a simple chlorinated alkane with only one chlorine. 
   - Comparing to **CC#N** (acetonitrile, a small polar molecule), which has a value of **11.287**, and **c1ccoc1** (furan, a small heterocycle), which has a value of **18.708**, we can infer that small molecules with one heteroatom or substituent tend to have values in the **10–20** range.

4. **Estimate for ClCC**:
   - Since **ClCC** is smaller than chlorobenzene (31.452) and simpler than most of the chlorinated examples, but more polar than **CCCCC** (25.199), its value should be lower than chlorobenzene but higher than very small non-polar molecules like **CC#N** (11.287).
   - A reasonable estimate would be in the **15–25** range, leaning toward the lower end due to its small size.

**Predicted property value for ClCC: 18.5** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 48.484000000000016
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl)** group and a **chlorine atom (Cl)** on the aromatic ring. 
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Trichloromethyl group (**CCl3**) is highly polar and bulky.
   - Chlorine atom on the aromatic ring adds polarity and molecular weight.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 85.037): This has two aromatic rings with multiple chlorines and a **CCl3** group. The predicted molecule is smaller (one ring instead of two) but has similar substituents.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 66.908): This has two aromatic rings with chlorines but lacks the **CCl3** group.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (property = 74.729): This has a **CCl3** group but a more complex heterocyclic system.

### Property Prediction:
Given the presence of the **CCl3** group and a single aromatic ring with a chlorine, the property value should be **lower than 85.037** (due to fewer rings) but **higher than 66.908** (due to the **CCl3** group's contribution). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **70–75**. Considering the simplicity of the pyridine ring compared to the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 72.5** (approximate, likely between 70 and 75). 

However, looking more closely at the trend:
- The **CCl3** group seems to add ~15–20 units compared to similar structures without it (e.g., 66.908 vs. 85.037 for two-ring systems). 
- For a single-ring system with **CCl3**, a value in the **low 70s** seems plausible.

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**72.3** (but since the examples suggest higher precision, I'll round to one decimal place). 

Given the data, the most consistent estimate is:  
**72.5** (but likely closer to **72.3** if interpolating). 

However, observing that **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (with **CCl3** and a complex heterocycle) is **74.729**, a simpler **pyridine + CCl3** might be slightly lower. 

Final prediction:  
**72.3** (or **72.5** if rounding). 

Given the examples, I'll settle on:  
**72.4**. 

But to match the precision of the given data (4 decimal places), I'll provide:  
**72.4000**. 

However, since the examples with **CCl3** are ~74–85, and single-ring systems with fewer chlorines are ~50–60, a value of **~72** is reasonable. 

Thus, the predicted property for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is:  
**72.4000**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarity.)

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 31.205799999999982
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (hexan-3-ol): 35.8228
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): 37.0758
   - **CC(O)CCC** (butan-2-ol): Not explicitly given, but similar alcohols are in the 30-40 range.
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methylpentan-1-ol): 31.1578

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have higher values (e.g., **CCCCCCCCl**: 39.479 vs. **CCCCCl**: not given but likely lower).
   - Branching tends to slightly lower the value (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO**: 31.1578 vs. linear alcohols ~35).

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of -OH increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**: 31.179 vs. **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: 37.0758).

### Analysis of **CCCCC(C)O**:
- This is 2-hexanol, a branched alcohol with 6 carbons.
- It is structurally similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methylpentan-1-ol, 31.1578) but with one additional carbon and the -OH group on the second carbon instead of the terminal one.
- Compared to **CCCC(O)CCC** (hexan-3-ol, 35.8228), the branching in **CCCCC(C)O** might slightly reduce the value, but the extra carbon could offset this.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCC(C)O** would be slightly higher than **CCC(C)CCO** (31.1578) but lower than **CCCC(O)CCC** (35.8228). A good intermediate value is **~34.5**.

However, looking more closely:
- The branching effect is modest, and the additional carbon likely brings it closer to **CCCC(O)CCC** (35.8228). 
- A more precise estimate would be **~35.0**, considering the similarity to hexan-3-ol but with slight branching.

### Final Prediction:
**35.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the given data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that the values correlate with molecular size, polarity, and branching, as is common for properties like boiling point, molar refractivity, or partition coefficients.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 41.842000000000006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property value = **61.898**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl): Property value = **61.898** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, suggesting symmetry or similar contributions).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property value = **38.1268** (lower due to the presence of -OH).
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O**: Property value = **83.6841** (higher due to additional complex substituents).

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane): Property value = **16.573**.
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform): Property value = **21.347**.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride): Property value = **30.988**.
   - **CI** (iodomethane): Property value = **19.944**.
   - **Br** is heavier and more polarizable than Cl, so brominated analogs might have slightly higher property values than chlorinated ones.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Patterns**:
   - Symmetric dihalogenated benzenes (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) have higher values than monosubstituted or asymmetric ones.
   - The property seems to increase with the number of halogens and molecular weight.

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- This is the brominated analog of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (property = 61.898). 
- Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, so the property value should be slightly higher.
- The symmetric substitution (para-position) also suggests a value in the same range as 1,4-dichlorobenzene but adjusted for the bromine effect.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** to be approximately **~65-70**. A reasonable estimate is **66.5**.

### Final Answer:
**66.5**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 81.938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples.

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl derivative** with **chlorine atoms** on both aromatic rings. 
2. It is structurally similar to the second example in the list:  
   **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which has a property value of **101.978**.  
   However, the given molecule has **fewer chlorine substitutions** (7 Cl atoms instead of 10 in the example).

3. The presence of **multiple chlorines** increases the property value due to higher molecular weight and increased polarizability.  
4. The **biphenyl core** contributes significantly to the property, as seen in other aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** has a value of **87.652**).

### Comparison:
- The example with **10 chlorines** has a value of **101.978**.  
- The given molecule has **7 chlorines**, so we expect a **lower but still high value** due to the biphenyl structure and multiple chlorines.  
- Another comparable example is **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon), which has a value of **88.434**.  

### Prediction:
Given the **reduced chlorine count** but still significant aromaticity and halogenation, the property value should be **slightly lower than 101.978 but higher than 88.434**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**≈ 95.0**  

### Final Answer:
**95.0** (predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl)

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 103.02750000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property values in the examples seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight (though not strictly linear). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic rings and substitutions**: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (especially fused or substituted) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 83.697 for a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon).  
2. **Phosphorus-containing groups**: Molecules with P=O or P=S (e.g., 96.578 for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**) have high values.  
3. **Polar functional groups**: Ethers, esters, and halogens increase the property value (e.g., 88.121 for **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**).  
4. **Molecular size**: Larger molecules (e.g., steroids or multi-ring systems) have higher values (e.g., 98.5326 for a complex steroid).  

### Analysis of the given molecule:
The molecule is **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, which has:
- A central **phosphate group (P=O)** linked to two aromatic rings (**Oc2cccc(C)c2** and **Oc3ccccc3C**).  
- Three aromatic rings in total (one central and two side chains).  
- Methyl (**C**) substitutions on the aromatic rings.  
- Ether (**O**) linkages.  

This structure is highly complex, with multiple aromatic systems and a phosphate group, similar to some of the highest-valued examples (e.g., 96.578 for a phosphorus-containing molecule).  

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** (high contribution),  
- Three **aromatic rings**,  
- **Ether linkages** and **methyl substitutions**,  
- Overall **high molecular weight and polarity**,  

the property value should be **close to or above 90**, similar to other phosphorus-containing or multi-aromatic systems in the examples.  

### Final predicted value:
**94.5** (approximating based on comparable examples).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 67.64800000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and bulky group, which often increases the property value (e.g., see `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` with 80.241, where multiple halogens increase the value).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The presence of a benzene ring with substitutions (CF3 and a heterocyclic group) is common in the examples, with values typically in the 30-80 range depending on other features.
3. **Heterocyclic group with Cl and C=O**: The `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` moiety introduces polarity, halogenation (Cl), and a carbonyl group (C=O), which can increase the property value (similar to `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 76.928 or `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` with 80.241).
4. **Multiple halogens (F and Cl)**: Halogens generally increase the property value due to their electronegativity and mass (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 86.948).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is more complex than simple aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C` with 35.916) but less heavily halogenated than the highest examples (e.g., `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl` with 92.096).
- It resembles `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (80.241) but with CF3 instead of Cl on the aromatic ring and a slightly less bulky heterocycle.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of the CF3 group, aromaticity, and multiple halogens (F and Cl), the predicted value is likely in the **mid-to-high 70s**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**78.5** (similar to `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` with 78.552, which also has multiple halogens and a polar group). 

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 39.64840000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule consists of a benzene ring with two substituents:
   - A methoxy group (**OCH3**) at one position.
   - A nitro group (**NO2**, represented as **N(=O)=O**) at another position.
2. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The nitro group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
   - The methoxy group is moderately polar and electron-donating.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of **39.7508**. This is a benzene with two nitro groups, which are highly polar.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a property value of **28.1068**. This is a benzene with a hydroxyl group, which is polar but less so than a nitro group.
   - **Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2** (a fused heterocyclic system with an oxygen and nitrogen) has a property value of **43.4078**.

### Reasoning:
- The presence of the nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) will significantly increase the property value compared to phenol due to its stronger polarity and electron-withdrawing nature.
- The methoxy group (**OCH3**) is less polar than a nitro group but more polar than a simple alkyl group. It will contribute to the property value but not as much as the nitro group.
- Compared to dinitrobenzene (39.7508), our molecule has only one nitro group and a methoxy group, so the value should be lower than 39.7508 but higher than phenol (28.1068).
- The fused heterocyclic example (43.4078) is higher due to additional ring strain and nitrogen, but our molecule is simpler.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** would be between **35 and 40**. Considering the balance between the nitro and methoxy groups, a good prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 38.5**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and structural trends. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being measured, such as logP, polar surface area, or another descriptor.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 81.21600000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Heavy Chlorination**: The molecule is highly chlorinated (8 chlorine atoms), which significantly increases its molecular weight and likely its property value. 
   - Compare to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane, property = 57.846). This has 6 Cl atoms and a value of ~58. Our molecule has 8 Cl atoms, so we expect a higher value.
   - Another example: **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorocatechol, property = 48.1468). Our molecule has twice as many Cl atoms and a more complex polycyclic structure.

2. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule is a polycyclic chlorinated hydrocarbon (similar to steroids or adamantanes in complexity but with more Cl atoms). 
   - Compare to **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like structure, property = 100.021). While our molecule lacks carbonyl groups, its polycyclic + heavy Cl substitution suggests a high value, though likely lower than 100 due to no polar groups like C=O.

3. **Bulkiness**: The steric bulk from the Cl atoms and rigid polycyclic framework will further increase the property value beyond simple linear or monocyclic chlorinated compounds (e.g., **ClCCCl** = 21.44).

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value should be:
- Higher than **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (57.846) due to 2 additional Cl atoms and more rings.
- Lower than **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (100.021) due to lack of polar carbonyl groups.
- Likely in the range of **70–90** based on the examples.

A reasonable estimate is **~78.5**, considering the balance between Cl substitution (increasing value) and lack of other polar functionalities (limiting value).

### Final Answer:
**78.5** (predicted property value).

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 22.306999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Weight and Size**: Larger molecules tend to have higher property values (e.g., `C1CCCCCC1` (cycloheptane) has a value of 32.319, while `CCCCCCC#C` (1-octyne) has 37.592). Smaller molecules like `CC#N` (acetonitrile) have lower values (11.287).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Ethers (`COC`, `CCOC`) tend to have moderate values (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...` has 138.3454, but this is a very large molecule).
   - Esters (`COC=O`) are present in molecules like `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (46.8109) and `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` (83.4777), with values increasing with size.
   - Simple aldehydes/esters like `CCCOC=O` (propyl formate) are not explicitly in the examples, but similar small esters (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`) have values around 40-50.
3. **Polarity and Heteroatoms**: The presence of oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N) tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCC#C` (19.124) vs. `CC#N` (11.287), but this is not a strict rule.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
- This is a small ester (propyl formate) with 4 carbons and 2 oxygens. 
- Similar small esters in the examples:
  - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): 46.8109.
  - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` (larger ester): 83.4777.
- The molecule `CCCOC=O` is smaller and simpler than these, so its value should be lower. 
- Comparing to other small polar molecules:
  - `CC(=O)N` (acetamide): Not directly in examples, but `NC(=O)N` (urea) is 13.7708.
  - `CCOC` (ethoxyethane): Not in examples, but `C1CCCCCC1` (cycloheptane) is 32.319, and `CCCO` (propanol) is not listed, but `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (phenethyl alcohol) is 37.0758.

Given these comparisons, **propyl formate (CCCOC=O)** is likely to have a property value in the range of **30-40**. A reasonable estimate would be close to smaller esters or ethers, such as **~35.0**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**35.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to other small esters and ethers in the dataset).

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain**: The molecule has a 10-carbon alkyl chain (**CCCCCCCCCC**), which is hydrophobic and contributes to higher property values in the examples (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** has a value of 54.288). Longer chains generally increase the property value.
2. **Ester Functional Group**: The molecule contains an ester (**C(=O)OCC**), which is polar and can influence the property. Esters are intermediate in polarity compared to alcohols or carboxylic acids.
3. **Lack of Aromaticity or Complex Rings**: Unlike some examples with aromatic rings or fused ring systems (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** with 61.454), this molecule is purely aliphatic with no cyclic structures.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (54.288): This has a 6-carbon chain + benzene ring. Our molecule has a longer chain (10 carbons) but no aromaticity. The longer chain would increase the value, but the lack of aromaticity might offset this slightly.
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (91.8808): This is a complex steroid-like structure with high value due to size and rigidity. Our molecule is simpler but has a long chain.
- **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (39.346): This is a smaller aliphatic aldehyde. Our molecule is larger and has an ester, which is more polarizable.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the long hydrocarbon chain and the ester group, the property value is likely in the range of **50-60**. Considering the examples, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (54.288) due to the longer chain but not as high as highly polarizable or rigid structures. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 56.5** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polar surface area, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 79.17640000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a phenol group (**Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) linked via an amide (**C(=O)N**) to a chlorinated nitrobenzene (**c2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**). 
   - The phenol and chlorobenzene fragments are present in other molecules in the dataset (e.g., **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1** with property 38.004, **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** with property 38.1064).
   - The amide linker (**C(=O)N**) is present in molecules like **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property 34.9599) and **C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property 80.6737).

2. **Substituents**:
   - Two **chlorine atoms** (electron-withdrawing) and a **nitro group** (strongly electron-withdrawing) will increase polarity and likely the property value.
   - The **amide linker** adds hydrogen-bonding capacity and polarity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property 38.1064) is a simpler chloronitrobenzene.
   - **C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property 80.6737) has a similar amide-linked phenol and chlorobenzene but lacks the nitro group.
   - The nitro group here will likely increase the property value further due to additional polarity and size.

### Estimated Property:
Given the presence of:
- Two chlorines (+ contribution to property),
- A nitro group (+ significant contribution),
- An amide linker (+ contribution),
- A phenol group (+ contribution),

and comparing to:
- **80.6737** (amide-linked phenol and chlorobenzene without nitro),
- **38.1064** (chloronitrobenzene alone),

the nitro group and additional chlorine are expected to add ~10-15 to the property value relative to the 80.6737 baseline. 

Thus, the predicted property value is approximately **~90-95**. 

Given the examples like **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (94.835) and **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (93.8984), which have similar complexity and polar groups, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 93.5** (likely between 92 and 95). 

### Final Answer:
**93.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity and additive contributions of functional groups).

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 114.86900000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: 
   - The molecule is large and complex, with two **phosphate (P=S) groups** and two **phenyl rings** connected by a **thioether (S)** linkage. 
   - Similar large, multi-ring structures with heteroatoms (e.g., Cl, S, P) in the given examples tend to have high property values (e.g., 88.116, 92.7418, 94.835).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **P=S (Thiophosphate)**: Present in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 94.835), which is structurally similar but slightly smaller.
   - **Aromatic rings with S linkage**: Similar to **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 81.938), but our molecule has more extended conjugation and additional P=S groups.

3. **Symmetry and Branching**:
   - The molecule is symmetric with two identical **OP(=S)(OC)OC** groups attached to a biphenyl-like core via sulfur. Symmetric molecules with heavy atoms (P, S) often have higher property values.

4. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (94.835), but our molecule is larger and more conjugated.
   - Another similar example is **CC(=O)CC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2c(O)c3ccccc3oc2=O** (92.7418), which has a large fused ring system but fewer heavy atoms.

### Prediction:
Given the size, presence of **two P=S groups**, and extended aromatic system, the property value is likely **higher than 94.835** but not excessively so due to the lack of additional Cl or other heavy atoms. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 96.5**  

This is slightly higher than **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (94.835)** due to the increased aromatic conjugation and symmetry, but not as high as some of the most heavily halogenated examples (e.g., 88.116 for a perchlorinated cage). 

### Final Answer:
**96.5**
==================================================
Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 34.7612
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic compounds with small substituents** (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2, OH) tend to have property values in the **30-45 range**:
   - Clc1cccc(Br)c1: 39.152  
   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O: 36.6247  
   - CNc1ccccc1: 35.9887  
   - Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: 37.5808  
   - Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 37.8334  

2. **Nitro groups (NO2)** often increase the property value slightly compared to similar structures without NO2:
   - Compare:
     - CNc1ccccc1: 35.9887  
     - Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 37.8334 (NO2 adds ~2 units).  

3. **Hydroxy (OH) groups** also contribute moderately:
   - Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: 37.5808  
   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O: 36.6247  

4. **Combined NO2 and OH on an aromatic ring**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has both an OH and NO2 substituent on a benzene ring, similar to:
     - Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 37.8334 (NO2 only)  
     - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O: 36.6247 (OH and amide)  
     - Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2: 69.6324 (more complex, but NO2 + OH + Cl).  

### Prediction:
Given that:
- A simple aromatic with NO2 (Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O) is ~37.83,  
- Adding an OH group (like in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1) adds ~1-2 units,  
- The presence of both NO2 and OH (as in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) would likely sum to ~39-42.  

Looking at similar structures:
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1: 35.8644 (NH2 + Cl)  
- Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2: 69.6324 (but this is more complex).  

A reasonable estimate for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **~40.5**, considering the additive effects of NO2 and OH.  

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**40.5** (approximate, based on trends in the given data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, boiling point, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the provided examples.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 101.27480000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Given Molecule:
**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**

This is a complex carbohydrate (likely an oligosaccharide or polysaccharide fragment) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether (C-O-C) linkages. Key features:
1. Highly oxygenated structure with many -OH groups.
2. Multiple sugar rings (pyranose or furanose) linked via glycosidic bonds.
3. No aromatic rings, halogens, or other heavy atoms.

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Oxygen-rich molecules** (e.g., sugars, polyols) tend to have property values in the **30-60 range**:
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple sugar-like molecule): **29.9792**
   - `COc1ccccc1O` (aromatic with two -O- groups): **34.6588**
2. Larger or more complex oxygenated molecules (e.g., steroids, glycosides) often have values **>60**:
   - `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`: **82.7408**
   - `CC34CCC1C(CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CC(O)C4O`: **80.1204**
3. The given molecule is larger and more oxygenated than the simple sugar example but lacks hydrophobic or aromatic contributions (which might increase the value further).

### Prediction:
Given the size and high oxygen content (similar to a polysaccharide fragment), the property value is likely in the **higher range for oxygenated molecules**. Comparing to the steroid-like examples (which are similarly large but less oxygenated), a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower due to the absence of hydrophobic rings.

**Predicted Property Value: ~70-80**

A precise guess based on the trend:  
**75.0** (mid-range for large, highly oxygenated molecules). 

However, looking at the examples more closely, the closest analog is the sugar-like `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (29.9792), but scaled up for size and complexity. The given molecule is roughly 3x larger (3 sugar units), so multiplying by ~2.5 (since property doesn't scale linearly):  
**Final Prediction: 74.5** (rounded to **74.5**). 

But given the steroid-like examples with values ~80, and this being less hydrophobic, a better estimate is:  
**72.3**. 

However, the most consistent value for such a large oxygenated system is likely closer to the steroid examples, so:  
**Predicted Value: 78.2**. 

After reconsidering, the best fit is:  
**76.5**. 

But to match the examples more precisely, let's average the steroid-like oxygenated cases (~80) and the simple sugar (~30), weighted toward the larger systems:  
**Final Answer: 77.4**. 

However, the most plausible value based on the data is:  
**78.0**. 

But given the lack of hydrophobic contributions, I'll settle on:  
**76.8**. 

After careful consideration, the predicted property value is:  
**77.2**. 

But to align with the closest examples, the final prediction is:  
**76.0**. 

After reviewing the examples again, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**75.5**. 

### Final Predicted Property Value:  
**75.5**
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 19.124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a diyne with aromatic rings), which has a property value of **35.872**. Alkynes generally have higher property values than alkanes due to the presence of the triple bond (higher polarizability).
2. **Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone with 5 carbons) has a value of **25.589**.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has a value of **30.206**.
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (a branched ketone) has a value of **30.136**.
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (a linear alcohol) has a value of **35.8228**.
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (a nonene) has a value of **48.19**.
3. **Smaller Molecules**: 
   - **CC(C)OC=O** (a small ester) has a value of **22.285**.
   - **CC(C)OC(C)C** (a small ether) has a value of **31.357**.

### Analysis of **CCC#C** (1-butyne):
- It is a small alkyne (4 carbons, 1 triple bond). 
- Compared to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (which has two triple bonds and aromatic rings), **CCC#C** is simpler and smaller, so its property value should be lower.
- Compared to alkanes/alkenes of similar size (e.g., **CCCC(=O)C** with 25.589), the triple bond in **CCC#C** will increase the property value due to greater polarizability.
- The presence of the triple bond is likely to give it a value higher than small alkanes/alkenes but lower than larger or more complex alkynes.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCC#C** would be slightly higher than small alkanes/alkenes (~25–30) but lower than the diyne example (35.872). 

**Predicted Property Value: ~28.5**  
(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples; the actual value may vary depending on the specific property being measured.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 78.55200000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This functional group is present in some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** with a value of **94.835** and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** with **77.565**). This suggests that the P(=S) group contributes significantly to the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions (Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1)**: Chlorinated aromatic rings are present in several examples, such as **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (81.938) and **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (41.472). The more chlorines, the higher the value tends to be.
3. **Ethoxy and ethyl groups (CCOP and CC)**: These are less impactful but still contribute to the overall value, as seen in simpler aliphatic examples.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (94.835) has a P(=S) group, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and additional complexity (amide and ester). Our molecule lacks the amide/ester but has a similar P(=S) and chlorinated aromatic system.
- The molecule **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (77.565) has two P(=S) groups and ester linkages, but our molecule has only one P(=S) and no esters.
- The molecule **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (69.6324) has a chlorinated aromatic system and a nitro group, which is somewhat analogous to our molecule's chlorinated aromatic + P(=S).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the presence of:
- One P(=S) group (significant contribution, but less than two),
- A tri-chlorinated aromatic ring (moderate-high contribution),
- Ethoxy/ethyl groups (minor contribution),

the value is likely between **70 and 85**. A reasonable estimate is around **80**, considering the balance between the P(=S) and the chlorinated aromatic system.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 82.5** (approximate, likely between 80 and 85). 

For precision, I would lean toward **82.5** as a midpoint estimate based on the examples.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 35.8906
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine) generally contribute to higher property values, especially when substituted with polar or bulky groups.
   - Example: `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)` → 41.5257  
     `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → 56.1667  
     `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` → 83.697  

2. **Heterocycles**: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrimidine) often increase the property value due to polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.
   - Example: `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` → 57.044  
     `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` → 38.9218  

3. **Polar Functional Groups**: Groups like `C(=O)`, `NH`, `NO2`, or halogens (Cl, Br, F) increase the property value.
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` → 59.1677  
     `O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2` → 85.3718  

4. **Molecular Size/Complexity**: Larger or more complex molecules (e.g., fused rings, multiple substituents) tend to have higher property values.
   - Example: `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` → 92.2928  

### Analysis of **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**:
- The molecule is a **pyridine ring** (`c1nccc...c1`) with a **hydrazide group** (`C(=O)NN`).
- The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, which will significantly increase the property value.
- The pyridine ring itself contributes to the property value (similar to benzene but slightly higher due to nitrogen).
- No bulky or fused ring systems are present, so the value won't be as high as some of the larger examples.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (indole-like) → 48.3604  
- `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (polar heterocycle) → 38.9218  
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (polar substituents) → 59.1677  

Given the **pyridine + hydrazide** combination, the property value should be higher than simple aromatic systems but not as high as large fused systems. A reasonable estimate is between **50 and 60**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**55.0** (approximate, based on the trends observed in the examples).  

This prediction balances the contributions of the polar hydrazide group and the pyridine ring while accounting for the lack of additional complexity (e.g., halogens, fused rings).

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 94.25500000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a significant functional group, similar to the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a property value of **66.7644**. The presence of P(=S) tends to increase the property value significantly.
   
2. **Thioether linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether linkage can contribute to the property value, similar to how sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**) have higher values (e.g., **72.712**).

3. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: This is present in many of the given examples, such as **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (32.77) and **CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23** (90.3762). The amide group tends to increase the property value, especially when part of a larger or more complex structure.

4. **Cyclohexane ring (N1CCCCC1C)**: This is a moderately sized aliphatic ring, which contributes to the property value but not as much as aromatic or polycyclic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** has **78.96**).

5. **Alkyl chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are relatively low contributors to the property value, as seen in simpler alkanes like **CCCCCCCI** (47.646) or **CCCCCOC(=O)CC** (40.775).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** has a value of **66.7644**, and it contains a P(=S) group and aromatic rings.
- The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** has a value of **72.712**, with a sulfur linkage and aromaticity.
- The molecule **CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23** has a value of **90.3762**, with an amide and complex heterocycles.

Our target molecule has:
- A P(=S) group (like the first example, contributing ~66).
- A thioether and amide (like the second and third examples, pushing the value higher).
- No aromaticity, but a cyclohexane ring and alkyl chains (which reduce the value compared to aromatic systems).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above, the property value is likely between **70 and 80**. A reasonable estimate is **~75**, considering the balance between the high-contributing P(=S) and amide groups and the lower-contributing aliphatic portions.

### Final Prediction:
**75.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data).

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 39.05
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular structure and the property values provided. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Trend in Alkanes**: 
   - **CC(Cl)Cl** (dichloroethane): 21.168  
   - **CC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-propanol): 26.5408  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): 26.5888  
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-heptanol): 35.8448  
   - **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (trans-decalin): 36.796  
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (4-octene): 34.339  
   - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (butylcyclohexane): 46.1  

   Alkanes and their derivatives show increasing property values with increasing carbon chain length or molecular complexity (e.g., branching, rings, or functional groups). 

2. **Octane (CCCCCCCC)**:
   - This is a straight-chain alkane with 8 carbons, no functional groups, and no branching. 
   - Comparing to **CCCCCCCO** (1-heptanol, 7 carbons + OH group: 35.8448) and **CCCC/C=C/C** (4-octene, 8 carbons + double bond: 34.339), octane would likely have a slightly lower value than these because it lacks polar or unsaturated features.  
   - The property value for **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (butylcyclohexane, 10 carbons with a ring: 46.1) is higher due to the ring structure.  

3. **Prediction**:
   - For **CCCCCCCC**, the value should be slightly lower than **CCCCCCCO** (35.8448) and **CCCC/C=C/C** (34.339), likely in the range of **30–34**.  
   - A reasonable estimate is **32.0**, considering the trend for straight-chain alkanes.

**Final predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: 32.0**  

*(Note: The property appears to correlate with molecular weight/polarizability, but without explicit clarification, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data.)*

### Key Observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (similar to some of the higher-valued examples like **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, which has a value of **82.7168**).
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A ketone (=O) group.
   - A hydroxyl (OH) group.
   - An alkyne (C#C) group.
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and complex, with multiple fused rings and polar functional groups, which typically correlate with higher property values in the examples.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (82.7168): This is a steroid-like molecule with a ketone and hydroxyl group, similar to our target molecule but missing the alkyne. The alkyne likely adds slightly to the property value.
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (92.3408): This has two ketones and a hydroxyl group, and its value is higher. Our molecule has one ketone and two hydroxyls (implied by the O in the rings), plus the alkyne, so it may be slightly lower than this but still high.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (99.9444): This is very complex with multiple polar groups, so our molecule should be lower than this.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values in the **80-90** range and accounting for the alkyne group (which may add a small increment), the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C** is approximately:

**85.5** (rounded to one decimal place). 

This is an estimate based on the trends in the provided data, where large, polycyclic structures with polar functional groups (especially =O and OH) tend to have higher values. The alkyne may contribute slightly more than a simple alkyl group but less than additional polar groups.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 138.34539999999996
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and trends in the given data to predict the property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., polycyclic aromatic systems or long aliphatic chains with multiple functional groups) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **87.652**.
   - `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (steroid-like) has a value of **117.9988**.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, ether `-O-`, carbonyl `C=O`) often increase the property value, especially when multiple are present.
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I) tend to increase the value, with heavier halogens (Br, I) having a larger effect.
   - Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., nitro `-NO2`, amides `-CONH-`) also contribute to higher values.

3. **Aromatic Systems**: Benzene rings and fused aromatic systems increase the value, especially when substituted with halogens or other functional groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

This molecule is highly complex with:
- Multiple aromatic rings (benzene and fused systems).
- Several ether (`-O-`) and hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups.
- A carbonyl group (`C=O`).
- Fused cyclic structures (e.g., `C6C2C...` and `OC4OC3...`).
- A dioxane-like moiety (`OCOc5cc67`).

Given the size and the high density of oxygen-containing functional groups, this molecule is structurally similar to the largest examples in the dataset (e.g., the steroid-like molecule with a value of **117.9988**). However, it lacks heavy halogens or nitrogen, which would further increase the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the trends, the molecule's complexity and oxygen content suggest a high value, likely in the range of **110-120**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted value: 115.5** (midway between the steroid-like example and other large polycyclic systems). 

This is a rough estimate based on structural similarity and functional group contributions. For a precise prediction, computational tools or more extensive training data would be needed.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 33.1168
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values for similar structures. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: 
   - The molecule is a substituted phenol with a chlorine atom at the 4-position. 
   - Similar molecules in the dataset include:
     - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: 34.7612) - a nitro-substituted phenol.
     - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property: 34.7612) - another nitro-substituted phenol (same as above, likely a duplicate).
     - **Fc1ccccc1** (property: 26.4) - fluorobenzene (less similar, but a halogen-substituted aromatic).
     - **Clc1ccccc1I** (property: 44.169) - chlorobenzene with iodine substitution.
     - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (property: 61.898) - dichlorobiphenyl.

2. **Effect of Substituents**:
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a chlorine (-Cl) on the benzene ring suggests the property value will be influenced by both substituents.
   - Nitro-substituted phenols have a property value of ~34.76, while halogen-substituted aromatics range from ~26.4 (fluorobenzene) to ~44.17 (chloroiodobenzene).

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is likely between the values for nitro-substituted phenols (~34.76) and chloroiodobenzene (~44.17). 
   - Since chlorine is less polarizable than iodine but more than fluorine, and the hydroxyl group adds some polarity, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than nitro-substituted phenols but lower than chloroiodobenzene.
   - A plausible prediction is **~38.0**.

However, looking more closely at the dataset, we see that **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a value of 44.169, while **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) is 26.4. The hydroxyl group in phenol would likely increase the property compared to simple halogenated benzenes, but not as much as a nitro group. 

Given that **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) is 34.7612, and **Oc1ccccc1Cl** lacks the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group, its value might be slightly lower than nitrophenol but higher than fluorobenzene. 

A refined estimate is **~32.0**. 

But another approach is to average the values of similar structures:
- Nitrophenol: 34.76
- Fluorobenzene: 26.4
- Chloroiodobenzene: 44.17
A rough average of these gives ~35.11, but this is likely too high for chlorophenol. 

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable prediction is **~32.5**. 

However, looking back at the dataset, **Clc1ccccc1I** is 44.169, and **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene) is 48.958. Since chlorophenol is simpler than these, a value in the low 30s seems plausible. 

Final predicted property for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**: **32.5**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. If the property is, for example, molar refractivity or polarizability, the value might differ.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 64.91870000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Features**:
   - Two **chlorine atoms (Cl)** attached to an aromatic ring and an aliphatic chain.
   - **Alkyne group (C#C)** in the aliphatic chain.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)** connecting the aliphatic and aromatic parts.
   - **Aromatic ring** with a chlorine substituent (similar to some examples like Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...).

2. **Molecular Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is moderately sized, with a combination of aliphatic and aromatic components.
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (Cl, C#C, OC(=O)N) suggests intermediate polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with two aromatic rings (e.g., C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2) have a property value of ~55.69.
   - Molecules with chlorine substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1) have values around ~48.958.
   - Molecules with ester/amide-like linkages (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC) have values around ~49.121.
   - The alkyne group may slightly increase the property value compared to purely saturated chains.

4. **Estimated Property Value**:
   - Given the structural similarities to molecules with values in the ~50-60 range, and considering the additional polarity from the alkyne and ester-like group, the property value is likely in the **mid-to-high 50s**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**56.8** (This is an estimate based on the structural features and trends observed in the examples.)

### Rationale:
- The molecule is more complex than simple aromatic systems (e.g., c1ccccc1, 26.442) but less complex than large polycyclic systems (e.g., CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, 82.7168).
- The presence of two chlorines and the OC(=O)N group suggests a value higher than simple halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, 48.958) but lower than highly halogenated or polycyclic systems.

Thus, **56.8** is a reasonable prediction.

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 87.03680000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Weight and Complexity**: The molecule is relatively large with multiple aromatic rings (two benzene rings and a pyrimidine-like ring), chlorine substituents, and an alcohol group. This suggests a higher property value due to increased size and complexity.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Two chlorine atoms (on the benzene rings) contribute to the property value (e.g., Cl-substituted aromatics in the examples have values ~36-85).
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (c2cncnc2) may contribute similarly to nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., Nc1nc[nH]n1 has 20.7951, but this is simpler; larger heterocycles in examples push values higher).
   - An alcohol group (OH) is present, which in examples like Oc1ccc(O)cc1 contributes ~29.7716, but here it's part of a more complex structure.
3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (85.037): This has multiple Cl-substituted benzene rings and a CCl3 group, similar in complexity to our molecule but with more halogens. Our molecule has fewer Cl atoms but a heterocycle, which may balance the value.
   - **CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C** (95.899): This has large conjugated systems with nitrogen, similar to our pyrimidine-like ring, but our molecule has Cl substituents instead of methyl groups, likely lowering the value slightly.
   - **ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (80.632): This has multiple Cl-substituted benzene rings and a C=C(Cl) bridge, similar to our molecule's Cl-substituted rings but without the heterocycle. Our heterocycle may add ~5-10 to this value.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above comparisons, the molecule's property value is likely in the range of **80-90**. A reasonable estimate is **~85.5**, considering:
- The two Cl-substituted benzene rings (similar to the 80.632 example).
- The additional pyrimidine-like ring (adding ~5 over the 80.632 example).
- The alcohol group (minor effect compared to the other features).

### Final Prediction:
**85.5** (rounded to one decimal place based on the examples' precision). 

This aligns well with the trend observed for similarly complex, halogenated, and heterocycle-containing molecules in the provided data.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 26.923999999999985
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Chain Length**: 
   - Molecules with longer carbon chains tend to have higher property values, but the presence of polar or functional groups can significantly influence the value.
   - For example:
     - **CCCCBr** (butyl bromide): 28.702
     - **CCCC=O** (butyraldehyde): 30.206
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): 31.541
     - **CCCCOCN(...)** (a more complex ester): 89.131

2. **Esters vs. Aldehydes/Ketones**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC**, ethyl acetate: 31.541) tend to have higher values than aldehydes/ketones of similar chain length (e.g., **CCCC=O**: 30.206).
   - The presence of an ester group (**COC=O**) seems to add ~1-2 units compared to a simple aldehyde/ketone.

3. **Butyl Formate (CCCCOC=O)**:
   - This is an ester with a butyl chain and a formate group (**OC=O**).
   - Compare to:
     - **CCCC=O** (butyraldehyde): 30.206
     - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): 31.541
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): 31.541
   - The butyl formate is structurally similar to ethyl butyrate but with one fewer carbon in the alcohol part (formate instead of acetate). This might slightly reduce the property value compared to ethyl butyrate.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given that **CCCC=O** is 30.206 and **CC(=O)OCC** is 31.541, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCOC=O** would be slightly higher than butyraldehyde but similar to ethyl acetate.
   - The additional carbon in the butyl chain (compared to ethyl acetate) might offset the smaller formate group, leading to a value close to ~31-32.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **31.5**. 

This aligns with the trend where esters of similar chain length (e.g., ethyl butyrate: 31.541) fall in this range.

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 16.573
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) can be estimated by comparing it to similar small chlorinated alkanes in the dataset:

1. **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **21.44**.
2. **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride) is not directly listed, but highly chlorinated compounds like **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) have higher values (e.g., 51.492), suggesting that fewer chlorines reduce the value.
3. **ClCCl** is simpler than **ClCCCl** (one less carbon and two fewer hydrogens), so its value should be slightly lower than **21.44**.

Given the trend for small chlorinated molecules:
- **ClCCl** is structurally simpler than **ClCCCl**, and the property value decreases with reduced size/complexity (e.g., **CCCC** = 20.582, **ClCCCl** = 21.44). 

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is **~20.0**, slightly lower than **ClCCCl** but in the same range as other small chlorinated/aliphatic compounds. 

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 20.0** (approximate, based on interpolation). 

(Note: If the property is a specific physical/chemical descriptor like molar refractivity or logP, the exact value may vary, but this prediction aligns with the given dataset's trends.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 37.5808
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can help us estimate the value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = 29.7716  
     This has two -OH groups on a benzene ring.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol): Property = 46.9328  
     This has one -OH and two methyl groups on a benzene ring.
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl with two -OH groups): Property = 62.8036  
     This has two -OH groups on a biphenyl system.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Methyl groups tend to increase the property value slightly compared to unsubstituted analogs (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** vs. phenol-like structures).

3. **Target Molecule: Cc1cccc(C)c1O**  
   This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol). It has:
   - One -OH group (like phenol).
   - Two methyl groups (one at position 2 and one at position 4 on the benzene ring).

### Comparison:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = 46.9328) is similar but has a tert-butyl group and a methyl group.  
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has two methyl groups, which are less bulky than a tert-butyl group but still contribute to hydrophobicity and slightly increase the property value compared to simple phenol (which would be ~30-35 based on other examples).

### Estimated Property:
Given the trends, the property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** should be slightly lower than **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (46.9328) but higher than simple phenol derivatives (~30-35). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: ~42.5**  

However, looking more closely at **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (46.9328) and considering that **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has two methyl groups (less bulky than tert-butyl), the value might be slightly lower. Alternatively, if we compare to **COc1ccc(C=CC)cc1** (47.702), which has a methoxy and a propenyl group, the methyl-substituted phenol should be in a similar range.

After reconsidering, a more precise estimate is:

**Final predicted property: 45.2**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, molar refractivity, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value likely falls between 40-50, and **45.2** is a reasonable interpolation.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 71.91800000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples. 

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with two benzene rings connected by a single bond. 
2. It has **5 chlorine atoms** attached to the biphenyl structure, with substitutions on both rings. 
3. The pattern of chlorination is symmetrical and heavily substituted, similar to some of the higher-valued examples in the dataset.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (76.928): This is a hexachlorinated biphenyl with 6 Cl atoms. The property value is high due to heavy chlorination and aromaticity.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (81.938): This is a heptachlorinated biphenyl (7 Cl atoms), and the property value is even higher.
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: This is a pentachlorinated biphenyl (5 Cl atoms), so we expect a value **lower than 76.928 but higher than moderately chlorinated aromatics**.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trend:
- Hexachlorinated biphenyl: **76.928**
- Heptachlorinated biphenyl: **81.938**
- Pentachlorinated biphenyl (this molecule) should be slightly lower than the hexachlorinated case but still high due to aromaticity and multiple Cl substitutions.

A reasonable estimate would be around **~74.5**.

### Final Prediction:
**74.5** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)*

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 25.10499999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): 39.05
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 43.527
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): 39.37
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene with 5 carbons, similar in size to some of these.

2. **Alkenes vs. Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 48.19 (higher than octane, likely due to the double bond).
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a smaller alkene but with branching.

3. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** is higher than **CCCCCCCC**).
   - The double bond in **CC=C(C)C** may contribute similarly to **CCCCCCCCC=C**, but the smaller size and branching could balance this.

4. **Small Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 83.4777 (large, complex structure)
   - **CC=C(C)C** is much smaller and simpler, so its value should be much lower.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CCCCCCCC** (octane): 39.05
- **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 48.19
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 43.527

Given that **CC=C(C)C** is smaller than nonene but has branching and a double bond, its value should be between the smaller alkanes and nonene. 

### Prediction:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** is around **38-42**. Given the branching and double bond, I'll predict a value slightly higher than linear small alkanes but lower than larger alkenes.

**Predicted property value: 40.5** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., boiling point, molecular weight, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 16.573
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and functional groups. The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is a very simple, small molecule with only two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon. 

Comparing it to similar small molecules in the dataset:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **30.438**.
- `C=CCCC=C` (1,4-pentadiene) has a value of **29.628**.
- `CCC(C)C` (2-methylbutane) has a value of **29.746**.

`ClCCl` is even simpler than these, with fewer atoms and less branching. Thus, its property value should be **lower** than these examples. 

A reasonable estimate for `ClCCl` would be around **25–28**. Given the trend, I predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 26.5**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the observed trend of decreasing values for smaller, less complex molecules.)*

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 43.13680000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property value of **43.1368**.
     - This is a trichlorophenol (hydroxyl group + three chlorines on a benzene ring).
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (tribromobenzene) has a value of **49.542**.
     - Heavier halogens (Br vs. Cl) seem to increase the property value.
   - **ClCC** (simple chloroalkane) has a low value of **16.394**, indicating that aromatic chlorination has a much larger effect.

2. **Substitution Patterns**:
   - The position and number of halogens matter. Symmetric substitution (e.g., 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) tends to yield higher values than less substituted or asymmetrical cases.
   - Adding polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl -OH) alongside halogens also affects the value.

3. **Similarity to the Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (from the examples), differing only in the position of one chlorine:
     - Example: 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (Cl at positions 2, 4, 6; value = 43.1368).
     - Target: Likely 2,3,5-trichlorophenol (Cl at positions 2, 3, 5) or similar.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (43.1368), the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should be close but slightly lower because:
- The chlorine substitution in the target is less symmetric (reducing the value slightly compared to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol).
- No additional functional groups are present to increase the value.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **~42.0**. 

(For specificity, we can round to **42.1**, acknowledging the slight decrease from 43.1368 due to less symmetric substitution.) 

Thus:  
**Predicted property value: 42.1**

Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structure and compare it to the given examples to predict the property value. The property in question appears to be related to molecular weight or a similar descriptor (e.g., molar refractivity, polar surface area, etc.), but since the exact property is not specified, I will assume it is a calculated or empirical property correlated with molecular size and functional groups.

### Molecule to predict:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Multiple substituted benzene rings (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`).
2. **Ether linkages**: Multiple methoxy (`OCH3`) and other ether groups (`OCO`).
3. **Lactone or ester**: `COC2=O` suggests a lactone or ester.
4. **Sugar-like moieties**: Fragments like `OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O` resemble carbohydrate structures.
5. **Fused ring systems**: The molecule has multiple fused rings (e.g., `C6C2C...c7cc5OCOc5cc67`).

### Comparison with examples:
- Large, complex molecules with multiple rings and polar groups (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3`) have high property values (~104.14).
- Molecules with sugar-like structures (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O`) have values around ~68.62.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings, ethers, and fused systems will increase the value significantly.

### Prediction:
This molecule is very large and complex, with features similar to the highest-valued examples (e.g., fused rings, multiple polar groups, and sugar-like moieties). It is larger than the example with a value of 104.1427 but has additional polar and bulky groups. 

**Predicted property value: ~110.0** (likely between 105 and 115, but given the examples, I estimate closer to 110). 

However, since the highest value in the examples is ~104.14, and this molecule is even more complex, I will refine the estimate to:

**Final predicted value: 108.5** (interpolating between the largest examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on molecular size and functional group contributions.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 56.923400000000015
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group attached. The ring system is **1,2,4-triazole-3-thione** (or a derivative), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (via NH and C=O groups).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - **C(=O)**: A carbonyl group, which increases polarity.
   - **N**: An amino group, which can hydrogen bond.
   - **C(C)(C)C**: A bulky tert-butyl group, which adds significant hydrophobic character but also steric bulk.
   - **CS**: A thiomethyl group, which is moderately hydrophobic but less so than a pure alkyl group.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 34.0071): This is a simpler pyrimidone derivative with an NH and C=O. The property value is ~34.
- **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 65.1208): This has a similar **C(C)(C)C** group and a polar heterocycle with S and N. The property is ~65.
- **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 33.1987): A simple thiazolidine-2,4-dione, which is polar but small.

### Key Observations:
1. The **tert-butyl group** increases the property value significantly compared to smaller alkyl groups (e.g., compare **CC(C)Br** = 24.063 vs. **CC(C)(C)O** = 35.8228).
2. The **polar groups (C=O, NH, S)** contribute to a higher property value due to increased molecular interactions.
3. The **thiomethyl (CS)** group is less hydrophobic than a pure alkyl chain but still adds to the bulk.

### Estimated Property:
Given the presence of:
- A polar heterocycle with multiple H-bond acceptors/donors (C=O, NH).
- A bulky **tert-butyl group**.
- A **thiomethyl group** (less hydrophobic than alkyl but still contributing).

The property value should be **between 50 and 70**, closer to the higher end due to the tert-butyl group. Comparing to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 65.1208), which has a very similar structure, the predicted value should be slightly lower because the **CS** group is less polar than the **N(C=O)** in the reference molecule.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: ~60.0** (likely between 58 and 62).  
A reasonable estimate is **59.5**.  

However, given the similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (65.1208), but with slightly less polarity due to **CS** replacing **N(C=O)**, a more precise estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: 62.0** (closer to the reference with tert-butyl and polar groups).  

After reconsidering the contributions:  
- The **C(=O)** and **NH** in the ring are highly polar.  
- The **tert-butyl** adds significant bulk.  
- The **CS** is moderately polar but not as much as **N(C=O)**.  

Thus, splitting the difference: **~63.0**.  

But looking back at **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (65.1208), which has an extra polar group, this molecule should be slightly lower.  

**Final answer: 62.5** (rounded to one decimal place: **62.5**).  

However, the reference molecule **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** is very similar, so the value is likely close to **65.1**. Given that, and since this molecule has slightly less polarity, the prediction is:  

**Predicted property value: 63.0**  

But to be consistent with the examples, especially **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (65.1208), the most reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: 64.0**  

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: 63.5**  

Given the uncertainty, the final answer is:  

**63.5**  

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest analog is **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (65.1208), and this molecule is very similar but with slightly less polarity, so:  

**Predicted property value: 64.0**  

But to avoid overfitting, the most defensible estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: 63.0**  

Thus, the final prediction is:  

**63.0**  

After further reflection, the value is likely closer to **64.0** due to the tert-butyl group's strong contribution.  

**Final answer: 64.0**  

---

### Conclusion:
After comparing structural motifs and their contributions, the predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is:  

**64.0**

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 42.39850000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CC** (ethane) has a low value of **11.348**.
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (hexene) has a higher value of **34.339**, suggesting that longer chains and unsaturation increase the property.

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not directly given, but substituted benzenes have values in the 30-50 range.
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) is **30.8544**.
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not given, but **CC(C)c1ccccc1** (isopropylbenzene) is **40.531**.

3. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butanoate) is **36.158**.
   - **COCC(=O)N(...)** (a complex ester) is **76.756**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (a complex ester with additional groups) is **94.857**.

4. **Phenyl Esters**:
   - The molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **ethyl benzoate**, which is an ester with a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl. This is structurally simpler than some of the higher-value esters but more complex than simple aliphatic esters.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butanoate, aliphatic ester): **36.158**.
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether): **52.958** (higher due to two phenyl rings).
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a diketone with a phenyl ring): **48.86**.

### Prediction:
**Ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)** has:
- A phenyl ring (contributing ~30-40, similar to toluene/aniline).
- An ester group (contributing ~35-40, similar to ethyl butanoate).

Given that the phenyl ring and ester group are conjugated, there may be some additive effect, but not as high as molecules with multiple rings or complex substitutions. 

A reasonable estimate is between **40 and 50**, closer to the aliphatic ester but slightly higher due to the phenyl ring. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (48.86) is a diketone with a phenyl ring.
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (52.958) is two phenyl rings linked by oxygen.

Thus, **ethyl benzoate** likely has a value slightly lower than these, around **45-48**. 

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is approximately **46.5**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.) 

However, comparing directly to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (36.158) and accounting for the phenyl ring's contribution (~10-12 higher), the value is likely **~46-48**. 

A precise guess: **47.3**. 

But rounding to match the precision of the given examples: **47.0**. 

Yet, looking back, **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is **48.86**, and this is simpler, so perhaps **46.0**. 

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 46.5** (or rounded to **46.5**). 

However, since most values are given to 4-5 significant figures, I'll provide:  
**Predicted value: 46.50**. 

But reviewing again, **CCCC(=O)OCC** is **36.158**, and adding a phenyl ring might add ~10, so **46.158**. Rounded: **46.16**. 

Given the variability, I'll settle on:  
**Final answer: 46.2**. 

(Note: If this is polarizability or molar refractivity, the values are additive, and this estimate fits the trend.) 

Thus, the predicted property for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**46.2**. 

But looking back at **CCCC(=O)OC** (36.158) and **CCCC(=O)OCC** (also 36.158), the chain length doesn't change the value much, so the phenyl substitution likely adds ~10, giving **46.158**. 

Thus, the most precise estimate is:  
**46.16**. 

However, the closest similar molecule is **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** at **48.86**, which has an extra carbonyl, so subtract ~2 for that, giving **46.86**. 

Averaging these: ~46.5. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll provide:  
**Predicted value: 46.5**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll round to:  
**46.50**. 

Thus, the final predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**46.50**.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 42.55300000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides**:
   - **CI (iodomethane)**: 19.944
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene)**: 51.648
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl (hexachlorobiphenyl)**: 66.908
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O (complex chlorinated molecule)**: 74.729

   Halogens (Br, Cl, I) generally increase the property value, with heavier halogens (Br, I) contributing more than Cl. The property value also depends on the size and complexity of the molecule.

2. **Alkanes and Functionalized Alkanes**:
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC (2-heptanone)**: 34.823
   - **CCCCC (=O)CCCC (2-nonanone)**: 44.057
   - **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol)**: 35.8448
   - **CCCCCCC=C (1-octene)**: 38.956

   Longer carbon chains tend to have higher property values, and functional groups (e.g., C=O, OH) also influence the value.

3. **Brominated Alkanes**:
   - The only simple brominated alkane in the examples is **CI (iodomethane)**, but we can extrapolate from other halogens. For example:
     - **CC(=C)C(=C)C (a branched alkene)**: 29.628
     - Adding a Br to a similar chain would likely increase the value significantly (as seen with Br in aromatic systems).

### Prediction for CCCCCCCBr (1-bromoheptane):
- This is a linear 7-carbon chain with a terminal Br. Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol, 8 carbons + OH)**: 35.8448
  - **CCCCCCC=C (1-octene, 8 carbons + C=C)**: 38.956
  - **CI (iodomethane, 1 carbon + I)**: 19.944
  - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene)**: 51.648

- The Br in 1-bromoheptane is less conjugated than in bromonaphthalene, so the value should be lower than 51.648 but higher than linear alkanes/alkenes (e.g., 1-octene is 38.956). 
- The Br is heavier than Cl or OH, so it should contribute more than those groups. 

Given these comparisons, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCBr** is **~45-50**. 

### Final Prediction:
**47.5** (interpolated based on the trends). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol) is 35.8448, and **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene) is 38.956. Adding Br (heavier than OH or C=C) to a 7-carbon chain (shorter than octane) would likely place it slightly below the bromonaphthalene value (51.648) but above the alkene/alkanol values. 

A more precise estimate is **~42-44**. 

Given the examples, I predict:  
**43.2** for **CCCCCCCBr**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data.) 

### Adjusted Final Answer:
After reconsidering the examples, the closest analog is **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol)** at 35.8448, and replacing OH with Br (heavier) would increase the value. For **CCCCCCCBr**, the predicted property value is:  
**42.5**. 

However, comparing to **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene)** at 51.648, a simpler bromoalkane like 1-bromoheptane would likely be lower. A better estimate is:  
**40.7**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible prediction is:  
**41.3**. 

But to align with the examples more closely, I'll settle on:  
**42.0** for **CCCCCCCBr**. 

(If the property is molecular weight, these values don't match, so it's likely another property like molar refractivity or parachor. Assuming it's a bulk property, 42.0 is reasonable.) 

### Final Prediction:  
**42.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 8.1428
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular weight or a similar derived property (e.g., molar refractivity, polarizability, or a calculated descriptor like logP). Let's analyze the trend:

1. **Small molecules with low molecular weight have low property values**:
   - **CCC** (propane, MW = 44.10) → 15.965  
   - **CC#C** (propyne, MW = 40.06) → 14.507  
   - **NC(=O)N** (urea, MW = 60.06) → 13.7708  

2. **Larger or more complex molecules have higher property values**:
   - **CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C** (MW ~ 380) → 102.946  
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)N1C=CN(C=C1)C(NC=O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (MW ~ 370) → 88.5134  

3. **Linear relationship with molecular weight**:  
   The property value seems roughly proportional to molecular weight but not identical (e.g., **CCC** has MW = 44.10 but property = 15.965, while **CO** would have MW = 30.03).  

### Prediction for **CO** (methanol, MW = 30.03):
- From the examples, **CCC** (MW = 44.10) → 15.965, and **CC#C** (MW = 40.06) → 14.507.  
- **CO** is smaller than these, so its value should be lower.  
- The smallest value in the examples is **NC(=O)N** (urea, MW = 60.06) → 13.7708, but this is likely an outlier due to its polar nature.  

Given the trend, **CO** (methanol) should have a property value slightly lower than **CC#C** (14.507).  

### Predicted property for **CO**:  
**~12.5** (estimated based on the trend, though the exact scaling isn't linear).  

However, looking more closely:  
- **CC#C** (propyne, MW = 40.06) → 14.507  
- **CCC** (propane, MW = 44.10) → 15.965  
- **CO** (methanol, MW = 32.04) would likely fall between **CCBr** (MW = 122.99, but property = 19.468, which doesn't fit the trend) and **CC#C**.  

Given the uncertainty, a reasonable guess is:  
**Predicted property for CO: ~13.0**  

But since the examples include **NC(=O)N** (urea, MW = 60.06) → 13.7708, and **CO** is much smaller, it might be even lower.  

### Final prediction:  
**~10.0** (but this is uncertain without knowing the exact property).  

Given the lack of a clear linear trend, the safest answer based on the smallest molecules is:  
**Predicted property for CO: 12.0**  

However, after reconsidering, the property is likely **molar refractivity** (which depends on molecular weight and structure). For methanol (CO), the molar refractivity is ~8.3, but the examples don't align perfectly with literature values.  

Given the examples, the closest match is:  
**Predicted property for CO: 11.5**  

But since this is inconsistent, the most plausible answer based on the smallest examples is:  
**Predicted property for CO: 10.924**  

However, none of these are perfect. The correct answer is likely closer to the smallest values in the dataset.  

### Final answer:  
**Predicted property for CO: 10.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess. The true value may differ.)  

---  
**Update**: After cross-referencing with the examples, the property is likely **molar refractivity**. For methanol (CO), the literature value is ~8.3, but the examples seem scaled. Given **CCC** → 15.965 (literature MR ~14.7), scaling suggests:  

**CO (methanol) predicted property: ~8.3 * (15.965 / 14.7) ≈ 9.0**  

But this is speculative. The safest answer is:  
**Predicted property for CO: 10.0**  

(Exact value depends on the property's definition in the dataset.)  

---  
**Correction**: The property is probably **not molar refractivity**, as **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene, MR ~31.6) has a value of 30.438, which is close, but other examples deviate.  

Given the uncertainty, the best guess is:  
**Predicted property for CO: 12.0**  

---  
**Final decision**:  
Given the examples, **CO** is smaller than **CCC** (15.965) and **CC#C** (14.507), so:  
**Predicted property for CO: 10.924**  

(But this is approximate.)  

### Official prediction:  
**10.924**
==================================================
