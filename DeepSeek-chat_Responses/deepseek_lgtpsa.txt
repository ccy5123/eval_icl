SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with certain functional groups and molecular structures. 

The molecule in question is: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Esters (RCOOR')** with long aliphatic chains tend to have property values around **-8.22430324** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the examples, which has this value).
2. Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CC=C`, `CCCCCC`, `CC(C)C`) have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain polar or functional groups that influence the property.
3. The presence of the ester group (`C(=O)OC`) combined with a long hydrocarbon chain (`CCCCCCCCC`) matches the examples like `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` and `CCOC(=O)CC`, which both have the value **-8.22430324**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is:

**-8.22430324**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3605312008270335
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with halogen (Cl, Br) substitutions, especially aromatic halides (e.g., Cl attached to benzene rings), often have a property value of 0.0. Examples:
     - `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (0.0)
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (0.0)
     - `BrC(Cl)Cl` (0.0)
     - `ClCCBr` (0.0)
   - Simple aliphatic halides (e.g., `ClC=C`, `ClCC`) also have 0.0.
   - Aromatic hydrocarbons without polar groups (e.g., `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`) also have 0.0.

2. **Property ≈ 0.78791796**:
   - Molecules with **cyclic ureas or hydantoin-like structures** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1...`) consistently have this value. Examples:
     - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (0.78791796)
     - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C` (0.78791796)
     - `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (0.78791796)

3. **Property ≈ -1.85787415**:
   - Molecules with **alcohol groups (-OH)** or **phenolic groups** (OH attached to benzene rings) often have this value. Examples:
     - `CCC(O)CC` (-1.85787415)
     - `OC1CCCCCCC1` (-1.85787415)
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (-1.85787415)
     - `CO` (-1.85787415)

4. **Other Notable Patterns**:
   - **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** in non-cyclic contexts (e.g., `CCC(=O)CC`) tend to have values around -1.32581932.
   - **Nitro groups (NO2)** (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O`) correlate with higher positive values (1.04384445).
   - **Thiol or sulfur-containing groups** (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)`) can lead to very negative values (-2.8093902).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, which can be broken down as:
- A **benzofuran-like structure** with a **lactam (cyclic amide)** group (`oc(=O)[nH]`).
- A **chlorine substitution** on the benzene ring (`Clc2ccc...`).

#### Key Features:
1. **Chlorine substitution**: From the examples, Cl on aromatic rings often leads to 0.0, but this is not absolute if other polar groups dominate.
2. **Lactam group (`oc(=O)[nH]`)**: This resembles cyclic amides/ureas, which in the examples have values ≈ 0.78791796 (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1...`).
3. **No alcohol (-OH) or phenol group**: Rules out the -1.85787415 value.

#### Conflicting Influences:
- The Cl substitution might push toward 0.0, but the lactam group is strongly associated with ≈ 0.78791796.
- The lactam group is more polar and likely dominates over the Cl substitution.

### Prediction:
The lactam group is the most dominant feature, and its presence in similar cyclic structures consistently gives ≈ 0.78791796. Thus, the predicted property value is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.78791796**
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5582009080148314
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., Cc1cccc(C)c1C, CCCCCl) typically have a property value of 0.0
2. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) appear to increase the property value when attached to aromatic systems (e.g., Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has 0.93193066)
3. The property seems to be related to molecular polarity or electron distribution

For the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O (isopropyl nitrite or 2-nitropropane):
- It's an aliphatic compound with a nitro group
- The nitro group is attached to a secondary carbon (not aromatic)
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO (aromatic with nitro) has 0.93193066
  - Simple aliphatics have 0.0
  - The value should be between these, but likely closer to the aromatic nitro compounds than to simple aliphatics

Based on the examples where nitro groups appear to contribute ~0.9-1.0 to the property value when attached to aromatic systems, and considering this is an aliphatic nitro compound, I would estimate the value to be slightly lower but still significant.

Predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O: 0.75

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.7705344358530949
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. 

Let's analyze the given molecule:
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

Key features:
1. It is a steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (complexity similar to some of the larger molecules in the examples).
2. It contains polar functional groups: hydroxyl (`OH`), carbonyl (`C=O`), and an alcohol (`CO`)).
3. It lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or halogens) or strongly electron-donating groups (like amines) that would significantly shift the property value.
4. The presence of the `C(=O)CO` (glycol-like) and `C(=O)` (ketone) groups suggests some polarity, but the overall structure is largely hydrophobic.

Comparing to similar molecules in the examples:
- **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** has a property value of **-1.52033108**. This is a steroid-like molecule with two carbonyl groups and fused rings, similar to the given molecule.
- Other complex molecules with carbonyls and hydroxyls (e.g., **CCCOC(=O)C**, **CCCCOC=O**) have very negative values (**-8.22430324**), but these are smaller and more polar.
- The given molecule is larger and less polar than these, so its value should be less negative.

Given these observations, the property value is likely close to **-1.52033108** (similar to the steroid-like example above) but slightly adjusted due to the additional polar groups (`OH` and `CO`). 

### Predicted property value: **-1.6** (approximate, likely between -1.5 and -2.0). 

For precision, I would estimate **-1.65** as a reasonable interpolation. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on pattern-matching from the given examples.)

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.24719398864257447
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values from the training data:

### Key Observations from Training Data:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains (e.g., CCCC...Br, CCCC...CCCC)**: Typically have a property value of **0.0** unless functionalized with polar groups (e.g., -OH, =O).
2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Alcohols (-OH)**: Often associated with values around **-1.85787415** (e.g., `CCCC(O)CC`, `CCC(O)CC`).
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: Values vary but can be **-1.32581932** (e.g., `CCCCCC=O`).
   - **Amides (N-C=O)**: Mixed effects; some amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) have **0.15621638**, while others like `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` have **-1.01144364**.
   - **Aromatic Rings**: Neutral (0.0) unless substituted with polar groups (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1` lowers the value).
3. **Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Alone on aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`), they contribute **0.0**.
   - When combined with polar groups (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`), they reinforce negative values (~**-1.85787415**).
4. **Complex Polar Groups**:
   - `C=O` in rings or conjugated systems (e.g., `CC34CCc1c(ccc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O`) gives **-1.09445415**.
   - Urea-like groups (`NC(=O)NC(=O)`) are not directly in the training data, but similar amides/ureas have values between **-1.0** and **+0.5**.

### Analysis of Target Molecule: `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`
1. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Two benzene rings, one with **F** substitutions (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`), another with **Cl** (`Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`). Halogens alone on aromatics suggest **0.0** contribution, but the polar linker changes this.
2. **Polar Linker**: `C(=O)NC(=O)N` is a **urea-like group** (two amides linked by N). Similar to `NC(=O)N` or `NC(=S)N` in training:
   - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` → **-1.01144364**
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` → **0.15621638**
   - Urea is more polar than a single amide, likely pushing the value further negative.
3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The urea group dominates, likely giving a value between **-1.0** and **0.0**.
   - The **F** and **Cl** substitutions are neutral unless combined with polar groups (here, they are adjacent to the urea, slightly reinforcing polarity).

### Prediction:
Given the urea-like core and halogenated aromatics, the closest analog in the training data is `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (**-1.01144364**). The target molecule has a more polar urea group (two C=O) but lacks additional polar groups (e.g., -OH) that would push it to ~**-1.85787415**. Thus, the predicted value is slightly less negative than **-1.01144364**.

**Final Predicted Property Value: -0.93657973**  
*(This matches the value for `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which also has a polar group (P=S) and Cl-substituted aromatic, suggesting a similar balance of polarity and halogens.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.5468783295589141
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value tends to be **0.0** for simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCC1CCCC1`, `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`, `CCSCC`) and halogenated hydrocarbons without polar functional groups (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `Cl\C=C/Cl`).  

However, when oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-O-**, **-C=O**) are present, the property tends to deviate from zero, often taking negative values (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` → **-1.85787415**, `CCCCCO` → **-1.85787415**, `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1=O` → **-1.09445415**).  

The molecule in question, **`CCCOC(C)C`**, is an ether (with an **-O-** linkage) and has no additional strongly polar groups. Comparing it to similar structures:  
- `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (tertiary alcohol) → **-1.85787415**  
- `CCCCCO` (primary alcohol) → **-1.85787415**  
- `CCOC(=O)CC` (ester) → **-8.22430324**  

Since **`CCCOC(C)C`** is less polar than an alcohol but still has an oxygen, I predict its property value will be **closer to zero than alcohols but still negative**.  

Looking at similar ethers in the dataset:  
- `CCOC(=O)CC` (ester, more polar) → **-8.22430324**  
- `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (phosphate ester) → **-0.44246481**  
- `CC1CCCO1` (cyclic ether) → **-0.54687833**  

Since **`CCCOC(C)C`** is a simple aliphatic ether, I estimate its value to be **around -0.5 to -1.0**, similar to `CC1CCCO1`.  

### Final Prediction:  
**`-0.54687833`** (same as `CC1CCCO1`, another simple ether)  

*(Note: If the exact value must match a training example, this is the closest fit. If interpolation is allowed, a value like `-0.6` might also be reasonable.)*  

**Answer:** **`-0.54687833`**

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.10770406533533938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds (e.g., Cl or Br substituents on benzene rings)**:
   - Many fully halogenated or symmetrically substituted aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - However, if the halogen is combined with polar or functional groups (e.g., CO, NH, OH), the property value deviates from 0.0 (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of **-2.8093902**).

2. **Heterocyclic Compounds with Polar Groups**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) and polar groups (e.g., C=O, NH) often have non-zero property values. For example:
     - Nc1nccs1: **-0.92252444**
     - CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1: **0.41469233**
     - COc2cnc1cncnc1n2: **0.34566089**

3. **Carbonyl (C=O) and Amide (N-C=O) Groups**:
   - Molecules with amide or carbonyl groups tend to have moderate positive or negative values. For example:
     - O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC: **0.78791796**
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: **-2.8093902**

4. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine substituents, especially when combined with polar groups, can lead to negative values (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: **-2.8093902**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** has the following features:
- A **bromine substituent** (Br) on a heterocyclic ring.
- A **five-membered heterocycle** with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and an NH group.
- An **alkyl substituent** (CCC(C)).

This structure resembles:
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycles with polar groups (e.g., C=O, NH) and halogen (Br) substitution.
- The presence of Br and C=O/NH suggests a possible negative or moderate positive value, similar to examples like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (**-2.8093902**) or CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1 (**0.41469233**).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with Br, C=O, and NH groups, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is **-0.16804762** (similar to CCCc1c(C)nc(nc1O)N(C)C, which also has polar groups and alkyl substituents).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** is **-0.16804762**.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be **0.0** for molecules that are purely hydrocarbon-based (containing only carbon and hydrogen) and lack functional groups, conjugation, or significant structural features that would influence the property (e.g., biphenyls, polyaromatics, or simple alkanes/alkenes). 

The molecule in question, **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), fits this pattern:
- It is a symmetric hydrocarbon with two benzene rings linked by a single bond.
- No heteroatoms (N, O, S, etc.), halogens, or polar functional groups are present.
- Similar examples like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (coronene) and **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted biphenyl derivative) also have a property value of **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **biphenyl** is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatics without polar groups)** typically have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` (bicyclic hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `CCC1CCCCC1` (cyclohexane with propyl) → 0.0
   - `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) → 0.0

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups** (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, hydroxyl, halogens, amines, sulfonamides) tend to have **non-zero values**, either positive or negative, depending on the specific group and context.

3. **Sulfur-containing molecules**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` (complex thiophosphate) → 0.15025328
   - `CCCCc1c(C)nc(NCC)[nH]c1=O` (thioamide-like) → 0.23047722
   - `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` (thiourea-like) → -0.20144516
   - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (thiophosphate) → -1.53289284

The molecule in question is **`CCCCS` (butyl mercaptan, a simple thiol)**. 

### Prediction:
- It is a simple hydrocarbon chain with a single **thiol (-SH) group**, which is polar but not as strongly interacting as the more complex sulfur-containing groups in the examples (e.g., thiophosphates or thioureas). 
- The closest analogs in the given data are simple hydrocarbons (which are 0.0) or very weakly polar sulfur compounds (which are close to 0.0). 
- Since no other simple thiols are in the dataset, and given the lack of additional polar/charged groups, the property value is likely **0.0** or very close to it. 

Given the conservative approach, the predicted property value for **`CCCCS`** is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and patterns observed in the data, I can predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohol (-OH) groups** often lead to negative property values when attached to aliphatic chains or rings. For example:
   - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` → -1.85787415  
   - `CC(C)CC(C)O` → -1.85787415  
   - `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` → -1.85787415  
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -1.85787415  

2. The **tertiary carbon with an -OH group** (as in `CCCC(C)(C)CO`) is structurally similar to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` and `CC(C)CC(C)O`, which both have a value of **-1.85787415**.

3. Other functional groups (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, carbonyls) or aromatic systems can modify the property value, but in this case, the molecule is purely aliphatic with an -OH group.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is expected to have the same property value as the other aliphatic tertiary alcohols in the dataset:  
**-1.85787415**.  

### Final Answer:  
**-1.85787415**

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** and predict its property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic hydrocarbons without polar or functional groups** (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Cc1cccc(C)c1C`, `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**.
   - These molecules lack electronegative atoms (like O, N, S) or polar functional groups (like NO₂, C=O, OH, etc.).
   - They are purely hydrocarbon systems (with or without halogens like Cl, Br, I).

2. **The given molecule `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAH):
   - It has no polar or functional groups (only C and H atoms).
   - It is structurally similar to `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` and `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene derivatives), which also have a property value of **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
Since `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is a purely aromatic hydrocarbon with no polar or functional groups, its predicted property value is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.7879179583692381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.78791796**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with **C(C)CCC** (a branched alkyl chain) and **CC=C** (an alkenyl group). 
   - Compared to the example molecule (which has **C** and **CC=C**), this molecule has a slightly larger hydrophobic substituent (**C(C)CCC**).

3. **Property Trends**:
   - Molecules with **polar/hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., OH, NH, C=O)** tend to have non-zero property values (positive or negative).
   - **Hydrophobic/aliphatic chains (e.g., CCC, CC=C)** tend to reduce the magnitude of the property (closer to zero) unless they are part of a larger polar framework.
   - The presence of **multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)** and **NH groups** suggests moderate polarity, similar to the example with a value of **0.78791796**.

4. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (0.78791796)**. Here, the substituent is bulkier (**C(C)CCC** instead of **C**), which may slightly reduce the property magnitude due to increased hydrophobicity.
   - Another similar molecule is **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1 (-2.8093902)**, but this has an aromatic system and iodine, which are not present here.
   - The **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (-3.58100994)** example is highly negative due to the azo group, which is not relevant here.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (0.78791796)** but with a slightly more hydrophobic substituent, the property value is expected to be **slightly lower** but still positive. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.65**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data. The true value could vary depending on the specific property, e.g., solubility, binding affinity, etc.)

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I can make the following observations to predict its property value:

1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with simple alkyl or halogen substituents on benzene rings (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1CC**, **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**, **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**) have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that uncomplicated aromatic systems with non-polar or weakly polar substituents default to zero.

2. **Polar or Functionalized Aromatic Systems**:
   - When the aromatic ring has polar or strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups (e.g., **COc1ccccc1O**, **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**), the property value deviates from zero (e.g., **-2.65862227** for a methoxy-phenol, **-1.85787415** for bromophenol).
   - The trifluoromethyl group (**CF3**) is strongly electron-withdrawing but not as polar as hydroxyl or methoxy groups. Its impact is likely less dramatic than groups like **OH** or **OCH3**.

3. **Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of **0.0**, suggesting that even multiple halogens on aromatic rings may not always change the property value if the system remains symmetric and non-polar overall.
   - **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a **CF3** group, which is bulkier and more polar than simple halogens but not as polar as hydroxyl or nitro groups.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxy-phenol) has a value of **-2.65862227**, but this has two polar substituents.
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (bromophenol) has a value of **-1.85787415**, with one polar **OH** group.
   - **CF3** is less polar than **OH**, so the value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** should be closer to zero than **-1.85787415**.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** likely has a property value slightly below zero but not as negative as molecules with hydroxyl or methoxy groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.5**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend. The exact value might differ if the property is sensitive to specific electronic effects of **CF3**.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.4701476940798903
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (specifically, a hexose sugar like glucose or mannitol with multiple hydroxyl groups).

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = 1.62534774) tend to have positive property values, likely due to high polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity.
- The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar to the above example but with a cyclic structure. Cyclic sugars with multiple hydroxyl groups are also highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding.

Comparing to the linear polyol (**OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = 1.62534774), the cyclic form might have a slightly lower value due to reduced flexibility and solvent accessibility, but the effect is likely small. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is approximately:  
**1.5 to 1.6** (closer to 1.6, given the strong similarity to the linear polyol example).  

A precise estimate would be:  
**1.5846022** (matching the trend of highly polar, multi-hydroxyl molecules in the dataset).  

However, since the linear polyol is 1.62534774, and the cyclic form is slightly less flexible, a reasonable prediction is:  
**1.5846022** (aligning with other high-polarity examples like **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NC(NS1(=O)=O)C(Cl)Cl)cc2Cl**, which has a value of 1.5846022).  

Final predicted property value: **1.5846022**.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.3191491229396421
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall polarity. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key observations about this molecule:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule contains several ketone (C=O) and ester (C(=O)O) groups, which are polar and often contribute negatively to the property (as seen in other examples with C=O groups).
2. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: The presence of an alcohol group (OH) can increase polarity, but its effect depends on context (e.g., in polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, the property is highly positive).
3. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a fused ring system resembling steroids or terpenes. Examples like `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2` (property = 0.787) and `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property = -0.541) suggest moderate values for such structures.
4. **Conjugated double bonds**: The `C=CC=C` fragment may slightly lower the property (similar to aromatic systems, which often have negative values).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property = -0.541) is structurally very similar but lacks the additional hydroxyl groups and has fewer carbonyls. The additional polar groups in the query molecule would likely push the property further negative.
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (property = -1.094) has a similar steroid backbone with fewer polar groups, suggesting the query molecule could be more negative.

### Predicted property:
Given the additional polar groups (C=O, OH) and the steroid-like structure, the property is likely more negative than -0.541 but not as extreme as some highly polar or halogenated examples (e.g., -1.857). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  

This aligns with the trend where molecules with multiple polar groups in a complex fused-ring system tend to have moderately negative values.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -1.094454151929965
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, I can make the following observations:

1. The property appears to be related to molecular polarity or some form of dipole-related characteristic, as molecules with significant polar functional groups (like carbonyls, hydroxyls, etc.) tend to have non-zero values, while purely hydrocarbon structures typically have values of 0.0.

2. The molecule in question (CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O) is a steroid-like structure with:
   - One carbonyl group (C=O)
   - One hydroxyl group (OH)
   - Multiple aliphatic rings

3. Looking at similar structures in the examples:
   - CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a value of -0.77654681
   - This is very similar to our molecule, being a polycyclic structure with hydroxyl groups

4. Other hydroxyl-containing examples:
   - Oc1ccccc1Cl: -1.85787415
   - Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O: -0.77654681
   - CCCCCCC(O)CC: -1.85787415

5. The presence of both a carbonyl and hydroxyl group in our molecule suggests it should have a value similar to other such structures, likely in the range of -0.7 to -1.8.

Given the closest structural similarity to CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O (which has the same basic steroid framework with hydroxyl group), I predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O to be:

-0.77654681

This matches the value seen for the most structurally similar example in the training set.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7073236426957857
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O), we can deduce the property value by identifying structural patterns and comparing them to the provided data. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - When attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., O=N(=O)c1ccccc1), the property value is **-0.55820091**.
   - When attached to a more complex aromatic system (e.g., O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12), the value is the same (**-0.55820091**), suggesting the nitro group's contribution is consistent.
   - In COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (methoxy-nitrobenzene), the value is **-0.00733143**, indicating that electron-donating groups (like methoxy) slightly increase the property compared to plain nitrobenzene.

2. **Amide groups (C(=O)N)**:
   - In CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1, the property is **-1.84786621**, but this is a cyclic amide with additional alkyl groups.
   - In O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2, the property is **1.12097495**, but this is a more complex system with multiple functional groups.

3. **Combined nitro and amide groups**:
   - The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has both an amide (C(=O)N) and a nitro (N(=O)=O) group on the same aromatic ring. This is similar to COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (methoxy-nitrobenzene, **-0.00733143**), but with an amide instead of methoxy.
   - Amides are electron-withdrawing (like nitro groups), but less so than nitro groups alone. The amide in this case is conjugated with the ring, which may slightly offset the nitro group's effect.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitrobenzene alone is **-0.55820091**.
- Methoxy-nitrobenzene (electron-donating) is **-0.00733143**.
- The amide is less electron-donating than methoxy but still modulates the nitro group's effect.

The property for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely **between the nitrobenzene and methoxy-nitrobenzene values**, closer to the methoxy-nitrobenzene due to the amide's conjugation. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.2 to -0.1**.  

However, looking for closer analogs, the value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is **-0.00733143**, and the amide is somewhat similar in its modulating effect. Thus, the predicted property is approximately:  
**-0.1**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.1** (approximate, based on structural analogs).  

(Note: Without a direct example of an amide-nitrobenzene, this is an educated interpolation. The exact value might differ slightly, but this is a plausible estimate given the data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.05080301482612252
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property value for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` by identifying patterns in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Aromatics**: 
   - Molecules like `Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13`, `CCC#CCC`, `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`, and `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically non-polar or symmetrically substituted aromatic/halogenated compounds.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (`OCc1ccccc1`, `CCC(C)CO`, `CCCO`) and phenols (`Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) tend to have a value around **-1.85787415**.
   - Esters (`CCCC(=O)OC`, `CC(C)OC(=O)C`) have a much more negative value (**-8.22430324**), likely due to their polarity and dipole moment.
   - Carbonyl groups (e.g., in `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) often give values around **-1.52033108**.

3. **Nitrogen-Containing Groups**:
   - Nitriles (`CC#N`, `CCC#N`) have a very negative value (**-2.9847036**).
   - Amides and heterocyclic nitrogen compounds (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`) have positive values (~**0.78791796**).

4. **Complex or Mixed Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`) have intermediate values (**-0.61247134**).
   - Phosphorus or sulfur-containing compounds (e.g., `CSSC`) tend to have **0.0** unless combined with other polar groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` has:
- A **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)`), which is polar and contains sulfur.
- An **ester-like linkage** (`SCn1c(=O)oc2...`), which is somewhat similar to esters (very negative values in examples).
- A **chlorinated aromatic ring** (`cc(Cl)ccc12`), which alone would suggest **0.0**.
- A **heterocyclic lactam-like moiety** (`n1c(=O)oc2...`), which could contribute a positive or small negative value.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate (polar, sulfur) and the ester-like group, the value is likely negative. However, the heterocycle and aromatic Cl may offset this slightly. 

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- Esters: **-8.22430324** (very negative).
- Thioesters or sulfur-containing compounds: **0.0** (e.g., `CSSC`).
- Heterocycles with carbonyls: **-0.04713055** (e.g., `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2`).

The phosphorothioate is more polar than a simple thioether but less than a pure ester. The heterocycle and Cl aromatic ring may pull the value toward zero. 

### Predicted Value:
Given the competing effects, I predict a value between **-1.0 and -2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.31514934** (similar to `O=Cc2ccc1OCOc1c2`, which has a polar carbonyl and aromatic ether).

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - Simple alcohols like `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)CO`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O`, `CCCCC(CC)CO`, and `CCCC(O)CCC` all have the property value **-1.85787415**.
   - The presence of an -OH group on an aliphatic chain (especially with branching) consistently gives this value.

2. **No polar functional groups**:
   - Molecules like `CCC`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`, and `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (no polar groups) have a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Other functional groups**:
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), halogens, and complex heterocycles lead to varied values (e.g., positive or negative, depending on the rest of the structure).

### Prediction for `CC(C)(C)CO`:
- This is a tertiary alcohol (`(CH3)3CCH2OH`, neopentyl alcohol).
- It fits the pattern of aliphatic alcohols with an -OH group, similar to the other alcohols listed above.
- Therefore, its property value should be the same as the other simple alcohols: **-1.85787415**.

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.7660853661149023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Heterocycles with Multiple Nitrogens and Oxygen**:
   - Molecules with aromatic heterocycles containing multiple nitrogen atoms (e.g., pyrimidines, purines, or imidazoles) often have non-zero property values, especially if they include polar groups like carbonyl (C=O) or hydroxyl (OH).
   - Example: **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** has a property value of **0.69434824**, and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** also has **0.69434824**. These molecules share a similar structural motif of a nitrogen-rich aromatic ring with a carbonyl group.

2. **Neutral or Non-Polar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F), aliphatic chains, or simple aromatic systems (e.g., benzene derivatives without polar substituents) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Example: **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**, **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, and **c1ccccc1SC** all have **0.0**.

3. **Carbonyl Groups in Aromatic Systems**:
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in an aromatic or conjugated system often leads to negative or positive non-zero values, depending on the surrounding functional groups.
   - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** has **0.78791796**, while **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has **-2.8093902**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is a **purine-like structure** with:
- A fused bicyclic aromatic system (imidazole + pyrimidine).
- Two nitrogen atoms in the ring (contributing to polarity).
- A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1, which is highly polar.
- Two NH groups (hydrogen bond donors).

This structure is very similar to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1**, which both have a property value of **0.69434824**. The only difference is the absence of the fluorine substituent and the exact ring fusion, but the core features (C=O, aromatic nitrogens, NH groups) are identical.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to the two examples with **0.69434824**, the predicted property value for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is:

**0.69434824**
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional groups. Let's analyze the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate with an isopropyl group, or more accurately, isopropyl formate) and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key observations from the dataset:
1. **Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CC(C)O, CC(O)C(C)(C)C, CCCCCCCO)**: These consistently have a property value of **-1.85787415**.
2. **Ethers (e.g., CCOC(C)C, CCOC=C)**: These have a value of **-0.54687833**.
3. **Esters (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2...)**: These vary but often have moderately negative or positive values.
4. **Carbonyl compounds (e.g., CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4..., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1)**: These tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.54110894, -2.8093902).
5. **Simple hydrocarbons or halogenated compounds (e.g., CCC(C)(C)C, ClCC(Cl)Cl, Brc1ccc(Br)cc1)**: These consistently have a value of **0.0**.

### Analysis of CC(C)OC=O:
- This is an ester (isopropyl formate), similar to other esters in the dataset.
- It has a polar carbonyl (C=O) and an ether-like (O) linkage, but no hydroxyl group.
- Compared to **CCOC(C)C** (an ether with value -0.54687833), the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) might make the property more negative.
- The closest analog in the dataset is **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester with value -0.44246481), but this is more complex.
- Another close analog is **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O** (value 1.13964087), but this has additional functional groups.

Given the ester nature and lack of strong hydrogen bonding or aromaticity, a reasonable estimate would be between the ether value (-0.54687833) and the alcohol value (-1.85787415). Since esters are more polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols, a value closer to the ether but slightly more negative is plausible.

### Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O:
**-0.8** (approximate, based on interpolation between ether and alcohol values). 

However, looking more closely, **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...** (a steroid-like ester) has a value of **-0.54110894**, which is close to the ether value. Thus, for **CC(C)OC=O**, a simpler ester, a value slightly more negative than -0.54687833 (ether) but not as negative as -1.85787415 (alcohol) is reasonable.

### Final prediction:
**-0.7** (intermediate between ether and alcohol, accounting for the ester's polarity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.7183204188095006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with simple aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) or halogen-substituted aromatics (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**) often have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups are present.
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing or polar substituents (e.g., **-NO2**, **-CHO**, **-OH**, **-Br**) tend to have negative property values.

2. **Amide and Urea-like Groups**:
   - Molecules with amide (**-CONH-**) or urea-like (**-NHCONH-**) groups often have negative or slightly positive property values, depending on the context.
     - Example: **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has a value of **0.15621638** (slightly positive).
     - Example: **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** has a value of **-0.98180028** (negative).

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - Symmetrical molecules or those with extended conjugation (e.g., **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**) often have property values influenced by the additive effects of their functional groups.

4. **Specific Examples**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has a value of **-1.85787415** (phenol + chloro substituent).
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** has a value of **-0.98180028** (amide + aromatic).
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has a value of **0.15621638** (amide + aromatic).

### Analysis of **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**:
- This is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms (**-NHPh**). The structure is symmetrical and features:
  - A central urea (**-NHCONH-**) group.
  - Two aromatic rings (phenyl groups).
- Urea groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may influence the property value.
- The symmetry and lack of strongly electron-withdrawing substituents suggest a moderate negative or near-zero value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (amide + aromatic): **-0.98180028**.
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (amide + aromatic): **0.15621638**.
- The urea group in **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is more polar than a simple amide but less polar than a highly substituted amide. The symmetry may balance out some effects.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is likely slightly negative, similar to other amide/urea-containing aromatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.5 to -0.8**

However, looking for the closest analog in the examples:
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (amide + aromatic, slightly more complex): **-0.98180028**.
- The urea here is more polar but symmetrical, so we might expect a value slightly less negative than **-0.98180028**.

**Final Prediction: -0.77654681**  
*(This matches the value for* **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O**, *which is also a symmetrical, polar aromatic molecule, though not identical. Given the trends, this is a plausible estimate.)*  

However, since the urea group is more polar than a simple amide, let's adjust slightly:

**Adjusted Prediction: -0.85**  

But to match the closest example, **-0.77654681** seems reasonable. 

**Final Answer: -0.77654681**

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to be **0.0** for molecules that are purely aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, `Sc1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`, `CCCc1ccccc1`, etc.) or symmetric halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`). 

The molecule in question, **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, is a **fluorene** derivative (a fused tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon). Since it lacks polar or strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups (like nitro, carbonyl, halogens beyond symmetry, or heteroatoms with lone pairs), and given the trend in the examples, its property value is likely:

### **Predicted Property Value: 0.0**  

This aligns with the observed pattern where simple aromatic systems without significant functionalization or asymmetry yield a value of 0.0.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 1.634343692758826
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's break down the structural features that correlate with the property values:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **High Positive Values (>1.0)**:
   - Typically seen in molecules with multiple polar/ionic groups (e.g., `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` = 1.087, `COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC2OC(...)` = 2.269).
   - Often involve sulfonamides (`S(=O)(=O)N`), nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), or multiple heterocycles.

2. **Moderate Positive Values (0.1–1.0)**:
   - Seen in molecules with one polar group (e.g., `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` = 0.957, `CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2` = 0.199).

3. **Near Zero (0.0)**:
   - Common for simple hydrocarbons (`CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`), halocarbons (`ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl)Cl`), or non-polar aromatics (`Cc1ccccc1C`).

4. **Negative Values**:
   - Associated with small polar groups (e.g., `OCc1ccccc1` = -1.858, `CC(C)C(=O)C` = -1.326).

### Target Molecule: **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**
- **Structural Features**:
  - A sulfonamide (`S(=O)(=O)N`) linked to an aromatic ring with an amine (`N`).
  - A guanidine-like group (`NC(=N)N`), which is highly polar and often positively charged.
  - Multiple nitrogen-based functional groups (high polarity).

- **Comparison to Examples**:
  - Similar to `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` (1.087) and `O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12` (-0.350), but with more polar groups.
  - The sulfonamide + guanidine + aromatic amine combination suggests stronger polarity than most examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the high polarity and multiple charged/polar groups, the value is likely **>1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 1.45**  

This aligns with the trend that molecules with multiple strongly polar/ionic groups (e.g., sulfonamide + guanidine) have higher positive values.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.1102405552683967
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` by analyzing structural features and their correlation with the property values in the training set.

### Key Observations from the Training Set:
1. **Nitro Groups (`N(=O)=O`)**:
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a property value of **0.43666213**.
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a property value of **1.00799158**.
   - The presence of nitro groups tends to increase the property value, especially when multiple nitro groups are present.

2. **Fluorine Substituents (`C(F)(F)F`)**:
   - Fluorine substituents (e.g., `C(F)(F)F`) are not explicitly present in the training set, but halogen substituents like `Cl` or `Br` often result in a property value of **0.0** unless combined with other functional groups (e.g., nitro groups).

3. **Amine or Nitrogen-Containing Groups (`CCN(CC)`)**:
   - `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1` has a property value of **-0.16629015**.
   - Nitrogen-containing aliphatic groups (e.g., `CCN`) tend to slightly decrease the property value.

4. **Aromatic Systems with Multiple Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with multiple substituents (especially electron-withdrawing groups like nitro) tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` at **1.00799158**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has:
- Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), which are strongly electron-withdrawing and correlate with higher property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`), which is electron-withdrawing but may not significantly affect the property on its own.
- An aliphatic amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`), which may slightly decrease the property value.
- An aromatic ring with multiple substituents, similar to other molecules with higher property values.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
The closest analog in the training set is `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`, which has:
- A nitro group.
- A halogen (Cl).
- A complex aromatic system.
- Property value: **1.00799158**.

Our target molecule has:
- Two nitro groups (stronger effect than one).
- A trifluoromethyl group (similar to halogen in some respects).
- No carbonyl or other strongly contributing groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the two nitro groups and the overall structure, the property value is likely higher than **1.00799158** but not as high as some of the very large or polycyclic molecules (e.g., steroids with property values ~1.3). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**1.1** (approximate, likely between 1.0 and 1.3).

However, looking more closely, the molecule `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has one nitro group and a complex structure, yielding ~1.0. Our molecule has two nitro groups but lacks the additional complexity of the carbonyl and fused ring system in the reference. Thus, the effect of the second nitro group may not be additive, and the presence of the trifluoromethyl group may not significantly alter the property.

### Final Prediction:
**1.00799158** (same as the closest analog, since the additional nitro group and trifluoromethyl substituent may balance out). 

However, given that two nitro groups could reasonably increase the value slightly, I will adjust slightly upward to:  
**1.1**. 

But to be precise, the closest match suggests **1.00799158**, so I will stick with:  
**1.00799158**. 

### Exact Answer:
The predicted property value is **1.00799158**.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Halides**: 
   - Molecules like **ClC(Cl)Cl**, **c1ccccc1**, **C1CCCCCCC1**, **ClC=C**, and **C=CC=C** have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically non-polar or symmetric molecules with no significant functional groups affecting the property.

2. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(C)O**, **CCCCCCCCO**, **OC1CCCCCC1**, and **CCC(O)CC** all have the property value **-1.85787415**. This suggests that the presence of a simple hydroxyl group (**-OH**) on an aliphatic chain correlates with this value.

3. **Aldehydes (R-CHO)**:
   - Molecules like **CCCC=O** and **O=C1CCCCC1** have the property value **-1.32581932**. This suggests that the presence of an aldehyde group (**-CHO**) correlates with this value.

4. **Esters (R-COOR')**:
   - Molecules like **CC(C)CCOC=O**, **CCCCCOC(=O)C**, and **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** have the property value **-8.22430324**. These are esters where the **-COOR'** group is present.

5. **Complex or Mixed Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple or complex functional groups (e.g., aromatic rings with polar substituents, amides, nitro groups, etc.) have varying property values, often positive or near zero.

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester (specifically, **methyl acetate** with an isopropyl group replacing one methyl). Its structure is:
- **R-COOR'**, where **R = H** (formyl group) and **R' = isopropyl (CC(C))**.
- This is functionally similar to the other esters in the dataset (e.g., **CC(C)CCOC=O**, **CCCCCOC(=O)C**), which all have the property value **-8.22430324**.

### Conclusion:
Given that **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester and all other esters in the dataset have the property value **-8.22430324**, we can confidently predict the same value for this molecule.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-8.22430324**

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH groups tend to have positive property values, especially if they are aromatic (e.g., phenol derivatives). For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` has a high value of **1.05869582** (multiple -OH groups).
     - `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` has **1.42179351** (multiple -OH groups).
     - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has **1.62534774** (polyol).
   - However, simple aliphatic alcohols like `CO` (methanol) or `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) have very negative values (**-1.85787415**), suggesting that aromatic -OH alone may not always lead to positive values unless accompanied by other features.

2. **Methyl Groups (-CH3)**:
   - Methyl groups alone (e.g., `CC(C)C`, `CCCC(C)(C)C`) typically contribute to a property value of **0.0** unless combined with other functional groups.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings without polar substituents (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Aromatic rings with -OH or other polar groups can shift the value positively or negatively depending on the context.

4. **Combination of -OH and -CH3 on Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O` has a value of **1.4567152**, but this includes multiple polar groups (amide, sulfonamide, -OH, -Cl).
   - Simpler cases like `Cc1cccc(N)c1` have very negative values (**-5.92406254**), but this includes an -NH2 group, which may not be directly comparable.

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 3-methylphenol or m-cresol with an additional -OH at the 4-position).
- It has:
  - An aromatic ring.
  - One hydroxyl group (-OH).
  - Two methyl groups (-CH3).
- From the examples:
  - Phenol (`c1ccccc1O`) has a value of **-1.85787415**.
  - Methyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`) have **0.0**.
  - The presence of -OH in an aromatic ring with methyl groups could lead to a value between these extremes, likely slightly negative but not as extreme as phenol alone.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combination of -OH and -CH3 on an aromatic ring, and comparing to similar examples, the property value is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than phenol. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.5 to -0.8**

From the examples, the closest analogies suggest a value around **-0.77654681** (for `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC`, which has -OH and alkyl chains) or **-0.68149257** (for `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`, a heterocycle with -NH). 

Given the simplicity of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, a plausible prediction is:

**-0.7** (approximate, based on trends). 

However, looking at the examples more carefully, the value for phenol (`c1ccccc1O`) is **-1.85787415**, and adding methyl groups (which tend to neutralize the effect) would bring it closer to zero. Thus, a more precise estimate might be:

**-0.5** (since methyl groups partially offset the -OH effect).

### Final Answer:
**-0.5** (approximate predicted property value for `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. The true value could vary depending on the specific property's definition.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -3.6763136467241426
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphate/Thiophosphate Esters (P(=S)(OC)...)**:
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)(OC)** group (organothiophosphates) tend to have very negative property values, especially when attached to aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br, I). Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`: **-3.67631365**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`: **-3.67631365**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: **-3.67631365**
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) on the aromatic ring seems to further decrease the property value.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with **O** (hydroxy or ether) or **alkyl (C)** groups often have property values around **-1.85787415** (e.g., `OC1CCCCC1`, `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`).
   - Aromatic rings with **S** (thioether) or **N** (nitrogen-containing heterocycles) can deviate from this trend (e.g., `Oc1ccccn1`: **-1.69541248**).

3. **Non-Aromatic or Simple Aliphatic Structures**:
   - Simple aliphatic structures (e.g., `CC(C)C(C)(C)C`, `CCC#CCC`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain polar or functional groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**

- It contains the **P(=S)(OC)** group (like the organothiophosphates above), which strongly suggests a very negative property value.
- The aromatic ring has:
  - A **thioether (SC)** group (instead of halogens like Cl/Br/I in the examples).
  - A **methyl (C)** group.
- The **SC** group is less electronegative than halogens, so the property value may not be as extreme as **-3.67631365** but still very negative.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest examples are the organothiophosphates with halogens (**-3.67631365**). Replacing halogens with **SC** (less electronegative) might slightly increase the property value (less negative).
- Aromatic rings with **O** or **alkyl** groups (no halogens) tend to have values around **-1.85787415**, but the **P(=S)(OC)** group dominates here.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of the **P(=S)(OC)** group and the aromatic **SC** substituent (less electronegative than halogens), the property value is likely close to the organothiophosphate examples but slightly less negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -3.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities. The exact value would require computational or experimental validation.)

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatic systems** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups are present. Examples:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0**  
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0**  
   - `ClC(Cl)Cl` → **0.0**  
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` → **0.0**  

2. **Non-zero values** arise when other functional groups (e.g., NO₂, carbonyl, sulfonamide, etc.) are present. For example:
   - `Cc1ccccc1N` → **-5.92406254** (due to the aniline group).  
   - `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` → **0.0** (pure hydrocarbon).  

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- The target is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with no additional functional groups (only Cl substituents on aromatic rings).  
- It closely resembles the examples with multiple Cl atoms (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`), which all have **0.0**.  

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**  

This aligns with the trend that heavily halogenated aromatics without other functional groups default to **0.0** in the given dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5582009080148314
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on the functional groups and molecular structures:

1. **Alkanes, alkenes, and simple aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CC`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`, `c1ccccc1`, `C1CCCCC1`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**.

2. **Nitro groups (`NO2`)** tend to increase the property value significantly. For example:
   - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (three nitro groups) has a value of **1.72781918**.
   - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (no nitro group) has a value of **-0.26328849**, while similar nitro-substituted aromatics have higher values.

3. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** in certain contexts (e.g., ketones, aldehydes) often result in negative values around **-1.32581932** (e.g., `CCCCCC=O`, `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1=O`).

4. **Nitroalkanes** (e.g., `CCCN(=O)=O` is nitropentane) are not explicitly in the examples, but nitro groups generally increase the property value. The closest analog is `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`, which has a value of **1.11024056**, but this is a more complex molecule with two nitro groups and other substituents.

Given that `CCCN(=O)=O` is a simple nitroalkane with one nitro group, we can infer:
- It is not a hydrocarbon, so the value is unlikely to be 0.0.
- The nitro group will likely increase the value, but not as much as in highly substituted nitroaromatics.
- The closest simple nitro-containing molecule in the examples is `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (value: **-0.26328849**), but this is a nitrile, not a nitro group. Nitro groups are more polar and likely to increase the value more than nitriles.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for `CCCN(=O)=O` would be slightly positive, around **0.5 to 1.0**. Given the examples, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75105247**  
*(This matches the value of `CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC`, which is another polar molecule with a nitro-like fragment, though not identical. The exact value is uncertain without more nitroalkane examples, but this is a reasonable interpolation.)*

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, BrC(Br)Br) tend to have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack additional functional groups or complex structural features.
   
2. **Aromatic rings with halogens and no other functional groups** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl) consistently have a property value of **0.0**.

3. The presence of **additional functional groups** (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, amine, ether) or **complex structural features** (e.g., fused rings, long aliphatic chains) tends to shift the property value away from 0.0, either positively or negatively.

### Analysis of Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- The molecule is a **simple halogenated aromatic compound** with fluorine (F) and bromine (Br) substituents on a benzene ring.
- It lacks any additional functional groups or complex structural features (e.g., no nitro, carbonyl, or amine groups).
- This is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, which both have a property value of **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
Since **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a simple halogenated aromatic compound with no other functional groups, its property value is likely **0.0**, consistent with the examples provided.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)**: 
   - Simple alkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they have significant functional groups or complexity.
   - Branched or cyclic hydrocarbons without polar groups often have **0.0**.

2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:
   - Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)O, CC(C)(C)CO) often have values around **-1.85787415**.
   - Ethers (e.g., CCCOCCC, CC1CCCO1) have values around **-0.54687833**.
   - Carbonyl groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)C, COC(=O)c1ccccc1) tend to have very negative values (e.g., **-8.22430324**).

3. **Complex or polycyclic structures with oxygen**:
   - Molecules with multiple rings and oxygen (e.g., CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO) have positive values (e.g., **1.17900384**).
   - Similar structures with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups (e.g., CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO) have values around **1.21203054**.

4. **Specific case for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**:
   - This is a bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol (similar to some of the complex polycyclic examples).
   - It lacks highly polar or charged groups (like carbonyls or sulfonamides) that would push the value to extremes.
   - The hydroxyl group suggests a moderate negative contribution, but the rigid bicyclic structure may offset this.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: This has a very similar core structure (polycyclic with hydroxyl and carbonyl) and a value of **1.17900384**.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Also similar, with a value of **1.21203054**.
- The given molecule is simpler (no carbonyl or fluorine), so the value should be slightly lower but still positive due to the rigid polycyclic structure.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the polycyclic examples with hydroxyl groups (which have values ~1.2), but lacking the additional polar groups (carbonyl, fluorine), the value is likely slightly lower but still positive. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.8** (approximate, based on the trend of polycyclic + hydroxyl structures). 

However, looking more closely, the molecule is almost identical to parts of the larger polycyclic examples, so the value could be closer to **1.0**. 

Given the examples, the most precise estimate is:  
**1.0** (interpolating between the simpler hydrocarbons at 0.0 and the more complex polycyclics at ~1.2). 

But to match the exact trend, let's round to:  
**1.17900384** (same as the very similar example). 

However, since the given molecule is simpler, a slight reduction is fair:  
**1.0**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is **1.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.2** due to the polycyclic + hydroxyl structure.) 

For precision, I would predict:  
**1.0**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.15025328245877984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **phthalimide-like moiety** (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`), which is also present in one of the provided examples:
   - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a property value of **0.15025328**.
   The core phthalimide is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The given molecule has a **diethyl phosphorothioate group** (`CCOP(=S)(OCC)` attached to the nitrogen of the phthalimide.
   - The example molecule has a **diethyl phosphorodithioate group** (`CCOP(=S)(OCC)S`) and an additional `C(CCl)` substituent on the nitrogen.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - The example has an extra `S` and `C(CCl)` group, which may slightly increase the property value due to additional polarizability or steric effects.
   - The given molecule lacks these but retains the `P(=S)(OCC)` group, which is still polar and moderately electron-withdrawing.

### Comparison to Other Examples:
- The phthalimide core with moderately polar substituents (e.g., `P(=S)`) tends to have property values in the **range of 0.1 to 0.2** (as seen in the example with 0.15025328).
- Simpler phthalimides or less polar substituents (e.g., alkyl groups) often have values closer to 0.0.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the example with a property value of **0.15025328**, but with slightly reduced polarity (no `S` or `C(CCl)`), the property value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` should be **slightly lower** but still in the same general range. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.12** (approximate, based on the closest example and adjusting for substituent differences). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -4.634759326731203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms or Polar Groups**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen (especially carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - **CCCCOC** (ether): -0.54687833
     - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (aromatic with N and C=O): -1.40550267
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (multiple C=O and N): 0.78791796
     - **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (amide-like): -2.86764415

2. **Non-Polar or Saturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - Molecules like **CC(C)CC(C)(C)C**, **CCCCI**, or **C1CCCCCC1** (no polar groups or unsaturation) have a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - The presence of C=O (ketone, aldehyde, amide) often leads to negative values (e.g., **CCCCCC(=O)C**: -1.32581932, **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -1.32581932).

4. **Aromatic Nitrogen Heterocycles**:
   - Molecules like **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (indole-like): -1.16116252
   - **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (imidazole-like): -0.04713055

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has the following features:
- A fused aromatic system with two nitrogen atoms (one adjacent to a carbonyl group, C=O).
- A methyl group (**C**) attached to the nitrogen.
- A phenyl ring (**c2ccccc2**) attached to the other nitrogen.
- The structure resembles a **dihydropyrimidinone** or **quinazolinone** core, which is polar due to the C=O and N atoms.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property: -1.40550267):
   - Similar fused aromatic system with C=O and N.
   - The target molecule is slightly less conjugated (no fused benzene ring on the C=O side), but the C=O and N are present.
2. **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property: -1.16116252):
   - Less polar than the target (no C=O), but similar aromatic N-heterocycle.
3. **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property: -2.86764415):
   - Highly polar due to two amide-like N-C=O groups, but the target is less extreme.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- Aromatic N-heterocycle with C=O (similar to -1.40550267 but less conjugated).
- No extreme polarity like amides (unlike -2.86764415).

The property value is likely between **-1.2 and -1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.35** (close to -1.40550267 for the most similar example). 

### Final Answer:
**-1.35** (approximate, based on structural similarity to given examples).

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC(=C)C, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1, CCCCC) consistently have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, I) that don't contain other functional groups also tend to have 0.0 (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1ccccc1I).

3. Molecules with ester groups (COC=O, CCCCCOC(=O)OC) have a property value of -8.22430324.

4. The molecule CCCC(=O)O is not in the examples, but similar esters show -8.22430324.

5. The target molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester (hexanoic acid ethyl ester), similar to the other ester examples.

Given this pattern, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC would be:

-8.22430324
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with certain molecular features. 

The molecule in question is **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, which is **methyl benzoate**. 

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
1. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** has a property value of **0.00374462**. This is a diester with a long aliphatic chain, which likely reduces its impact on the property.
2. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-8.22430324**, which is an extreme outlier compared to most other examples. This suggests that simple aromatic esters (especially with small alkyl groups) may have very low property values.
3. **CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2** has a value of **-0.48692877**, but this is a more complex heterocyclic ester.

Given that **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is structurally very similar to **ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)**, which has a value of **-8.22430324**, and no other simple aromatic ester in the dataset contradicts this trend, I predict that the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is also very low.

### Predicted property value: **-8.22430324**  
*(Same as ethyl benzoate due to structural similarity and consistent trend for simple aromatic esters.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be **0.0** for molecules that are simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, or aromatic hydrocarbons) without any functional groups or heteroatoms (e.g., halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc.). 

The molecule in question, **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), is a simple hydrocarbon with only carbon-carbon double bonds and no other functional groups or heteroatoms. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.0**  

This aligns with examples like:  
- CC/C=C/C (0.0)  
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (0.0)  
- CCCc1ccccc1 (0.0)  
- C1CCCC1 (0.0)  

All of these are hydrocarbons without functional groups, and their property values are consistently 0.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe several patterns in the property values:

1. **Halogenated alkanes** (especially fully substituted ones like C(Cl)(Cl)Cl or FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br) consistently have a property value of **0.0** when they contain no other functional groups. This suggests that symmetric or heavily halogenated alkanes default to zero.

2. The molecule **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated methane analog (bromoform), structurally similar to other fully halogenated compounds like C(Cl)(Cl)Cl and FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br in the dataset, which both have a property value of 0.0.

3. The property only deviates from 0.0 when there are additional functional groups (e.g., polar groups like -OH, -NO2, -C=O, or unsaturation) or asymmetric substitutions.

Since **BrC(Br)Br** is a symmetric, fully halogenated alkane with no other functional groups, it fits the pattern of molecules with a property value of **0.0**.

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 0.0**

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.15025328245877984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C, C1CCC=CC1, Cc1ccc(C)cc1)**: Typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain polar or functional groups.
2. **Halogenated compounds (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)**: Usually **0.0** unless combined with other functional groups.
3. **Polar or complex functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, sulfonamides, heterocycles)**: Tend to deviate from **0.0**, with values ranging from positive to negative depending on the specific arrangement.
   - Example: **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.93657973** due to the thiophosphate, amide, and aromatic chloro groups.
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** and **C=CC#N** have strongly negative values (**-2.9847036**) due to the nitrile group.
4. **Combination of aromatic rings, carbonyls, and heteroatoms**: Often results in intermediate values (e.g., **0.24719399** to **1.04173861**).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The structure **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** contains:
1. A **thiophosphate group (P(=S)(OCC))**, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)...** in the example with value **-0.93657973**.
2. A **chloroalkyl group (C(CCl))**, which is moderately polar.
3. A **lactam-like structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)** with an aromatic ring and two carbonyls, contributing polarity and potential negative impact.
4. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP)**, which are somewhat polar but not as strongly as nitriles or sulfonamides.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (**-0.93657973**), which also has a thiophosphate, amide, and chloroaromatic group. The given molecule has additional complexity (lactam, ethoxy), but the thiophosphate and chloroalkyl groups dominate the property.
- The lactam/aromatic carbonyl system may slightly offset the negativity (e.g., **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** has **+0.53829662**), but the thiophosphate and chloroalkyl likely pull the value down.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the thiophosphate and chloroalkyl groups (similar to the **-0.93657973** example) and the moderating influence of the lactam/aromatic carbonyl, the predicted value is likely slightly less negative but still in the same range. 

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, considering structural similarities and trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that it is a physicochemical or bioactivity-related parameter where thiophosphates and chloroalkyl groups contribute negatively, while carbonyl/aromatic systems may partially counteract.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.9129361842896787
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide-like group**: `CN(C)C(=O)N` (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` in the examples, which has a value of **-2.86764415**).
   - **Chlorinated aromatic ring**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (chlorinated aromatics like `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` have values around **-0.55820091**).
   - **Heterocyclic group**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` (similar to nitro or other electron-withdrawing heterocycles, which can contribute to negative values).
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` (steric bulk often reduces polarity, but its effect here is secondary to the polar groups).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule has a **polar amide-like linkage** (`C(=O)N`) and a **chlorinated aromatic system**, both of which are present in other molecules with negative property values.
   - The presence of **multiple polar and electron-withdrawing groups** (Cl, C=O, N) suggests a significant negative contribution.
   - The closest analog in the examples is `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` with a value of **-2.86764415**, but this molecule has additional polar/electron-withdrawing features (Cl, heterocycle) that may further lower the value.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with `C(=O)N` and polar groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C`) have strongly negative values.
   - Chlorinated aromatics alone (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have moderately negative values (~ -0.558).
   - Combining these features suggests a cumulative effect, likely more negative than `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` but not as extreme as highly polar molecules like `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (-5.924).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (-2.867) but with additional polar/electron-withdrawing groups, the predicted value is slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -3.1**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -2.6586222681842813
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, let's analyze the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** to predict its property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives with Cl Substituents**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -1.85787415  
     (This is a dichlorophenol.)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -1.85787415  
     (This is a tetrachlorophenol.)
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = -5.92406254  
     (This is an aniline with a Cl substituent, which seems to have a much lower value, likely due to the amine group.)

2. **Symmetry and Multiple Cl Substituents**:
   - The presence of multiple Cl atoms on aromatic rings tends to give a property value of **-1.85787415**, as seen in the dichlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol examples.

3. **Ether Linkage (Oc1ccc1Oc2ccc2)**:
   - The molecule has an ether linkage (O) connecting two chlorinated phenol rings. From the examples, ether linkages do not seem to drastically change the property value if the core structure (chlorinated phenol) is preserved.

4. **No Nitrogen or Other Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule does not contain nitrogen or other functional groups (like nitro, carbonyl, etc.) that would significantly alter the property value from the chlorophenol trend.

### Structure of the Given Molecule:
The molecule is a **dichlorinated diphenyl ether** with the structure:
- Two phenol rings connected by an ether linkage (O).
- One ring has two Cl substituents (positions 2 and 5), and the other ring has one Cl substituent (position 3).

This is structurally similar to the dichlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol examples, where the property value was consistently **-1.85787415**.

### Prediction:
Since the molecule is a chlorinated phenol derivative with no additional functional groups that would significantly alter the property (based on the examples), the predicted property value is:

**-1.85787415**
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule `CC/C=C\C` (which is a trans-2-butene structure) is very similar to `CC/C=C/C` (also a butene isomer, likely cis-2-butene or another butene form), which has a property value of **0.0**. 

Additionally, other simple hydrocarbons like `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C` (hexamethylbenzene), `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (tetracosane), and `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) also have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that the property is likely **0.0** for simple, non-polar hydrocarbons without functional groups or significant electronic perturbations.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.5468783295589141
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. Simple alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and unsubstituted hydrocarbons (e.g., CC#C, C, C1CCCCCC1) typically have a property value of 0.0.

2. Ethers (C-O-C) with simple alkyl groups tend to have a property value of 0.0 unless they have additional functional groups or complex structures that modify the property.

3. The molecule CCCOCC is diethyl ether (CH3CH2OCH2CH3), which is a simple ether with no additional functional groups or complex structural features.

4. Comparing with similar simple ethers or hydrocarbons in the examples (e.g., CC#C, C1CCCCCC1, CC(C)Cl), which all have 0.0), we can infer that CCCOCC should also have a property value of 0.0.

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is: 0.0.

Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.8478662089432434
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCO`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO`) tend to have a property value of **-1.85787415**.
   - Shorter aliphatic chains or simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `C`, `CCCCCC`, `CC=CC=O`) often have a value of **0.0** or **-1.32581932**.

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Molecules with unsubstituted or minimally substituted aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Aromatic rings with polar or bulky substituents (e.g., `Nc1cccc2ccccc12`) can have very negative values (e.g., **-5.92406254**) or other values depending on the substituents.

3. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) often increase the property value (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has **1.04384445**).
   - Carbonyl groups (`C=O`) can lead to values like **-1.32581932** (e.g., `CC=CC=O`).
   - Amides (`C(=O)N`) and sulfonamides (`NS(=O)(=O)`) can lead to positive or intermediate values (e.g., **0.16637378** for `CCCC1C(=O)N3N(C1=O)c2cc(C)ccc2N=C3N(C)C`).

4. **Bulky or Complex Structures**:
   - Molecules with multiple rings or complex scaffolds (e.g., steroids or fused rings) can have varied values, but often intermediate (e.g., **0.72342543** for `CCC(C)C(=O)OC2CC(C)C=C3C=CC(C)C(CCC1CC(O)CC(=O)O1)C23`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**:
- It contains **two aromatic rings** (one substituted with a bulky tert-butyl group via an amide linkage, the other attached to a dimethylamide group).
- The structure is **bulky and hydrophobic** due to the tert-butyl group and aromatic rings.
- The **amide group (`C(=O)N`)** and **tertiary amine (`N(C)C`)** introduce some polarity but are offset by the hydrophobic aromatic and aliphatic parts.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a value of **-0.61247134**. This is somewhat similar (aromatic rings + amide), but the target molecule has a more bulky tert-butyl group.
2. `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two aromatic rings linked by an aliphatic chain) has a value of **0.0**, but the target has additional polar groups.
3. `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (fused aromatic rings with an amine) has **-5.92406254**, but this is an outlier due to the amine's strong effect.

### Prediction:
Given the bulky hydrophobic tert-butyl group, two aromatic rings, and the amide/tertiary amine polarity, the property value is likely **intermediate**, similar to other amide-containing aromatic compounds. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.6**  
(Close to `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` at **-0.61247134**, but slightly less negative due to the tert-butyl group's hydrophobicity offsetting polarity). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.6** (approximate; likely between -0.5 and -0.7 based on structural analogs).

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -2.8093902041282726
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Aromatics**: 
   - Molecules like `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C`, `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, and `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` have a property value of **0.0**. These are either purely hydrocarbon-based or halogen-substituted aromatics without polar or functional groups that significantly alter the property.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with **alcohols (`-OH`)** or **ethers (`-O-`)** often have a property value of **-1.85787415** (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C`, `CO`, `CCC(C)O`, `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C`).
   - Molecules with **carbonyl groups (`C=O`)** or **nitro groups (`NO2`)** tend to have negative values (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` has -0.55820091, `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` has -1.09445415).

3. **Amides and Complex Heterocycles**:
   - Amides (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has -1.84786621) often have negative values.
   - Heterocycles with nitrogen or oxygen (e.g., `c2ccc1scnc1c2` has -0.85242191) also tend to have negative values.

4. **Brominated Aromatics**:
   - Simple brominated aromatics like `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` have **0.0**, but when combined with polar groups (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`), the value becomes **-1.85787415**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**
- This molecule is an **amide (`CC(=O)N-`)** derivative of a brominated aromatic (`c1ccc(Br)cc1`).
- The presence of the amide group (`-CONH-`) is a strong polar functional group, similar to other amides in the dataset that have negative values (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has -1.84786621).
- The bromine substitution on the aromatic ring alone would suggest **0.0**, but the amide group dominates the property value.

### Closest Analogues:
- `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of **-1.84786621** (amide + aromatic).
- `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of **-1.85787415** (phenol + bromine).

Given that the amide group is less polar than a phenol but still significant, the value should be slightly less negative than `-1.85787415` but more negative than `-1.84786621`.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-1.85** (approximating to the nearest observed trend for amides + aromatics).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-1.84786621**.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkyl chains or alkanes** (e.g., CCCC, CC1CCCCC1) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups.
2. **Aromatic rings without polar substituents** (e.g., Cc1ccccc1, C=Cc1ccccc1, c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24) also have a property value of **0.0**.
3. **Branched alkyl groups attached to aromatic rings** (e.g., CCc1ccc(C)cc1, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1) consistently have a property value of **0.0**.
4. **Functional groups like -OH, -NO2, -C=O, -N, etc.** introduce non-zero property values (often negative or positive depending on the group).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** consists of:
- A branched alkyl group (**CC(C)C**-) attached to a benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**).
- No polar or functional groups are present; it is purely hydrocarbon-based (alkyl + aromatic).

### Matching Examples:
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** → Property = 0.0 (alkyl-aromatic, no polar groups).
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** → Property = 0.0 (branched alkyl-aromatic, no polar groups).
- **Cc1ccccc1** → Property = -5.92406254 (but this has an -NH2 group, which is polar and explains the non-zero value).
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** → Property = 0.0 (alkene + aromatic, no polar groups).

### Conclusion:
Since **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is a branched alkyl-aromatic hydrocarbon with no polar or functional groups, its property value is **0.0**, consistent with similar molecules in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Aldehydes/Ketones**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (a heterocyclic ketone) has a value of **-0.37662776**.
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid ketone) has a value of **-0.54110894**.
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (an aliphatic ketone) has a value of **-1.32581932**.
   - Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) is structurally simpler than these but shares the aromatic carbonyl motif.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Polar Groups**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (an aromatic amide with a hydroxyl group) has a value of **0.43495944**.
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (a nitro-phenol) has a value of **0.43666213**.
   - Benzaldehyde lacks additional polar groups like -OH or -NO2, so its value should be lower than these.

3. **Simple Aromatics Without Polar Groups**:
   - **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12** (a naphthalene derivative) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (a polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **0.0**.
   - Benzaldehyde has a polar carbonyl group, so its value should not be zero.

4. **Aldehydes vs. Ketones**:
   - Aldehydes are typically slightly more polar than ketones due to the presence of a hydrogen bond donor (aldehyde proton). However, in this dataset, the aliphatic ketone (**CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1**) has a more negative value than the heterocyclic ketone, suggesting the aromaticity may play a role in reducing the magnitude of the property.

### Prediction for Benzaldehyde:
- Benzaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Compared to the heterocyclic ketone (**Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1**, **-0.37662776**), it lacks the heterocyclic nitrogen but has a similar carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring.
- The property value is likely slightly more negative than the heterocyclic ketone due to the absence of heteroatom effects but less negative than the aliphatic ketone (**-1.32581932**) because of aromatic stabilization.
- A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **-0.45**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value may vary depending on the specific property being measured, which is not explicitly stated in the question.)

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 1.5803443331619844
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two amide groups (`N-C=O`), one of which is part of a cyclic structure (imidazolidine-2,4-dione-like core).
   - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to an aromatic ring.
   - An aromatic heterocycle (furan-like ring with `O` and `N` involvement).
   - Conjugated system with `N=C` and aromaticity.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may decrease the property value.
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may also decrease the property value.
   - The conjugated system might add some complexity, but the net effect is likely dominated by the nitro and amide groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) have property values close to zero or slightly negative (-0.00733143).
   - Molecules with multiple polar/amide groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) have more negative values (-1.84786621).
   - The presence of the furan-like ring (similar to `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`) suggests a moderately negative value (-0.3605312).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- A nitro group (tends toward slightly negative values).
- Two amide groups (tends toward more negative values).
- A conjugated heterocycle (moderate effect),

The property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is **-0.68149257**, similar to molecules with nitro and amide groups in the examples (e.g., `CN(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has -0.68149257).

### Final Answer:
**-0.68149257**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -3.1308293571629506
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, which has a property value of **-3.58100994**. 

The only difference between the two molecules is the presence of a double bond (=N) in the second case, while the first has a single bond (N). However, the electronic and steric environments are very similar, and the property is likely dominated by the two phenyl rings and the nitrogen linker. 

Given this similarity, I predict the property for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** to be close to that of **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but slightly less negative due to the absence of the double bond (which may slightly reduce electron delocalization effects). 

**Predicted property value: ~ -3.2**  

(Note: If the property is highly sensitive to the double bond, the value could be closer to -3.5, but based on the examples, single/double bond variations in similar structures do not always cause drastic changes. For instance, compare **Nc1ccccc1** (-5.92406254) with **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (-5.92406254), where extended conjugation doesn't change the value.)  

However, since **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is the closest analog, I would lean toward a value near **-3.5**.  

**Final predicted value: -3.5** (approximate).  

(If the property is a computed parameter like dipole moment or logP, the exact value may vary, but this is the best estimate given the examples.)

**Answer: -3.5** (estimated based on closest analog).

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.7879179583692381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC(=O)**) and a cyclic structure with a **cyclopentane (CCCC1)** core. 
   - It resembles a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, similar to succinimide derivatives.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.78791796): This is a cyclic diamide with additional alkyl substitutions. The presence of the cyclic diamide core is similar to our target molecule, but our molecule has a simpler cyclopentane ring and no extra alkyl branches.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not explicitly listed, but similar to simpler imides): Such structures tend to have moderate positive property values when polar groups like NO₂ are absent.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.36921282): This is a cyclic urea/amide hybrid, which is somewhat analogous but less rigid than our target.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, CF₃) that would increase the property value (as seen in high-value examples like 1.72781918 for trinitrobenzene).
   - It also lacks long hydrophobic chains or highly nonpolar groups that would drive the value toward zero or negative.
   - The cyclic diamide structure suggests moderate polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, likely placing it in the mid-to-low positive range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to cyclic diamides/imide-like molecules in the examples (which cluster around **0.2–0.8**), and the absence of extreme substituents, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.55**  

This balances the contributions of the polar amide groups and the neutral cyclopentane ring.  

(Note: Without explicit training data or a defined property, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples' trends.)

**Final Answer**: **0.55**

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br, I) aromatic systems** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups are present. Examples:
   - Clc1ccccc1Cl: 0.0  
   - Ic1ccccc1: 0.0  
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: 0.0  

2. The presence of **NO₂, SO₂, or other polar groups** tends to increase the property value (e.g., nitro groups often give values > 0.5).  

3. **Simple hydrocarbons or halogenated aliphatics** also tend to have a value of 0.0 unless they contain other functional groups (e.g., C=O, OH, etc.).  

### Target Molecule: **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**
- This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with three chlorine atoms on two aromatic rings.  
- No other functional groups (e.g., NO₂, SO₂, C=O, NH, etc.) are present.  
- Similar to other **fully halogenated aromatics** in the examples, which all have a property value of **0.0**.  

### Prediction:
The property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is **0.0**.  

### Reasoning:
- The molecule is purely a **chlorinated aromatic system** with no additional polar or ionizable groups.  
- All analogous examples (e.g., Clc1ccccc1Cl, Clc1ccc(cc1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) have a value of 0.0.  
- Thus, the predicted value is consistent with the trend observed in the given data.  

**Final Answer: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aromatic hydrocarbons without polar substituents (e.g., CCCCcc1ccccc1) tend to have property values around 0.0
2. Alkyl-substituted benzenes (e.g., Cc1ccccc1N) show negative values, with more complex substitutions leading to more negative values
3. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a dialkyl-substituted benzene (ethylbenzene derivative) with symmetrical substitution

Comparing with similar structures:
- CCCCcc1ccccc1 (butylbenzene) has a value of 0.0
- Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline) has -5.924 (but this has a polar NH2 group)
- CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) has -0.852

The closest analog is butylbenzene (0.0), and our molecule is even simpler with just ethyl groups. There are no polar groups or complex functionalities that would drive the value significantly negative or positive.

Therefore, the most reasonable prediction for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is:

0.0

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0417386056350728
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO₂)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.11024056, 1.04384445, 0.61976207). The presence of multiple nitro groups often increases the value further.
   - Example: `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has a value of 1.04384445.

2. **Sulfonamide Groups (S(=O)(=O)N)**:
   - The molecule `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` contains a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O), which is somewhat analogous to a nitro group in terms of electron-withdrawing character and polarity. 
   - Sulfonamides are polar and can contribute to higher property values, though not as strongly as nitro groups.

3. **Aromatic Amines (N attached to benzene)**:
   - Aromatic amines (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have moderate positive values (0.61976207 in this case). The sulfonamide group in the target molecule is likely to have a similar or slightly stronger effect than a nitro group in this context.

4. **Neutral or Zero Values**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons or non-polar groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1`, `ClCBr`) have a value of 0.0.
   - Polar or functionalized molecules tend to deviate from 0.0.

### Prediction for `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O`:
- The molecule has an aromatic amine (`Nc1ccc(cc1)`) and a sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`), both of which are polar and likely to contribute positively to the property value.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 0.61976207.
  - The sulfonamide group is slightly more polar than a nitro group, so we might expect a higher value than 0.61976207 but not as high as molecules with multiple nitro groups (e.g., 1.04384445).

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction for `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` is **~0.75**, considering the sulfonamide's contribution is slightly stronger than a single nitro group but not as strong as multiple nitro groups.

### Final Answer:
**0.75** (approximate, based on analogous examples)

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a structure similar to other PAHs in the dataset (e.g., `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`, `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`), we observe that all such PAHs in the examples have a property value of **0.0**. 

This suggests that the property being predicted is likely related to some form of polarity, dipole moment, or electronic effect, where fully conjugated, symmetric, or non-polar aromatic systems (like unsubstituted PAHs) consistently yield a value of 0.0. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.4217935089384213
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the molecular structure of the given compound, I can predict the property value by considering the following observations:

1. **Presence of multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups**: The molecule has several -OH groups, which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. In the examples, molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.47014769). This suggests that -OH groups contribute positively to the property.

2. **Aromatic rings and conjugated systems**: The molecule contains aromatic rings and conjugated carbonyl (C=O) groups, which can influence the property. In the examples, aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`) have negative or moderate values, but the presence of -OH seems to counteract this.

3. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - The molecule resembles `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` (property = -0.35989159), but with more -OH groups and no halogens. The additional -OH groups would likely increase the property value.
   - It also resembles `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (property = -0.77654681), but with a larger, more complex structure and additional -OH groups. The larger size and extra -OH groups would likely push the value higher.

4. **No halogens or nonpolar groups**: The absence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) or large nonpolar alkyl chains (which often correspond to property = 0.0) suggests the value will not be zero.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the molecule's property value is likely **positive and moderate**, similar to other polyhydroxy aromatic compounds in the examples. A reasonable prediction is:

**0.547058**  
(This matches the value for `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4`, which has a similar structure with multiple -OH groups and aromatic systems.)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.1313266759425282
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, Cc1cccc(C)c1, CC=C(C)C, CCCI)**: These have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that purely hydrocarbon structures (no polar or functional groups) default to 0.0.
   
2. **Polar or Functionalized Molecules**:
   - **Esters (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC, CCCC(=O)OC)**: These have a value of **-8.22430324**, indicating that ester groups (R-COO-R') strongly contribute to a negative property value.
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CCC(O)CC, CCCC(C)(C)O, Cc1ccc(O)cc1)**: These consistently have a value of **-1.85787415**, suggesting that hydroxyl groups (-OH) contribute this value.
   - **Nitro Groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O)**: These have a value of **-0.55820091**, while dinitro (e.g., Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O) has **1.04384445**, indicating non-additive effects.
   - **Phosphates (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: These have negative values (e.g., **-3.67631365**), suggesting phosphate/sulfur groups contribute negatively.
   - **Amides (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1)**: These have small positive values (e.g., **0.15621638**).
   - **Heterocycles (e.g., Nc1nccs1, c2ccc1scnc1c2)**: These have negative values (e.g., **-0.92252444**, **-0.85242191**).

3. **Combined Functional Groups**:
   - When multiple functional groups are present, the property values seem to combine non-linearly (e.g., **CCC(O)CC** is **-1.85787415**, same as other alcohols, but **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** is also **-1.85787415**, suggesting the Cl and OH effects may not simply add).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**. Breaking it down:
1. **COP(=O)(X)SC**: This is a phosphate group (P=O) with mixed O and S substituents. From examples:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: **-3.67631365** (phosphate with S and Cl).
   - **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: **-0.44246481** (phosphate with O and Cl).
   - The presence of S (thio) seems to make the value more negative.

2. **NC(C)=O**: This is an acetamide group (N-C=O). From examples:
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**: **0.15621638** (amide).
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: **-2.8093902** (amide + Cl, but the value is more negative due to Cl).

3. **SC**: This is a thiolate or sulfide group. From examples:
   - Thiol/sulfur groups (e.g., **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1**) have negative values (**-0.37662776**).

### Prediction:
The molecule combines:
- A phosphate group (likely contributing **~-0.4 to -3.6**, depending on substituents).
- An acetamide group (contributing **~0.15** if isolated, but may interact).
- A sulfur group (contributing **~-0.37**).

Given the complexity, the value is likely between **-1.0 and -3.0**. A reasonable estimate is **-2.62742941**, as this value appears in a similarly complex molecule (**CCCCOCN(C(=O)CCl)c1c(CC)cccc1CC**).

### Final Answer:
**-2.62742941**

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I can make the following observations to predict its property value:

1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Alkanes**: 
   - Molecules like **CC1CCCC1**, **CCCC(C)C**, and **CCBr** have a property value of **0.0**. These are simple hydrocarbons or halogen-substituted alkanes with no significant polar or functional groups.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl) also has a value of **0.0**, suggesting that even with multiple halogens, if the molecule is symmetric and non-polar, the value remains **0.0**.

2. **Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-C=O**, **-N=O**, **-F**, **-NH2**) tend to have non-zero values, either positive or negative, depending on the specific group and context.
   - For example, **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (an aromatic amine) has a very negative value (**-5.92406254**), while **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (a polar heterocycle) has a positive value (**0.91550088**).

3. **Alkenes and Halogenated Alkenes**:
   - The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a simple halogenated alkene. It is symmetric and has no additional polar functional groups beyond the Cl substituents.
   - Comparing to similar cases like **CCCC(=C)C** (a simple alkene) or **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a symmetric halogenated aromatic), these have a value of **0.0**.

4. **Symmetry and Polarity**:
   - The trans-configuration of **Cl\C=C/Cl** (assuming trans-dichloroethene) is symmetric, and the dipole moment cancels out, making the molecule non-polar overall. This is similar to the cases above where symmetric, non-polar molecules have a value of **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
Given the symmetry and lack of additional polar functional groups, **Cl\C=C/Cl** is predicted to have a property value of **0.0**.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.8524219144999955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons/halogenated hydrocarbons** (e.g., CCCCCCCBr, ClCC(C)C, BrC(Cl)Cl, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl) have a property value of **0.0**. These lack polar or functional groups that might influence the property.
2. **Molecules with hydroxyl (-OH) or carbonyl (C=O) groups** tend to have negative values (e.g., CC(C)(C)CCO: -1.85787415, CCCC(=O)CCC: -1.32581932).
3. **Aromatic systems without polar groups** (e.g., Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43) also have **0.0**.
4. **Heteroaromatics** (e.g., COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C: 0.43154715, COc2ncc1nccnc1n2: 0.34566089) have small positive or negative values depending on substituents.
5. **Pyridine derivatives** are not explicitly listed, but **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused polycyclic heteroaromatic) has a very negative value (-5.05136163), likely due to its complex structure.

### Prediction for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine):
- Pyridine is a simple heteroaromatic with no polar substituents (just the nitrogen in the ring). 
- It is analogous to benzene (which would likely have a value of 0.0 if listed), but the nitrogen introduces slight polarity. 
- However, the nitrogen's lone pair is not as strongly polarizing as an -OH or C=O group, and no examples of unsubstituted pyridine are given. 
- Given that most simple aromatic/heteroaromatic systems without strong polar groups default to **0.0**, and no clear evidence suggests pyridine would deviate significantly, the safest prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.1526412903508167
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., esters, alcohols, amines, halogens, and nitro groups). Let's analyze the target molecule step-by-step:

### Target Molecule:  
**OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**  

#### Key Structural Features:  
1. **Polar/Protic Groups**:  
   - Two hydroxyl groups (**OCC(O)C**): These contribute positively (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO → 1.625).  
   - An ester (**COC(=O)**): Esters like CCOC(=O)CC → -8.224, but here it's conjugated with an aromatic ring, which may reduce the negative impact.  
   - Aniline-like nitrogen (**Nc2ccnc3**): Aromatic amines (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 → -0.009).  

2. **Aromatic Systems**:  
   - Benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**) and fused heteroaromatic system (**c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**): Aromaticity alone often gives ~0, but substitution matters.  

3. **Halogen (Cl)**:  
   - Chlorine on aromatic ring (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1 → 0, but ClCC#N → -2.985). Here, it's aromatic, so less negative.  

4. **Combined Effects**:  
   - The hydroxyl groups (+ contribution) and ester (- contribution) may partially cancel out.  
   - The aromatic amine and chloro-substituted heterocycle likely contribute modestly (near 0 or slightly negative).  

#### Analogous Examples:  
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (highly polar, +1.625) vs. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** (diester, +0.003).  
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ester + aromatic amine, -0.009).  

#### Prediction:  
The hydroxyl groups dominate, but the ester and aromatic Cl/NH reduce the positive effect. The net property is likely slightly positive, similar to molecules with mixed polar/nonpolar features (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC → 0.003**).  

### Final Predicted Property Value:  
**0.190** (close to CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 → 0.190, which has ester + aromatic + ether).

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional groups. Let's analyze the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) in the context of the given data:

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1`, `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1`, `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`) have a property value of **0.0**, suggesting minimal contribution to the property.
2. **Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH)** often have negative property values, especially if they are aliphatic alcohols (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` and `OC1CCCCCCC1` both have **-1.85787415**).
3. **Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., -OH, -NH, -COOH) tend to decrease the property value, while conjugated or aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing/donating groups can increase or decrease it depending on the context.

### Analysis of **CCCCCO**:
- It is a linear aliphatic alcohol (1-pentanol) with a terminal -OH group.
- Similar aliphatic alcohols in the examples (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` and `OC1CCCCCCC1`) have a property value of **-1.85787415**.
- The property value seems consistent for aliphatic -OH groups regardless of chain length or branching (as long as no other functional groups are present).

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCO**:
Based on the pattern, the predicted property value is:  
**-1.85787415**  

This matches the trend observed for other simple aliphatic alcohols in the dataset.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.7136250493237667
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules, such as the presence of polar functional groups, aromatic systems, halogens, and other substituents. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1`

### Structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with property values around 0.0 unless other strong functional groups are present.
2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Seen in examples like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` (-2.8093902) and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (0.78791796). The property value varies depending on other substituents.
3. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Not directly present in the examples, but sulfonyl groups are polar and could contribute to a negative or positive shift depending on context.
4. **Heterocycle (CCO1 with S and O)**: The fused heterocycle with sulfur and oxygen may contribute to polarity or electronic effects.
5. **Methyl group (CC1)**: Neutral contributor unless adjacent to strongly polar groups.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (two aromatic rings with amino groups): -0.02339478 (close to 0.0).
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (cyclic amide with alkyl groups): 0.78791796.
- `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` (amide with aromatic and halogen): -2.8093902.
- `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (cyclic amide with aromatic rings): 0.24719399.

The given molecule has an amide group attached to an aromatic ring and a sulfonyl group in a heterocycle. The sulfonyl group is likely to increase polarity, but the aromatic ring and alkyl group may balance this. The closest analog is `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (0.24719399), but the sulfonyl group here may push the value slightly more negative.

### Predicted property value:
Given the balance of polar (amide, sulfonyl) and non-polar (aromatic, alkyl) groups, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **-0.3 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3270703**  
(Similar to `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2` which has polar and aromatic features). 

However, if the sulfonyl group dominates, it could be closer to **-0.5**. Given the examples, **-0.3270703** seems plausible. 

Final answer: **-0.3270703**

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 1.4303437753072703
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property based on structural features that correlate with the property values in the training set. Here's my reasoning:

Key observations from the training data:
1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have moderately negative values around -0.55 to -0.85, unless balanced by other features.
2. Aromatic systems alone typically give 0.0 unless modified by specific functional groups.
3. Esters (COC=O) show varying effects, with some giving very negative values (like -8.22) when simple, but less impact when part of complex structures.
4. The presence of both aromatic nitro and ester groups in complex structures tends to result in values around -0.5 to -1.0.

The target molecule has:
- A nitro group attached to an aromatic ring
- Two ester groups (COC=O)
- A complex fused ring system with aromatic and non-aromatic portions
- An enamine-type structure (C=CN)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- The nitro-aromatic + ester combination is somewhat similar to "CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2" which had -0.98
- The complexity is comparable to some steroid-like structures that had values around -1.0 to -1.5

Given these features and comparisons, I would predict the property value to be in the range of -0.8 to -1.2. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.98180028**

This matches well with similar complex structures containing both nitro and ester groups in the training set.

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.7879179583692381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a small, rigid heterocycle with polar amide functionalities.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which often influences the property value in the given dataset (e.g., negative values for polar/hydrogen-bonding molecules like alcohols or amides).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1** (pyridine, property = -0.852): Aromatic nitrogen heterocycle with moderate polarity.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine-like, property = +0.916): Polar, hydrogen-bonding heterocycle with positive value.
   - **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (sugar-like, property = +1.123): Highly polar, polyhydroxy structure with positive value.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like, property = -0.541): Moderate polarity with carbonyl groups.

   The given molecule is more polar than simple hydrocarbons (property = 0.0) but less polar than highly functionalized molecules like sugars. Its rigid cyclic diamide structure suggests moderate polarity, likely closer to heterocycles like pyridine or imides.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - Cyclic amides/imides in the dataset (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**, property = 0.378) have small positive or near-zero values.
   - The absence of aromaticity (unlike pyridine) and the presence of a strained cyclopropane ring may slightly reduce the polarity compared to aromatic amides.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between polarity (amide groups) and rigidity (cyclopropane), the property value is likely **small and positive**, similar to other cyclic amides in the dataset. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.4** (approximate, based on analogous structures). 

For higher precision, note that the closest analog in the dataset is **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 0.378), which shares the cyclic imide motif. Thus, the predicted value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is:  
**0.38** (matching the imide example). 

However, since the cyclopropane ring may slightly reduce polarity compared to the aromatic analog, a conservative estimate is:  
**0.3**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.3** (approximated based on structural similarity to cyclic imides in the dataset).

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC, C1CC=CC1, CCC1CCCCC1)** consistently have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups or heteroatoms that significantly influence the property.

2. **Halogenated simple hydrocarbons (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)** also have a property value of **0.0**, suggesting that simple halogen substitution (e.g., Cl, Br, I) on aromatic or aliphatic systems does not significantly alter the property unless combined with other functional groups.

3. **Molecules with more complex functional groups (e.g., C=O, S=O, N, O, etc.)** deviate from 0.0, with the magnitude and sign of the property value depending on the specific functional groups and their arrangement.

The molecule in question is **ClCC**, which is a simple chloroalkane (chloroethane). It consists of a two-carbon chain with a chlorine substituent and no other functional groups. 

Based on the examples:
- **CCCC** (butane) has a property value of 0.0.
- **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a property value of 0.0.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of 0.0.

Since **ClCC** is a simple halogenated alkane with no additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be **0.0**, consistent with the trend observed for similar molecules.

### Predicted property value for ClCC: **0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.8524219144999955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly negative values (e.g., ~ -1.8 to -5.9)**:
   - Often associated with aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., hydroxyl groups, nitro groups, or heteroatoms in rings).
   - Example: `Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` → -1.85787415 (phenol-like structure).
   - Example: `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` → -5.97757958 (heteroaromatic with N and O).

2. **Values around 0.0**:
   - Typically seen in non-polar or symmetrically halogenated molecules (e.g., `ClC1(C2(Cl)...` → 0.0, `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2` → 0.0).
   - Also in simple alkanes or symmetric polyhalogenated compounds.

3. **Positive values (e.g., ~0.5 to 2.0)**:
   - Often associated with complex polar functionalities (e.g., multiple nitro groups, sulfonamides, or polyols).
   - Example: `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` → 1.62534774 (polyol).
   - Example: `CN(=O)=O` → -0.55820091 (nitro group, but less negative than aromatic nitro).

4. **Chlorinated aromatics**:
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → 0.0 (symmetrical, non-polar).
   - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.55820091 (asymmetric with nitro group).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**:
- Aromatic ring with a nitrogen heteroatom (pyridine-like).
- Chlorine substituents on the ring and a CCl3 group.
- Asymmetric and polar due to the N heteroatom and CCl3.

#### Similar Examples:
- `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.55820091 (chlorinated aromatic with nitro).
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → 0.0 (chlorinated but symmetric).
- `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` → -5.97757958 (heteroaromatic with N and O, very negative).

The presence of the N heteroatom and CCl3 group suggests some polarity, but the lack of strong electron-withdrawing groups (like NO2) or hydroxyls may not push the value as negative as -5.9. The closest analog is likely the chlorinated aromatic with a nitro group (-0.558), but since this lacks a nitro, it might be slightly less negative or closer to 0.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the asymmetry, heteroatom, and CCl3 group, the value is likely **between -1.0 and 0.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**-0.55820091** (similar to other moderately polar chlorinated aromatics with heteroatoms). 

However, since the N in the ring is less polarizing than a nitro group, it might be slightly less negative. A refined guess is:

**-0.4 to -0.6**. 

Given the examples, the closest match is **-0.55820091**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.55820091**

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic carbon chain tends to be **-1.85787415**. This is consistently observed in the following examples:

- **CCCC(O)CCC** → -1.85787415  
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1** → -1.85787415  
- **CCC(C)CCO** → -1.85787415  
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** → -1.85787415 (though aromatic, the -OH dominates)  
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** → -1.85787415  

The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic chain (hexanol derivative), which matches the structural pattern of the above examples. 

### Predicted property value:  
**-1.85787415**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to be **0.0** for molecules that are either:  
1. Simple halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`, `ClCCl`), or  
2. Symmetrical or non-polar structures without strongly functionalized groups (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`).  

The molecule `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1` (1,4-dibromobenzene) fits this pattern:  
- It is a simple, symmetrical dihalogenated aromatic compound.  
- No additional functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, sulfonyl) are present to perturb the property value from zero.  

**Predicted property value: 0.0**  

This aligns with the trend seen in similar molecules like `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl`, which also have a value of 0.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Fully halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules are highly symmetrical and lack polar or functional groups that would contribute to the property in question.

2. The molecule in question, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl`, is another example of a **fully halogenated aromatic compound** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure). It is symmetrical and lacks any polar or functional groups other than the chlorine atoms.

3. Other molecules with **no polar or ionizable groups** (e.g., simple hydrocarbons like `CCCCCCCC=C` or fully halogenated aliphatics like `ClC(Br)Br`) also have a property value of **0.0**.

Thus, based on the consistent trend for fully halogenated aromatic systems, the predicted property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` is:

**0.0**

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.44246480966066754
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and steric effects. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl groups and one central phenyl group).
2. **Phosphate ester linkage (OP(=O)(OAr)(OAr))**: Highly polar and likely contributes significantly to the property value.
3. **Methyl substituents**: Non-polar groups that may slightly offset the polarity.
4. **Bulky substituents**: The phosphate group is sterically hindered by the two aromatic rings, which may influence the property.

### Observations from the examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitriles, phosphates) tend to have non-zero property values.
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, NO₂, OH) often have negative or positive values depending on the nature of the group.
- Phosphate-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`) have values of **0.15025328** and **-1.53289284**, respectively, suggesting phosphates can lead to moderate or negative values.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings with polar linkages (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1`) gives a value of **-1.84786621**.

### Prediction:
This molecule has a **phosphate group bridging two aromatic rings**, which is highly polar but also sterically bulky. The examples suggest such structures often have **negative property values in the range of -1.5 to -2.0**. Given the similarity to `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` (value = -1.84786621), which also has polar/aromatic features, a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -1.53289284**  
*(This aligns with the phosphate-containing examples and the steric/electronic influence of the aromatic systems.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -1.8747377211086393
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the aromatic ring. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.5846022). CF3 is strongly electron-withdrawing and may contribute to higher values.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The aromatic ring has a CF3 and is connected to a heterocyclic moiety. Similar structures (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`) have values around 0.91550088.
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle**: The `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` moiety contains two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Chlorinated aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) often have values of 0.0, but when combined with polar groups (like the ketone here), the value may increase.
4. **Polarity and hydrogen bonding**: The ketone and amine in the heterocycle introduce polarity, which may elevate the property value (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` has 0.91550088).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (CF3-like electronegativity + heterocycle) = 1.5846022  
- `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (polar heterocycle) = 0.91550088  
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (aromatic + polar groups) = -0.02339478  

Given the strong electron-withdrawing CF3, polar ketone, and chlorinated heterocycle, the property value is likely **positive and moderate**. A reasonable estimate is between **0.8 and 1.2**.

### Predicted value:
**1.0488842**  
*(This matches the value of `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)(C)C#N)n1`, which has similar electronegative and polar features.)*  

Thus, the predicted property value for **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** is:  
**1.0488842**
==================================================
Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.007331432915424354
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can identify patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

1. **Aromatic rings with simple substituents** (e.g., `Cc1ccncc1C`, `c1ccccc1O`) tend to have property values around **-0.85 to -1.86** unless polar or charged groups are present.
2. **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** significantly increase the property value when attached to aromatic rings (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has **1.04**, and `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` has **1.43**).
3. **Ethers (`O` or `OC`)** slightly reduce the property value when attached to aromatics (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has **0.0037**, and `c1ccccc1O` has **-1.86**).

The molecule in question is **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, which contains:
- A methoxy group (`COc`) attached to an aromatic ring (slightly reducing effect).
- A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to the same aromatic ring (strongly increasing effect).

From the examples:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups) has **1.04**.
- `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` (one nitro + other polar groups) has **1.43**.
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (no nitro but two esters) has **0.0037**.

Given that the nitro group dominates but the methoxy slightly counteracts its effect, the property value should be **lower than 1.04 but still positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

*(This is based on interpolation between the examples with nitro groups and those with ethers, leaning toward the nitro group's stronger influence.)*

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, symmetry, and halogenation. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and symmetric, with the formula **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**. 

From the examples, we observe:
1. Highly halogenated (especially chlorine-containing) symmetric molecules like **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** and **ClCCCl** have a property value of **0.0**.
2. Less symmetric or polar halogenated molecules (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**) have negative values.
3. The presence of strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, or sulfonyl) tends to push the value positive or negative depending on the context.

This molecule is **fully chlorinated and symmetric**, similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**, which has a value of **0.0**. There are no strongly polar or ionizable groups to shift the value away from neutrality.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics without polar groups)**:
   - Examples: `C1CCCCCC1`, `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23`, `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1`, `CCCCCc1ccccc1`
   - Property value: **0.0**
   - These molecules lack polar or functional groups and are hydrophobic.

2. **Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, I, F) but no other polar groups**:
   - Examples: `Clc1ccccc1I`, `Clc1ccccc1Cl`, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`
   - Property value: **0.0**
   - Halogens alone (without additional polar groups like OH, NO₂, etc.) do not seem to affect the property.

3. **Molecules with polar groups (OH, NO₂, C=O, NH, etc.)**:
   - These typically have non-zero property values, often negative or positive depending on the group's nature and context.
   - Example: `CC#N` (acetonitrile) has a strongly negative value (**-2.9847036**), likely due to the highly polar nitrile group.
   - Example: `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (phenethyl alcohol) has a value of **-1.85787415**, attributed to the OH group.

4. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` has a value of **-0.00975218**.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` has a value of **0.19017514**.
   - Esters tend to have small-magnitude values (close to zero), as they are moderately polar but not as strongly as alcohols or nitriles.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate):
- This is an ester (formate ester) with the structure: HCOOCH₂CH₂CH₃.
- Esters in the examples have property values close to zero (either slightly negative or positive).
- The formate group (HCOO-) is slightly more polar than larger esters, but the propyl group is nonpolar.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present.

### Predicted Property:
Given the ester functionality and comparison to similar molecules, the predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely close to zero, with a slight negative trend due to the polar C=O group. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.2** (approximate, based on ester examples).  

However, looking at the closest example (`CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` with **-0.00975218**), the absence of an aromatic amine in **CCCOC=O** might make it even less polar. Thus, a value closer to zero is plausible.  

Given the data, the safest prediction is:  
**0.0** (since simpler esters without additional polar groups tend to align with zero in the examples).  

But if we consider the formate's polarity, a slight negative value like **-0.1** could also be justified.  

Given the uncertainty, I would lean toward:  
**-0.1** as a compromise.  

However, the most conservative answer (aligning with the majority of simple esters in the data) is:  
**0.0**.  

### Final Answer:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here's how I analyze the given molecule and predict its property:

### Molecule: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**  
This is a fatty acid ester with a long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) and an ethyl ester group (**OCC**). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon chains (e.g., CCCCCCc1ccccc1, CC, C=CCC=C)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they have polar or functional groups that significantly alter the property.
2. **Esters (e.g., COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C, CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C)**: These often have values around **0.15 to 0.6**, depending on additional functional groups.
3. **Simple esters without aromatic or polar groups (e.g., CCOC)**: These tend to have values closer to **-0.54687833** (as seen with CCOc1ccccc1 and CCCOC).

### Prediction:
The given molecule is a simple aliphatic ester (**CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**) with no additional polar or aromatic features. Based on the examples:
- Long hydrocarbon chains alone tend to give **0.0**.
- Simple esters like **CCOC** give **-0.54687833**.
- The presence of the long hydrocarbon chain may dominate, but the ester group introduces slight polarity.

Given the lack of strong polar/aromatic features, the value is likely **closer to 0.0** but slightly negative due to the ester. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.54687833**  
(Similar to other simple esters like CCOc1ccccc1 and CCCOC in the examples). 

However, if the long hydrocarbon chain dominates, it could also be **0.0**. Given the examples, I lean toward the ester influence and predict:

**Final answer: -0.54687833**

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.1678001720384605
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.54687833) but with additional substitutions.
   - Phenolic groups in the examples tend to contribute negative values (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** = -1.85787415).

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.68149257).
   - Amides often moderate the property value (neither strongly positive nor negative).

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.55820091).
   - Nitro groups tend to contribute slightly negative values.

4. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**:
   - Chlorine substitutions alone (e.g., **ClCC(Cl)Cl**) contribute 0.0, but when combined with polar groups, they can enhance polarity.

5. **Aromatic systems**:
   - Simple aromatics (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) contribute 0.0, but substitutions alter this.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.68149257) is structurally similar but lacks the nitro group. The nitro group here is likely to make the property more negative.
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.55820091) has a nitro group and chlorine but lacks the phenol and amide. The combined effect of these groups in the target molecule suggests a more negative value than -0.558 but not as extreme as -1.857.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of the phenol (-0.546), amide (-0.681), and nitro (-0.558) groups, the property is likely in the range of **-0.7 to -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: -0.85**  

This aligns with the trend where multiple polar/electron-withdrawing groups (phenol, amide, nitro) combine to produce a moderately negative value. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.85**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.1304595989855115
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `c1ccccc1`), halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`), and molecules with no polar or functional groups that significantly alter the property.
   - Symmetrical or non-polar structures (e.g., `CBr`, `CCSSCC`).

2. **Property ≈ -1.85787415**: 
   - Molecules with hydroxyl (`-OH`) or ether (`-O-`) groups in aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C`, `CCCO`, `CCC(O)CC`).
   - Some halogenated phenols (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`).

3. **Property ≈ -2.62742941 to -2.8093902**: 
   - Molecules with amide (`-CON-`) or sulfonamide (`-SO2N-`) groups combined with aromatic rings (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1`, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`).

4. **Property ≈ 0.78791796**: 
   - Cyclic ureas or imides (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1`).

5. **Other values**: 
   - Depend on specific combinations of polar groups, conjugation, or heterocycles (e.g., `COc1ncnc2nccnc12` ≈ 0.34566089).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** has:
- Two **phosphorothioate groups (`P(=S)(OC)OC`)** linked to aromatic rings via ether (`-O-`) bridges.
- A **thioether (`-S-`) linkage** between two benzene rings.
- No strongly polar groups like `-OH`, `-CONH`, or `-SO2NH`.

### Key Features:
1. The **phosphorothioate groups** are bulky and polar but are symmetrically distributed and neutral (no net charge).
2. The **thioether linkage** is non-polar.
3. The structure is symmetrical and lacks strongly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (like `-OH` or `-CONH`).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **symmetrical, non-polar, or weakly polar aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Cc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`) have **property = 0.0**.
- The phosphorothioate groups here are analogous to neutral, bulky substituents (like halogens or alkyl groups) in the examples.

### Conclusion:
The molecule's symmetry, lack of strong polar groups, and resemblance to other examples with **property = 0.0** suggest that its predicted property value is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.43666213387638636
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a nitrophenol (specifically, 2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol, but the exact position isn't specified in the SMILES). 
   - Similar molecules in the examples:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a hydroxybenzamide) has a property value of **0.43495944**.
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (a nitrotoluene) has a property value of **-0.55820091**.
     - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** (a chloroaniline) has a property value of **-5.92406254** (this is an outlier due to the strong electron-withdrawing Cl and NH2 group).

2. **Electron-withdrawing groups (NO2 and OH)**:
   - The NO2 group is strongly electron-withdrawing, while the OH group is electron-donating. This push-pull effect can influence the property value.
   - In **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**, which has a NO2 and O-ether, the value is **-0.00733143**.

3. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (NO2, OH, etc.) tend to have property values between **-1.0 to +1.0**, unless there are additional strong effects (e.g., the highly negative value for **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**).

4. **Comparison to nitrotoluene**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.55820091**. Replacing the methyl group with a hydroxyl (OH) would likely make the property less negative because OH is less electron-donating than CH3 in this context.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the nitrophenol **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is expected to have a property value **between -0.5 and 0.0**, closer to the nitrotoluene example but slightly less negative due to the OH group. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (similar to the nitrotoluene but adjusted for the OH effect).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **-0.34970157** (matching the second example's value, as the structural features are similar). 

However, if we consider the nitrophenol's unique push-pull effect, a more precise estimate might be **-0.25**. But based on the given examples, the closest match is **-0.34970157**. 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-0.34970157**

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 2.8067967037509134
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some observed trends:

1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics without polar groups)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24`).
2. **Highly halogenated aromatics (e.g., Cl, Br)**: These also tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1`).
3. **Nitriles (C#N)**: These often have strongly negative values (e.g., `CCC#N` and `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N` both have **-2.9847036**).
4. **Oxygen-rich molecules (e.g., polyols, sugars)**: These tend to have **positive values** (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has **1.12275518**).
5. **Molecules with amides, esters, or other polar functional groups**: These can have either positive or negative values depending on the context (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has **0.78791796**, while `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has **-0.61247134**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
```
This is a **complex sugar-like molecule** with multiple hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups and ether (`-O-`) linkages. It resembles a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide structure, which is highly oxygenated and polar.

### Prediction:
Given the trend that **oxygen-rich molecules (especially sugars)** tend to have **positive property values**, and comparing to similar examples:
- `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple sugar) has a value of **1.12275518**.
- Other polyols or sugar-like molecules in the dataset also have positive values.

The target molecule is even more oxygenated and larger, suggesting a **higher positive value** than the simple sugar example. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.21203054** (similar to the other highly oxygenated molecule `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` in the dataset, which also has a value of **1.21203054**). 

Thus, the predicted property value for the given molecule is:  
**1.21203054**.
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here's a breakdown of the patterns observed:

1. **Hydrocarbons with no functional groups or halogens**: 
   - Examples: `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1`, `Fc1cccc(F)c1`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`, `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32`, `CCCCCCCCC=C`, `ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl)Cl`
   - Property value: **0.0** (these are simple hydrocarbons or fully halogenated hydrocarbons with no polar or reactive functional groups).

2. **Alkynes (C≡C)**:
   - Example: `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (contains two C≡N groups, not pure alkyne, but similar in terms of unsaturation).
   - Property value: **-0.26328849** (slightly negative, but this molecule also has aromatic rings and nitriles).
   - Pure alkyne hydrocarbons (like `CCC#C`) are not explicitly in the examples, but based on the trend for simple hydrocarbons, they likely have a value close to **0.0**.

3. **Functional groups affecting the property**:
   - Polar or reactive groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N, -Cl, etc.) tend to give non-zero values.
   - Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics without polar groups) tend to have **0.0**.

### Prediction for `CCC#C` (1-butyne):
This is a simple alkyne hydrocarbon with no polar or reactive functional groups. Based on the examples, such molecules (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC=C`, `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32`) have a property value of **0.0**.

### Final answer:
The predicted property value for `CCC#C` is **0.0**.

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -1.532892838228519
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`), I can make the following observations to predict the property:

### Key Patterns in the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCC`, `CCCC=C`, `CCCCCC#C`)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0**, unless they contain functional groups or heteroatoms.
2. **Chlorinated Aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`, `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`)**: These also tend to have a property value of **0.0**, unless combined with other functional groups (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` has a value of `-2.65862227` due to the presence of hydroxyl groups).
3. **Phosphorothioate/Sulfur-Containing Groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`)**: These often have negative values (e.g., `-0.93657973` in this case), especially when combined with chlorinated aromatics.
4. **Ether/Alkoxy Groups (e.g., `CCCCOCCCC`)**: These tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., `-0.54687833`).
5. **Combination of Phosphorothioate + Chlorinated Aromatic + Ether**: The molecule in question has all three:
   - A phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)`),
   - A chlorinated aromatic ring (`c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`),
   - An ethoxy group (`CCO`).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of `-0.93657973`. This is a phosphorothioate with a chlorinated aromatic and an ester group.
- `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has a value of `0.67449076`, but this is a more complex diester with two phosphorothioate groups.
- `Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of `-0.00733143`, which is a chlorinated aromatic with a nitro and ether group.

Given that the molecule in question is less complex than `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` but still has a phosphorothioate + chlorinated aromatic + ether, I would expect a moderately negative value, similar to but slightly less negative than `-0.93657973`.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable prediction for `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` would be **`-0.75`**. This accounts for:
- The phosphorothioate group's contribution (negative),
- The chlorinated aromatic's neutral tendency (unless modified by other groups),
- The ethoxy group's slight negative contribution.

(Note: The exact value is likely between `-0.5` and `-1.0`, and `-0.75` is a balanced estimate based on the examples.)

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.5854465158978687
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `C=C`, `CC(C)C`, `CCCCBr`) and halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl`, `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`) tend to have a property value of 0.0**. These molecules lack strong polar or functional groups that might influence the property.
2. **Molecules with polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Nc1cccc2ccccc12`) often have negative property values (e.g., -5.92406254)**. These include amines (`N`), amides (`C(=O)N`), or hydroxyl groups (`O`).
3. **Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or sulfonamides (`S(=O)(=O)N`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.95426605 for `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)S(N)(=O)=O)N(=O)=O`)**.
4. **Molecules with carbonyl groups (`C=O`) or esters (`COC=O`) can have varying property values, often negative or near zero, depending on the context**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`
- The molecule is a pyridine derivative (`c1nccc...c1`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide group: carbonyl attached to a hydrazine).
- The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, similar to amides or amines in the examples.
- The presence of the pyridine ring (aromatic nitrogen) may further enhance polarity.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (aniline derivative) has a property value of -5.92406254.
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (naphthylamine) also has -5.92406254.
- `C=CCS(=O)SCC=C` (a disulfide derivative) has -1.32581932.
- The hydrazide group here is even more polar than a simple amine, so we might expect a moderately negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability of the hydrazide group, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to other polar nitrogen-containing compounds in the examples. A reasonable estimate would be between -1.0 and -2.0, but closer to the more negative values due to the pyridine ring's additional influence.

**Predicted property value: -1.84786621**  
(This matches the value for `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, which also has a polar amide group and aromatic system, making it a plausible analog.)

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.93657972845172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Zero Property (0.0):**
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CC1=CCCCC1**, **CCCCCCCI**, **CCc1ccccc1**).
   - Halogenated hydrocarbons without polar or functional groups (e.g., **BrCBr**, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl**).
   - Aromatic systems without strongly polar substituents (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24**).

2. **Negative Property Values:**
   - Molecules with polar functional groups like **amide (N-C=O)**, **ester (COOR)**, **nitro (NO2)**, or **hydroxyl (OH)** tend to have negative values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** with **-2.86764415**, **Oc1ccncc1** with **-1.69541248**).
   - Phosphorothioate groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) can contribute to negative or positive values depending on other substituents.

3. **Positive Property Values:**
   - Molecules with multiple nitro groups (e.g., **Cc1ccc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** with **1.04384445**) or polyhydroxy groups (e.g., **OC1C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** with **1.62534774**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**

Key features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCCC))**: Present in one example (**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) with a property of **0.66799051**, but this also has a nitro group which increases the value.
2. **Amide group (SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C)**: Amides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) tend to give strongly negative values (e.g., **-2.86764415**).
3. **Alkyl chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These alone do not contribute significantly (property = 0.0 unless combined with polar groups).

### Prediction:
The presence of the **amide group** (strongly negative contribution) and the **phosphorothioate group** (moderate contribution, likely negative here due to lack of nitro) suggests the property will be **negative**. 

Comparing to similar molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (two amides) has **-2.86764415**.
- **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (amide + thioether) has **-2.62742941**.
- The phosphorothioate may slightly offset the amide's negativity, but the value should still be strongly negative.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is:  
**-2.5** (approximate, likely between -2.0 and -3.0 based on the examples).  

For specificity, I would estimate:  
**-2.62742941** (similar to **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**, as both have an amide and a sulfur-containing group).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-2.62742941**

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H atoms) with no functional groups or rings** tend to have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `ClCCBr` (halogenated but simple chain) → 0.0
   - `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclic hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `CCCC/C=C/C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclic hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `c1ccsc1` (thiophene, aromatic but no polar groups) → 0.0

2. **Functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -Cl, -Br, -CO, etc.)** introduce non-zero property values, often negative or positive depending on the group's nature and position.

3. **Long aliphatic chains without functional groups** (e.g., `CCCCCCCO` or `CCC(C)C`) have property values of **0.0** if no functional groups are present.

The molecule in question is **`CCCCCCCC`** (octane), which is a simple linear hydrocarbon with no functional groups or rings. Based on the examples, this should have a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: **0.0**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.22042066951630573
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**: 
   - Molecules with steroid-like frameworks (e.g., **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., **1.21203054**).
   - The presence of **ketone (=O)** and **hydroxyl (-OH)** groups in polycyclic systems often increases the property value.

2. **Simple Hydrocarbons**: 
   - Molecules like **C1CCCCCCC1** or **CCC1CCCCC1** have a property value of **0.0**, indicating no contribution from simple aliphatic rings or chains.

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Carbonyl groups (=O)** and **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** often increase the property value (e.g., **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCCC1)C(=O)N2** has **0.78791796**).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br, F)** or **nitro groups (NO2)** can reduce or have mixed effects depending on context.

4. **Conjugated Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings or conjugated systems with polar substituents (e.g., **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** has **-0.56194736**) may lower the value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with:
- A **ketone (=O)** at position 2 of the second ring.
- Two **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** at positions 1 and 4.
- A **terminal alkyne (C#C)** group.

Comparing to similar examples:
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** has a value of **1.21203054** (steroid with ketone, hydroxyl, and fluorinated groups).
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** has a value of **-1.09445415** (steroid with ketone and hydroxyl, but less polar than the first example).

The target molecule is most similar to these steroid examples but lacks highly polar groups like **fluorine** or **ester**. The **terminal alkyne (C#C)** is relatively non-polar but may slightly increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** but with fewer polar groups, the value should be **slightly lower** than **1.21203054** but still positive. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.85** (approximate, based on the examples).  

However, looking at the exact matches for steroid-like molecules with ketone and hydroxyl groups, the value often clusters around **0.78791796** (seen in multiple examples). Thus, the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.78791796**  

This aligns with the recurring value for similar polycyclic ketone-alcohol structures in the provided data.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.063492820681407
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some observed trends:

1. **Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0**, unless they have significant polar or functional group substitutions.

2. **Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-NH`, `-COOH`, `-NO₂`, `-SO₂`)**: These tend to increase the property value (positive values) or decrease it (negative values), depending on their nature and position. For example:
   - Phenols (`Oc1ccccc1Cl`) often have values around **-1.85787415**.
   - Amides (`C(=O)N`) or nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) often lead to positive values (e.g., **0.78791796**, **1.04384445**).

3. **Halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F, I)**: These often result in **0.0** unless combined with other polar groups.

4. **Complex heterocycles or fused rings with polar groups**: These can have moderately positive or negative values depending on the balance of hydrophobicity and polarity.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Key features:
- Multiple methoxy (`OCH₃`) and hydroxyl (`OH`) groups → Likely negative contribution.
- A ketone (`C=O`) → Moderate positive contribution.
- Fused ring systems with aromatic and aliphatic regions → Neutral unless polar groups dominate.
- Presence of an **OCO** (dioxolane-like) group → May slightly increase the value.

Given the prevalence of polar groups (especially multiple `OCH₃` and `OH`), the molecule is likely to have a **negative property value**, similar to other polyhydroxy/methoxy-substituted compounds in the examples (e.g., **-1.85787415** for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` or **-0.54687833** for `COc1ccccc1Cl`). However, the ketone and complex ring system may offset this slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate, based on the closest structural analogs, is:  
**-0.94468212** (similar to the steroidal polyol example in the dataset).  

This accounts for the balance of polar groups (`OH`, `OCH₃`, `C=O`) and the overall molecular complexity.  

**Final answer: -0.94468212**

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (4-nitrophenol): **0.43666213**
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (2-nitrophenol): **0.43666213**
   - These two phenol derivatives with nitro groups (-NO2) have the same property value, suggesting that the position of the nitro group does not significantly affect the property in this case.

2. **Chlorinated Phenols**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (4-iodochlorobenzene): **0.0**
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl): **0.0**
   - Chlorinated aromatic compounds without additional polar groups (like -OH or -NO2) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Phenol vs. Chlorophenol**:
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in phenol derivatives seems to increase the property value compared to non-hydroxylated chlorinated aromatics (which are **0.0**).
   - However, the hydroxyl group's effect is modulated by other substituents (e.g., nitro groups increase the value more than halogens).

4. **Direct Comparison**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol) is structurally similar to **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (4-nitrophenol), but with a less electron-withdrawing -Cl substituent instead of -NO2.
   - Since -Cl is less polar and less electron-withdrawing than -NO2, we expect the property value for 4-chlorophenol to be **lower than 0.43666213 but higher than 0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **~0.2**. However, looking at the examples more closely:
- The nitro group contributes **~0.436**, while halogens alone contribute **0.0**.
- The hydroxyl group likely contributes a base value, and the -Cl substituent slightly modifies it.

A more precise estimate based on the examples is **0.0**, as the hydroxyl and chlorine effects may cancel out (similar to how **Clc1ccccc1I** is **0.0**). However, this seems counterintuitive because phenol derivatives with -NO2 are higher.

Alternatively, if we consider that the hydroxyl group alone (without other substituents) might have a base value, and -Cl slightly reduces it, the value could be **~0.2**. But none of the examples directly support this.

Given the uncertainty, the safest prediction based on the closest examples is:  
**0.0** (similar to other halogenated aromatics). 

However, this contradicts the phenol-like examples. A better estimate is to average the effect:
- Phenol (no substituent): not in examples, but likely >0.
- Chlorobenzene: 0.0.
- Thus, 4-chlorophenol might be halfway, e.g., **~0.2**.

But since no phenol (without other substituents) is given, and the nitrophenols are **0.436**, the value for 4-chlorophenol is likely **lower than 0.436 but >0.0**.

Given the lack of exact matches, the most plausible value based on the examples is:  
**0.0** (as halogens seem to dominate over -OH in these examples). 

### Final Answer:

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.9818002844177209
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Present in many molecules with property = 0 (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`).
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property = -1.87473772) and `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (property = -2.8093902), where the presence of an amide tends to lower the property value.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to simple alkyl/alkyne chains (e.g., `CCCC`, `CCCCI`), which typically contribute 0 unless paired with polar groups.
   - **Ether (O)**: Seen in `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 0.00374462), where it has minimal impact.
   - **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Often associated with property = 0 when symmetrically substituted (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`).

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog is likely `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property = -1.87473772), which has an amide and halogenated aromatic ring. However, this molecule has more electronegative fluorine atoms and a more complex structure.
   - Simpler amides like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` have property = -2.8093902, but this lacks the alkyne and ether.
   - The presence of the alkyne and ether might slightly offset the negative contribution of the amide, pulling the value closer to -1.0 to -2.0.

3. **Polarity and Symmetry**:
   - The molecule is polar due to the amide and Cl substituents, but the alkyne and ether reduce the overall polarity compared to pure amides. Symmetry is low, so cancellation effects are minimal.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value is likely **between -1.0 and -2.0**, closer to **-1.5** due to the balance of the amide (strongly negative) and the alkyne/ether (neutralizing slightly). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.32581932** (similar to `CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1` or `CCCCSP(=O)(SCCCC)SCCCC`, which have mixed polar/nonpolar features).

### Final Answer:

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.3598915865804391
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Central oxygen (O) attached to a carbon with three substituents**: 
   - One substituent is a **chlorinated phenyl ring (c1ccc(Cl)cc1)**.
   - Another is a **pyrimidine-like ring (c2cncnc2)** (resembling a heterocycle with nitrogen).
   - The third is another **chlorinated phenyl ring (c3ccccc3Cl)**.

2. **Presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (N, Cl, O)**: 
   - The molecule has significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding (due to the O and N atoms).
   - The chlorine atoms add electron-withdrawing effects.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine-like, property = -0.7737): This has two phenyl rings attached to N, but no heterocycles or Cl. The property is moderately negative.
- **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** (catechol, property = -0.7765): This has two OH groups on a phenyl ring, showing negative property due to H-bonding.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (dichlorobenzene, property = 0.0): Fully halogenated, non-polar, property is zero.
- **Nc1nc[nH]n1** (tetrazole-like, property = 0.5727): Polar heterocycle with N, positive property.
- **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (polar cyclic structure, property = -0.3497): Negative due to carbonyls and N.

### Observations:
- The given molecule combines **polar heterocycles (c2cncnc2)**, **chlorinated phenyl rings**, and a **central oxygen**. 
- The presence of **Cl** and **N** suggests some polarity, but the central O with bulky substituents may reduce overall polarity compared to simpler polar molecules.
- The closest analog might be **O=C1N(COC(=O)C)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (property = 0.7992), which has a polar core with aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar (O, N, Cl) and non-polar (aromatic rings) features, the property is likely **moderately positive**. 

### Final predicted property:
**0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with polar cores and aromatic substituents).

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCCOC=O**, let's break down the structural features that seem to influence the property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes/alkyl halides/fully saturated hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCCBr`, `CCI`, `C1CCCCCCC1`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they have polar or functional groups.
2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** often contribute negatively to the property value, especially in aldehydes (`CCCCCC=O` → -1.32581932) or ketones (`CCCCCCCCC(=O)C` → -1.32581932).
3. **Ethers (C-O-C)** without other polar groups may not significantly affect the property (e.g., `CCCOC` is not explicitly given, but similar simple ethers likely have values near 0.0 unless combined with other features).
4. **Combination of ether + carbonyl**: The molecule `CC(=O)OCC` has a value of **-8.22430324**, but this is an ester (R-COO-R'), which is more polar than a simple ether + aldehyde. This suggests esters have a strong negative contribution.

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O**:
- The structure is **butyl formate** (an ester: `R-COO-R'`, where `R = propyl` and `R' = H`). 
- Esters in the examples (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC` → -8.22430324) have highly negative values, likely due to the polar carbonyl + ether linkage.
- The formate group (`H-COO-R`) is even more polar than acetate (`CH3-COO-R`), so we might expect a slightly more negative value than -8.22430324.

However, the given examples also show that:
- Smaller esters (like `CC(=O)OCC`) have very negative values, while larger esters might be less extreme (but no direct examples are provided).
- The butyl chain (`CCCC`) is nonpolar and may slightly offset the polarity of the ester group.

### Prediction:
Given the strong negative contribution of esters in the examples and the formate group's polarity, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCOC=O** would be close to the value of `CC(=O)OCC` (-8.22430324), but slightly less negative due to the longer alkyl chain. 

**Predicted property value: -7.5** (approximate, considering the trend). 

(Note: Without a more extensive dataset or explicit examples of formates, this is an educated extrapolation based on the provided examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with simple halogenated alkanes (such as **ClCCCl** and **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) is consistently **0.0**. This suggests that the presence of halogens (Cl, Br) in small, non-polar, or symmetrically substituted structures tends to result in a property value of **0.0**.

For the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane analog, though simplified here as a dichlorinated single carbon), the structure is even simpler than **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) and lacks additional functional groups or complexity that might contribute to a non-zero property value in the given dataset. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - Molecules with a phenol group (`OH` attached to a benzene ring) often have property values around **-0.77654681** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` and `c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2`).
   - If the phenol is further substituted with alkyl groups (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`), the value tends to become more negative (e.g., **-1.85787415**), suggesting that alkyl substitution increases the magnitude of the property.

2. **Methyl-Substituted Phenol**:
   - The molecule in question, **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, is a dimethyl-substituted phenol (two methyl groups on the benzene ring with an `OH` group). 
   - Comparing this to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (a tert-butyl and methyl-substituted phenol with value **-1.85787415**), the substitution pattern is similar but less bulky. 

3. **Trend**:
   - The presence of alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, etc.) on the phenol ring tends to push the property value more negative, with bulkier groups having a stronger effect.
   - Since **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has two methyl groups (less bulky than tert-butyl), its value should be less negative than **-1.85787415** but more negative than the unsubstituted phenol (**-0.77654681**).

### Closest Analogues:
- `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` → **-1.85787415** (bulky alkyl substitution)
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` → **-0.77654681** (no alkyl substitution)
- `Cc1ccc(C)cc1O` (hypothetical monomethyl phenol, not in the examples) would likely be intermediate.

### Prediction:
Given the two methyl groups in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, the property value should be closer to **-1.85787415** but slightly less negative due to less steric bulk. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.85787415**  
*(This matches the value for `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`, as the additional methyl substitution likely has a similar effect to the tert-butyl group in this context.)* 

### Final Answer:
**-1.85787415**
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to be **0.0** for molecules that are highly halogenated (especially with chlorine or bromine) and/or have symmetric, aromatic structures without polar or strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings. It is symmetric and lacks strongly polar or ionizable functional groups (e.g., no nitro, carbonyl, hydroxy, or amino groups).  

Several similar examples from the given data support this prediction:  
- **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **0.0**  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** → **0.0**  
- **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** → **0.0**  

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C

Examples supporting this pattern:
- `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) → 0.0  
- `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (alkyl-substituted benzene) → 0.0  
- `CCCCCCCCC=C` (alkene) → 0.0  
- `CCCCCCCC` (alkane) → 0.0  

The molecule `CC=C(C)C` (isobutene) is a simple alkene with no polar or functional groups. Thus, its predicted property value is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain patterns in the property values associated with different molecular structures. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC(C)C, CCC(C)C(C)C, C=CCCC=C, c1ccc2c3c(ccc2c1)c4cccc5cccc3c45)** tend to have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups or halogens.

2. **Molecules with halogens (Cl, F, Br, I) or other functional groups (e.g., OH, O, NO2, etc.)** often have non-zero property values, typically negative or positive depending on the specific substituents and their arrangement.

3. **Highly chlorinated or fluorinated molecules** (e.g., Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless paired with other functional groups (e.g., OH, NO2, etc.).

4. **Small chlorinated molecules** like **ClCCl** (dichloromethane-like structure) are not explicitly in the examples, but similar small halogenated molecules (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl) have a property value of **0.0**.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
The molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is a simple dihalogenated hydrocarbon with no additional functional groups. Based on the examples, small halogenated molecules like this tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** can be predicted by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is very similar but with a slightly different chlorine substitution pattern) has a property value of **-1.85787415**.
2. Another highly chlorinated aromatic compound, **OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, also has the same value (**-1.85787415**).
3. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and an oxygen (hydroxyl or ether) seems to correlate strongly with this value in the given dataset.

### Conclusion:
The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is structurally very similar to the examples above, differing only in the position of one chlorine substituent. Since the property value appears consistent for such heavily chlorinated aromatic systems with oxygen, the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: -1.85787415**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.063492820681407
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. Here's the reasoning for the prediction:

1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**: The presence of multiple polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, ether `-O-`, carbonyl `C=O`) tends to increase the property value (e.g., sugars like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` have high values like 2.307). Conversely, nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCC(C)C`, `CCCCCCCC...`) have a value of 0.0.

2. **Molecular Complexity**: Larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., steroids, heterocycles) often have intermediate to high values (e.g., 1.212 for `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`).

3. **Aromatic Systems**: Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., nitro `-NO2`, hydroxyl `-OH`) can have positive or negative values depending on the substituents (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has 0.436, while `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.558).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is highly complex with:
- Multiple ether (`-O-`) and hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups.
- Aromatic rings with methoxy (`-OCH3`) substituents.
- A fused polycyclic system with sugar-like moieties (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`).
- No strongly nonpolar or halogen-dominated regions.

Given the prevalence of polar oxygen-containing groups and structural similarity to high-value examples (e.g., sugars, polycyclic systems with polar groups), the property value is likely **positive and relatively large**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the closest analogs (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` = 2.307, `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` = 1.212), the predicted value for this molecule is:

**1.69344575**  
*(This matches the value of `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O`, which has similar polar heterocycles and sugar-like moieties.)*

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7494595971918068
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C`, I can predict the property value based on structural similarities and functional groups present in the molecule.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Thiol/Thioether Groups (S-containing):**
   - `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` has a value of **-2.62742941**.
   - `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` has a value of **-2.8093902**.
   - Thiol/thioether groups tend to contribute to negative values, especially when combined with polar groups.

2. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Rings (e.g., imidazole, triazole):**
   - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a value of **0.69490311**.
   - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` has a value of **0.69434824**.
   - These structures often have moderately positive values when combined with polar substituents.

3. **Tert-Butyl Groups (`C(C)(C)C`):**
   - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **0.63148265**.
   - The tert-butyl group alone doesn’t dominate the property but may slightly increase it.

4. **Amide/Carbonyl Groups (`C(=O)N`):**
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` has a value of **0.43495944**.
   - Amides tend to contribute to positive values, especially when adjacent to aromatic or heterocyclic systems.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` has:
- A **thioether group (`CS-`)**, which typically contributes to negative values.
- A **triazole-like heterocycle (`nnc`) with a carbonyl (`C=O`) and amide (`N`)**, which tends to increase the value.
- A **tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`)**, which may slightly increase the value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (value = **0.63148265**), which shares the tert-butyl group and a heterocycle with sulfur. However, the target molecule has a thioether instead of a thione and lacks the hydroxyl group, which may reduce the value slightly.
- The thioether group’s negative contribution (as seen in other examples) may offset some of the positive contributions from the heterocycle and amide.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the negative contribution of the thioether and the positive contributions of the heterocycle/amide, the predicted value is likely in the range of **0.6 to 0.7**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.65** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples).  

For precision, I would predict:  
**0.63148265** (same as the closest analog, `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C`, due to strong structural similarity).  

However, since the thioether in the target molecule is less polar than the thione in the analog, the value might be slightly lower. Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**0.63**.  

### Final Answer:
**0.63** (approximate).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends from the given examples. The value is likely a computed or measured physicochemical property such as solubility, partition coefficient, or reactivity index.)

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional groups. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is ethyl benzoate, which consists of:
1. An ethyl ester group (`CCOC(=O)`) – polar and capable of weak hydrogen bonding (accepting).
2. A phenyl ring (`c1ccccc1`) – aromatic and hydrophobic.

**Observations from the examples:**
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12`, `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`) have a property value of **0.0** unless they have strongly polar substituents.
- Molecules with ester groups (`CCOC(=O)OC`, `CCCC(=O)OCC`) have negative values (e.g., **-8.22430324**), but these are aliphatic esters with no aromatic stabilization.
- Aromatic esters or similar structures (e.g., `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) have a value of **-0.54687833**, suggesting a moderate negative contribution from the ester + aromatic system.

**Prediction:**  
The ester group introduces polarity, but the aromatic ring counterbalances it. The property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as aliphatic esters. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.55** (similar to diphenyl ether, which also combines an aromatic system with a polar linker).

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is:  
**-0.55** (approximate, based on analogous examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. **Halogenated Alkanes/Alkenes/Aromatics**: 
   - Simple halogenated compounds (e.g., `CSSC`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `CI`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups are present.
   - The molecule `CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O` has a value of **0.10770407**, but this is likely due to the presence of other functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, amide).

2. **Simple Alkyl Bromides**:
   - The molecule `CI` (iodomethane-like) has a value of **0.0**, suggesting that simple alkyl halides without other functional groups default to **0.0**.
   - `CCCCCCCBr` is a simple linear alkyl bromide (heptyl bromide) with no other functional groups, analogous to `CI` or `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (brominated aromatic with no other groups).

3. **Long Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - `CCCCCCCC=C` (octene) has a value of **0.0**, indicating that long hydrocarbon chains without polar/functional groups default to **0.0**.
   - `CCCCCCCBr` is similar but with a terminal bromine, which does not seem to significantly alter the property based on the examples.

### Conclusion:
Since `CCCCCCCBr` is a simple alkyl bromide with no other functional groups, its property value is most likely **0.0**, consistent with similar molecules in the dataset.

**Predicted property value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC, CC1=CCCCC1, C=Cc1ccccc1, CCBr, Cc1ccccc1, c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32, CCC(C)(C)CC, CC#C, ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, etc.)** consistently have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically non-polar, unfunctionalized molecules.

2. **Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, etc.)** tend to have negative or positive property values depending on their complexity and other substituents. For example:
   - **CCCCOC=O** (an aldehyde) has a value of **-8.22430324**.
   - **OC1CCCCCC1** (a cyclohexanol) has a value of **-1.85787415**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** (a complex cyclic urea) has a value of **0.78791796**.

3. **Molecules with nitrogen-containing functional groups (e.g., nitro, amides, nitriles, etc.)** tend to have positive property values. For example:
   - **NC(N)=NC#N** (a guanidine-like structure) has a value of **1.08340637**.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (a sulfonamide) has a value of **1.04173861**.

4. **Molecules with multiple functional groups or aromatic systems with polar substituents** can have higher positive or negative values depending on the balance of polar/non-polar character.

### Prediction for **CO** (methanol):
- **CO** is a simple alcohol, similar to **CCC(C)CO** (isobutanol, value = -1.85787415) or **OC1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexanol, value = -1.85787415). 
- However, it is even simpler (just methanol), so its property value is likely less negative than these larger alcohols but still negative.
- From the examples, the smallest oxygen-containing molecule is **CCCCOC=O** (butyraldehyde, value = -8.22430324), but this is an aldehyde, which may have a more extreme value.
- Methanol is a small, polar molecule but lacks the complexity of the other examples. Given the trend, its value is likely **closer to 0** but still negative.

### Final Prediction:
Given the simplicity of methanol (CO) and the lack of exact matches in the examples, the most reasonable estimate is:  
**Property value for CO = -1.85787415** (same as other simple alcohols in the dataset, like OC1CCCCCC1 or CCC(C)CO).  

This aligns with the observed trend that simple alcohols have this value in the provided data.  

**Answer: -1.85787415**
