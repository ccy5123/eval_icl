SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.04991592522472173
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Hydrocarbon chains (alkanes)**: Generally have negative values, becoming less negative with increasing length or branching (e.g., `CC=C` = -0.914, `CCCCCC` = -0.745, `CC(C)C` = -0.861).

2. **Functional groups**:
   - **Esters (`COC=O` or similar)**: Tend to have values around -0.4 to -0.6 (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cccnc1` = -0.434, `CCOC(=O)CC` = -0.663).
   - **Long-chain esters with more carbons**: Values become less negative or slightly positive (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` = 0.448 in the examples).

3. **Aromatic systems with polar groups**: Often have positive values, especially with halogens or multiple functional groups.

4. **Highly halogenated or complex structures**: Very high positive values (e.g., Cl-rich molecules like `Clc1c(Cl)...` = 24.699).

### Target Molecule: `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`
- This is a **long-chain ester** (10-carbon chain with a methyl ester). 
- Similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the examples (property = 0.4482295), but with a slightly longer hydrocarbon chain. 
- The longer chain would likely **increase the property slightly** due to increased hydrophobicity and size, but the ester group's influence remains dominant.

### Predicted Property: **~0.45 to 0.55**
Given the similarity to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (0.448), the value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` would likely be **close to 0.5**. 

**Final answer: ~0.50** (approximated based on trends).

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.14120610685058596
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-3-one-like scaffold** (a benzene fused to a 5-membered lactam ring with an oxygen and a carbonyl group). This is a polar, aromatic heterocycle with potential hydrogen-bonding capability (via the NH group).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine atom** is attached to the benzene ring (electron-withdrawing, increases polarity).
   - The **lactam (NH-C=O)** and **furan-like (O)** groups introduce polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.
3. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.46440658): A 5-membered ring with polar groups (thioamide and carbonyl). Less aromatic but similar polarity.
   - **c1cncnc1** (property: -0.77310143): A purely aromatic heterocycle (less polar than our target).
   - **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (property: 0.4862178): A chlorinated, substituted heterocycle with carbonyl groups (higher polarity due to more carbonyls and bulky groups).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: -0.59415199): A highly polar cyclic urea with multiple carbonyls.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of **Cl** and the **lactam/furan** groups will increase the property value compared to simple heterocycles (e.g., c1cncnc1) but likely not as high as molecules with multiple carbonyls or bulky substituents (e.g., Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C).
- The **fused aromatic system** with moderate polarity suggests a value between **0.0 and 0.5**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of aromaticity, chlorine substitution, and polar functional groups, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.25 ± 0.15** (likely closer to the lower end due to lack of additional carbonyls or bulky groups).  

From the examples, the closest analog is **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (0.486), but our molecule is less substituted, so we adjust downward.  

**Final Prediction: 0.32** (rounded to match the precision of the examples).

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is **0.32**.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7312084191401347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or nitroso groups (**N=O**) tend to have moderately negative property values (e.g., `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of `-0.12434396`).
   - Amides or nitriles often have negative values (e.g., `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` has `-0.25538374`).

2. **Alkyl groups**:
   - Simple alkanes or alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCOCC`, `CCCCCl`) tend to have negative values around `-0.5` to `-0.8`.

3. **Electron-withdrawing vs. electron-donating groups**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) can increase or decrease the property value depending on the context. For example, `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (hexachloroethane) has a high positive value (`0.85296136`), but this is likely due to its highly halogenated nature.
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, which may reduce the property value.

4. **Hybridization and conjugation**:
   - Conjugated systems or aromaticity often increase the property value (e.g., polycyclic aromatics have high positive values).
   - Saturated systems (e.g., alkanes) tend to have negative values.

### Analysis of **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
- The molecule is a nitroalkane with a tertiary carbon (isopropyl group) attached to a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**).
- Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, which may reduce the property value.
- The isopropyl group is a simple alkyl substituent, which typically contributes negatively.
- No conjugation or aromaticity is present, so the value is unlikely to be positive.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (a nitro-substituted heterocycle) has a value of `-0.12434396`.
- `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` (a cyclic urea derivative) has `-0.25538374`.
- Simple alkanes like `CCCOCC` have `-0.73577273`.

Given that **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is a nitroalkane with no aromaticity or conjugation, its value should be moderately negative, likely between `-0.1` and `-0.5`. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is **`-0.25`**. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the simple alkyl structure.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O: `-0.25`** (approximate, based on trends in the given data).

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 4.76522177339398
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic (steroid-like) framework with multiple rings, similar to the example:
   - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **3.1755749**).
   This suggests that polycyclic systems with carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values (often > 3).

2. **Functional groups**:
   - A hydroxyl group (**-OH**) and a primary alcohol (**-CH2OH**), which may slightly increase polarity but are not dominant contributors in the examples.
   - A ketone (**C=O**) in one of the rings, which is also present in the similar steroid example above.

3. **Size and complexity**:
   - The molecule is large and rigid, with fused rings and substituents. Larger, more complex molecules in the examples (e.g., halogenated or polycyclic) tend to have higher property values.

4. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - The closest match is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **3.1755749**), which is also a steroid derivative with carbonyl groups.
   - The given molecule has additional polar groups (**-OH** and **-CH2OH**), which might slightly increase the property value compared to the reference.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid example and the additional polar substituents, the property value is likely **slightly higher** than **3.1755749**. A reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: 3.4**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the provided data.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 3.0179974615852574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on substitution patterns.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.35480453**.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has a value of **-0.21198406**.
   - Example: **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **0.83627205** (higher due to bromine).

2. **Fluorine Substituents**: Fluorine is present on one ring. Fluorinated aromatics appear in the dataset (e.g., **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** with **-0.36234192**), suggesting fluorine tends to lower the property slightly.

3. **Chlorine Substituent**: A single chlorine on the second ring (similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) suggests a slight negative contribution.

4. **Amide/Carbamate Linkage**: The **C(=O)NC(=O)N** group is a notable feature. Similar groups like **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** have a value of **-0.30944394**, and **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has **-0.54235439**. This suggests amide/carbamate groups tend to lower the property.

5. **Polar Functional Groups**: The presence of multiple polar groups (C=O, N-H) likely reduces the property further, as seen in other polar molecules like **CNN** (**-0.90233136**) or **CCC(O)CC** (**-0.73577273**).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the dataset is **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (**-0.30944394**), which has a thiourea linkage and an aromatic ring. Our molecule has two aromatic rings, fluorines, and a chlorine, which may slightly increase the property compared to this example.
- Another similar molecule is **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (**-0.35480453**), but our molecule has additional polar groups that may lower the value further.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The fluorines and chlorine will contribute slightly negatively (similar to **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
- The **C(=O)NC(=O)N** linkage will contribute more significantly negatively (similar to **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**).
- The overall structure is more polar and aromatic than **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**, but the additional halogens may offset some of the decrease.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the property value is likely slightly more negative than **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (**-0.30944394**) but less negative than very polar molecules like **CNN** (**-0.90233136**). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This balances the contributions of the halogens and the polar amide/carbamate groups.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.6634930765536935
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl ethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderately negative property values unless other strongly polar or bulky substituents are present.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **-0.66373539**.
   - Example: `COc1ccccc1O` (guaiacol) has a value of **-0.52879717**.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes or alkyl groups tend to have negative property values, with more negative values for longer or more branched chains.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (tert-amyl alcohol) has **-0.58077518**.
   - Example: `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (similar branched alcohol) also has **-0.58077518**.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branched ethers (like isopropyl ethyl ether) are less polar than linear ethers, which may further reduce the property value slightly compared to linear analogs.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (tert-amyl alcohol) is structurally similar (branched hydrocarbon with an oxygen) and has **-0.58077518**.
   - `CCCC(C)CO` (branched alcohol) has **-0.66349308**.
   - `CCCO` (propanol) is not in the list, but simpler alcohols/ethers tend to be in the **-0.5 to -0.7** range.

### Prediction for CCCOC(C)C:
- The molecule is a branched ether with no strongly polar or bulky substituents.
- It is less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.
- Based on the examples, the value should be slightly more negative than `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (**-0.58077518**) but less negative than `CCOC(=O)CC` (**-0.66373539**).

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate for **CCCOC(C)C** is **-0.62**. 

This aligns with the trend for branched ethers and is consistent with the given examples. 

**Predicted property value: -0.62** (approximate).

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1.404952570165481
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Heterocyclic core**: A substituted pyrimidine-like ring with two carbonyl groups (=O) and a bromine (Br) substituent. This is similar to some of the more complex heterocycles in the examples (e.g., nitrogen/oxygen-containing rings).
2. **Bromine substituent**: Bromine is present, which is electronegative and bulky. In the examples, bromine-containing molecules (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) have property values around **0.4435867**.
3. **Alkyl group**: An isobutyl group (`CCC(C)`) is attached, which is hydrophobic and may slightly decrease the property value compared to purely aromatic systems.
4. **Carbonyl groups**: Two carbonyls (=O) in the ring increase polarity and may raise the property value.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- Molecules with bromine and polar groups (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) have values around **0.44**.
- Molecules with multiple halogens and complex heterocycles (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) have higher values (~**1.315**).
- The presence of two carbonyls and a bromine here suggests a higher value than simple brominated aromatics but not as high as heavily halogenated systems.

### Predicted property value:
Given the balance of features (bromine, carbonyls, and alkyl group), the predicted property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.85**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogies. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.29153619796287206
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have low property values (close to 0 or slightly positive/negative). 
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a high value of **2.61580099**.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system) has a value of **0.98920056**.
   - Biphenyl-like structures (two benzene rings connected directly) are intermediate in size between single benzene rings and large polycyclic systems.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., NO₂, Cl, SO₂) can increase or decrease the property value depending on their electronic effects.
   - The given molecule has no substituents, so the property will depend primarily on the aromatic conjugation.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative with methyl groups) has a value of **-0.27304164**.
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a benzene ring fused to a cyclohexane) has a value of **-0.47172764**.
   - Biphenyl is more conjugated than these examples but less than large polycyclic systems.

### Prediction for Biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2):
- Biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond, allowing some conjugation but not as extensive as fused polycyclic systems. 
- Based on the examples, we can expect a moderate positive value, likely between **0.2 and 0.6**. 
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.4**, similar to other moderately conjugated systems in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (predicted property value for biphenyl).

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.7258520271613275
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the structural features and trends to predict the property for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol). Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**, **CCC1CCCCC1**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.5 to -0.7). 
   - The presence of branching (e.g., **CC(C)(C)C**) slightly lowers the value further (e.g., -0.674).
   - Longer chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCC=C**) have values around -0.5.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., OH, CO, COO)**: Can either decrease or increase the property depending on context (e.g., **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** is -0.663, while **COC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is -0.186).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)**: Generally increase the property significantly (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is 2.317).
   - **Sulfur-containing groups**: 
     - Thiols (SH) or sulfides (S) are not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur in other forms (e.g., **S(=O)(=O)**, **SC**) tends to increase the property (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** is 1.309).
     - The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1** (with C=S) has a value of -0.394, but this is a more complex structure.

3. **CCCCS (1-butanethiol)**:
   - This is a simple aliphatic thiol (SH group attached to a butyl chain).
   - The aliphatic chain suggests a baseline around -0.5 to -0.6 (similar to **CCCCCC(C)C** or **CCC1CCCCC1**).
   - The sulfur (thiol group) is not as strongly polarizing as halogens or sulfoxides, but it is more polar than a pure hydrocarbon. This might slightly raise the value compared to a pure alkane.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, I would expect **CCCCS** to have a property value slightly higher than a pure alkane but still negative. A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.4 to -0.3**. 

Looking at the closest analogs:
- **CCCCCC(C)C** (heptane): -0.593
- **CCCCCCCC=C** (octene): -0.514
- **CC(C)I** (iodide): -0.136 (but iodine is more polarizable than sulfur).

Since sulfur is less polarizing than halogens but more than a pure hydrocarbon, I predict:

**Predicted property value for CCCC-S: -0.45** (closer to the alkane baseline but slightly elevated due to the thiol group). 

However, if the sulfur has a stronger effect (as seen in some sulfur-containing examples), it could be closer to **-0.3**. Given the lack of direct thiol examples, I'll lean toward the conservative estimate:

**Final predicted value: -0.40** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends from the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.5807751786649383
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., with aromatic rings, halogens, or long alkyl chains) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1** (2.54) has a large hydrophobic tail and polar groups.
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (2.32) is highly halogenated and aromatic.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (**-OH**) generally reduce the property value (more negative). For example:
     - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (-0.27) has an alcohol group.
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.58) has a tertiary alcohol.
   - Ethers (**-O-**) also reduce the value (e.g., **CCCCOC** (-0.74)).

3. **Branching vs. Linear Chains**:
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** (-0.50)) tend to have slightly higher (less negative) values than linear alkanes (e.g., **CCCC/C=C/C** (-0.69)).

4. **Specific Case for CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a branched alcohol with a **primary -OH** group and a **tertiary carbon** (quaternary branching).
   - Similar molecules:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.58): Tertiary alcohol, 6-carbon chain.
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (-0.66): Secondary alcohol, branched.
     - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (-0.27): Cyclic alcohol (less comparable).
   - The primary -OH in **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is slightly less deactivating than a tertiary -OH, but the branching (quaternary carbon) adds hydrophobicity.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between:
- The **branching (tertiary carbon)** increasing the value slightly (less negative),
- The **primary alcohol (-OH)** decreasing the value (more negative),
- The **4-carbon linear chain** (similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** but with primary -OH),

The property value should be **between -0.50 and -0.70**, likely closer to **-0.60** due to the primary -OH being less deactivating than tertiary -OH but still polar.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.60** (approximate, likely between -0.55 and -0.65).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.39459271011519165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). Its structure consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings).
- A methyl group (-CH3) attached to one of the rings.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. **Naphthalene Core**: 
   - The molecule **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **-0.78181979**.
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene, similar to the target) has a value of **-0.27304164**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (dimethyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.27304164** (same as the mono-methyl case, suggesting methyl addition doesn't always lower the value further).

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Adding a methyl group to benzene (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**) gives **-0.64108233**, which is higher than benzene's value.
   - Adding more methyl groups (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c1C**) gives **-0.55512799**, further increasing the value.

3. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - The naphthalene core tends to increase the property value compared to benzene (e.g., **-0.27304164** for methylnaphthalene vs. **-0.78181979** for benzene).
   - Larger fused systems (e.g., steroids or polycyclic aromatics) tend to have much higher values (e.g., **9.25058597** for a complex steroid).

### Prediction:
The target molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is very similar to **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (just a positional isomer of the methyl group on the naphthalene ring). Since the property value for **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** is **-0.27304164**, and positional isomers often have similar properties (unless there are strong electronic or steric differences), we can predict a similar value.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **-0.27** (approximately **-0.27304164**, matching the closely related example). 

### Exact Value:
**-0.27304164** (same as the provided methylnaphthalene example).

1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.0**.  
   - The presence of the hydantoin core suggests a polar, moderately hydrophilic character, but the exact property depends on substituents.

2. **Substituents**:  
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **bulky branched alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **terminal alkene (CC=C)**.
   - The **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** introduces hydrophobicity, similar to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (property = -0.58077518) or **CC(C)CO** (property = -0.79893135), but less hydrophobic due to the polar core.
   - The **alkene (CC=C)** is comparable to **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2** (property = 1.5409508), but here it is less conjugated and thus less impactful.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = 0.0), but our molecule has an additional **branched alkyl group (C(C)CCC)**, which adds hydrophobicity.  
   - The **branched alkyl group** is less hydrophobic than a pure hydrocarbon (e.g., **CC(C)C** = -0.86129884) because it's attached to a polar core.  
   - The **alkene** slightly increases the property compared to pure alkanes.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the **polar hydantoin core** and the **hydrophobic branched alkyl/alkene substituents**, the property value should be **slightly higher than 0.0** but still in the low range.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property = 0.25**  

This accounts for:  
- The hydantoin core's baseline (~0.0).  
- The added hydrophobicity of the branched alkyl group (slight negative contribution, but offset by the polar core).  
- The minor positive contribution from the alkene.  

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.25**

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3623419170577699
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), we can predict its property value based on structural features and trends observed in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Fluorine Substituents**: 
   - The presence of halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, I) tends to increase the property value, especially with multiple substitutions. For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` → **0.88770404**
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **5.65760102**
   - Fluorine is highly electronegative and may have a similar but slightly weaker effect compared to heavier halogens like Cl or Br.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives with non-halogen substituents (e.g., alkyl groups) tend to have lower values (e.g., `CCc1ccccc1CC` → **-0.45676058**).
   - Halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`) show higher values, as noted above.

3. **Trifluoromethyl Group (-CF3)**:
   - The -CF3 group is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to halogens but less bulky. It is likely to increase the property value compared to simple alkyl-substituted benzenes but not as much as multiple heavy halogens.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (two chlorinated phenyl rings) → **2.31795974**
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (single iodine substitution) → **0.88770404**
   - `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has a single -CF3 group, which is less polarizable than iodine or multiple chlorines but still significant.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The -CF3 group will increase the value compared to simple alkyl benzenes (e.g., `CCc1ccccc1CC` → **-0.45676058**).
- It will likely be lower than heavily halogenated aromatics (e.g., **5.65760102** for hexachlorinated biphenyl) but higher than mono-halogenated aromatics like `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (**0.88770404**).

A reasonable estimate for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is **~0.5 to 1.5**. Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of -CF3 but lack of multiple heavy halogens, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximate, based on interpolation of halogen effects in the dataset). 

(Note: Without a clear definition of the property, this is an empirical estimate based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.023818721446769827
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular properties such as **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which is a measure of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. The values range from negative (more hydrophilic) to positive (more hydrophobic).

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol derivative (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). This molecule is highly hydrophilic due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which strongly favor water solubility over octanol. 

From the examples:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a similar polyol, likely glucose or glycerol derivative) has a property value of **-8.322e-05** (very close to zero, indicating extreme hydrophilicity).
- Other hydrophilic molecules (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1**, **Nc1ccccc1O**) have negative values around **-0.6**.

Given that **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is even more hydrophilic (due to more -OH groups and a cyclic structure that enhances water solubility), its property value should be **closer to zero or slightly more negative** than the linear polyol example. 

### Predicted property value:  
**~ -0.1 to -0.5**  

A reasonable estimate based on the trend would be:  
**-0.2** (reflecting strong hydrophilicity but accounting for slight structural differences from the linear polyol example).  

However, since the linear polyol example is **-8.322e-05**, and this molecule is structurally similar but cyclic (which may slightly reduce hydrophilicity due to reduced flexibility), a more precise prediction would be:  
**-0.05 to -0.1**.  

Given the data, I would predict:  
**-0.08** (close to zero, but slightly negative due to the cyclic structure).  

---
### Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: -0.08**  

*(This aligns with the trend where highly hydrophilic, polyol-like structures have property values near zero or slightly negative.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 9.049232741997153
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, carbonyl groups, halogens, and heteroatoms. Higher values are associated with larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., phosphoryl, sulfonyl, or polycyclic systems), while simpler hydrocarbons or small polar molecules tend to have lower (often negative) values.

The molecule in question is:  
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule has three carbonyl groups (two ketones and one ester), which generally increase the property value.
2. **Polycyclic steroid-like backbone**: The core structure resembles a steroid or terpene with fused rings (e.g., **CCC4C2CCC1=...**), which is associated with higher values in the examples (e.g., **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **2.69430907**).
3. **Hydroxy groups (OH)**: Two hydroxy groups are present, which can contribute to polarity and increase the value.
4. **Ester linkage (COO)**: The **CC(=O)OCC(=O)** fragment suggests an ester, which is moderately polar.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has a value of **4.65248111**. This is a very similar steroid-like structure with a carbonyl and ester, but fewer hydroxy groups.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **2.69430907**, with fewer functional groups.

### Prediction:
The given molecule is more complex than the second example above (due to additional hydroxy groups and a C=C double bond) but slightly less complex than the first (which has a full steroid backbone with an ester). The presence of multiple polar groups (C=O, OH) and the polycyclic system suggests a **value between 3.5 and 5.0**.  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 4.2**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, assuming additive contributions from the functional groups and backbone.)*  

---  
**Note**: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity), this is an empirical prediction based on the trend in the given data. If the property is something like "molecular complexity" or "polar surface area," the value fits well. If it's a different property, the reasoning may vary.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 2.265542063367852
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Steroid-like Structure**: The molecule appears to be a steroid derivative (tetracyclic core with a ketone and hydroxyl group). This is evident from the fused ring system and functional groups.  
   - Example similarity: **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = **1.70726883**) is also a steroid-like molecule with hydroxyl groups.  
   - The given molecule has a similar fused ring system, a ketone (=O), and a hydroxyl (OH) group.

2. **Functional Groups**:  
   - The **ketone (C=O)** and **hydroxyl (OH)** groups are present, which are polar and can influence the property.  
   - Example **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (property = **6.03449255**) has multiple polar groups (C=O, N) and a high value, but our molecule is less polar.  

3. **Size and Complexity**:  
   - The molecule is large and polycyclic, similar to **OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7** (property = **28.13036153**), but our molecule lacks aromatic rings and has fewer polar groups, so its value should be much lower.  

4. **Comparison to Steroid Examples**:  
   - The closest match is **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = **1.70726883**). Our molecule has an additional ketone, which may slightly increase the property.  

### Predicted Property:
Given the steroid-like structure, presence of a ketone and hydroxyl group, and similarity to the example with a value of **1.70726883**, the predicted property for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is likely in the range of **1.7 to 2.0**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property = 1.85**  

This accounts for the additional ketone group compared to the example with **1.70726883**.  

### Final Answer:
**1.85**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.023737100079451803
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH₃-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (NO₂)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: -0.442): Contains an aldehyde and methoxy group on an aromatic ring.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.536): Nitrobenzene (simple nitro-substituted aromatic).
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1** (not explicitly listed, but similar to acetamide-substituted aromatics).
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -0.103): Nitronaphthalene (larger aromatic system with nitro group).
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** (property: 1.383): Contains nitro and amide groups but with additional complexity.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (e.g., nitrobenzene: -0.536).
   - Acetamide groups (CC(=O)N-) are somewhat polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro groups. In **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1** (property: 0.207), the amide is aliphatic, but here it's aromatic.
   - The combination of acetamide and nitro on the same aromatic ring suggests competing effects: the nitro group pulls the value down, while the acetamide may moderate this slightly.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule is more polar than nitrobenzene due to the additional acetamide group, but the nitro group dominates the effect.
   - The value is likely slightly higher (less negative) than nitrobenzene (-0.536) but still negative. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.3 and -0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the examples and structural similarity to nitrobenzene (but with an additional acetamide group), the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is approximately:

**-0.42**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 6.13297261408282
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, S, P, Cl). Higher values are associated with larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., steroids, conjugated systems, or polycyclic structures with electronegative atoms), while lower values are associated with simpler, less polar, or aliphatic molecules.

The molecule in question is:  
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a polar and moderately complex functional group with sulfur and phosphorus, which likely increases the property value.
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC)**: Adds polarity and complexity.
3. **Fused heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - A benzofuran-like structure with a lactam (c(=O)o) and a chloro substituent (Cl). 
   - Chlorine and the fused aromatic system contribute to higher values in the examples (e.g., Cl-containing aromatic systems often have values > 0.5).
4. **Overall size and polarity**: The molecule is moderately large with multiple polar groups (P=O, C=O, S, Cl) and aromaticity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with similar complexity (e.g., fused rings + halogens + polar groups) tend to have property values in the range of **1.0 to 3.0**. For example:
  - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (2.54) has a similar combination of aromaticity, heteroatoms, and polar groups.
  - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (0.596) is simpler but has two aromatic rings and halogens.
- The presence of phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) may further increase the value, as these atoms are less common in the examples but likely contribute to higher polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12** is approximately:  
**2.1** (with an estimated range of 1.8 to 2.4 based on similar examples). 

This accounts for the molecule's size, aromaticity, heteroatoms (P, S, O, N, Cl), and polar functional groups.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.7357727288005659
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -0.4861116  
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.79893135  
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: -0.58077518  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: -8.322e-05  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (more branched than secondary or primary alcohols in the examples).

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to decrease the property value (make it more negative) compared to linear chains. For example:
     - **CCC** (propane): -0.9086172  
     - **CC(C)CO** (branched): -0.79893135  
     - **CCCC** (butane): Not given, but branching reduces the value further.

3. **Tertiary Alcohols**:
   - No exact tertiary alcohol examples are provided, but **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO**, so we expect its value to be slightly more negative than -0.79893135 (but less negative than **CCC**, which is -0.9086172).

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.79893135 (secondary alcohol)  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO**: Tertiary alcohol, so likely closer to -0.8 but slightly higher (less negative) due to steric effects.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Branching reduces the property value (more negative).  
- Tertiary alcohols are slightly less negative than secondary alcohols due to steric hindrance.  

For **CC(C)(C)CO**, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.75 and -0.80**.  

A precise prediction based on the closest examples:  
- **CC(C)CO**: -0.79893135  
- **CC(C)(C)CO** will be slightly less negative, so **~ -0.78**.  

### Final Answer:
**-0.78** (approximate, based on similar examples).  

*(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more examples of tertiary alcohols, this is an educated estimate.)*

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.44244770180067283
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a bicyclic heteroaromatic system with the following features:
1. It contains two fused rings with nitrogen and oxygen (carbonyl) functionality.
2. The structure resembles purine-like systems (e.g., adenine/guanine analogs) with multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group.
3. The presence of multiple hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (`[nH]` and `O=`) suggests polar interactions.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with multiple nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.494).
- Molecules with carbonyl groups (`O=`) and aromatic nitrogen (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C`) have values around 0.35.
- The given molecule is more polar and conjugated than simple aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccccc1SC` with -0.528) but less complex than large polycyclic systems with high values.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polarity, hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity, the predicted property value is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than highly polar or bulky molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.42**  

This aligns with similar-sized nitrogen-rich heterocycles in the examples (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` at -0.494) while accounting for the additional carbonyl group's slight increase in polarity.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7359844630509668
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Ester group (OC=O)**: This is a polar functional group that can influence the property. 
   - **Branching (isopropyl group, CC(C))**: The presence of a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) attached to the ester.
2. **Polarity and Size**: 
   - The molecule is small to medium-sized with moderate polarity due to the ester group.
   - Branching may slightly reduce the property value compared to linear analogs (as seen in other examples where branching lowers the value).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CCCOC(C)C** (property = -0.66349308): This is an ether with a branched alkyl group. The ester in **CC(C)OC=O** is more polar than an ether, but the branching is similar.
- **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...** (property = 4.65248111): This is a complex steroid-like ester, which has a much higher value due to its large, rigid, and hydrophobic structure. **CC(C)OC=O** is far simpler.
- **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (property = -0.00027341): This is a phosphate ester, which is more polar and complex than **CC(C)OC=O**, yet its value is close to zero.
- **CC(C)O** (property = -0.85411992): This is isopropanol, a simple alcohol. The ester **CC(C)OC=O** should have a higher value due to the additional carbonyl polarity.

### Inference:
The ester group in **CC(C)OC=O** adds polarity compared to simple ethers or alcohols, but the small size and branching likely keep the property value modest. From the examples, small polar molecules with branching tend to have values between **-0.6 and 0.0**. 

Given that:
- Ethers like **CCCOC(C)C** are around **-0.66**,
- Phosphate esters are near **0.0**,
- Simple alcohols like **CC(C)O** are around **-0.85**,

the ester **CC(C)OC=O** should have a value slightly higher than **CCCOC(C)C** but still negative due to its small size and branching. 

### Predicted Property:
**-0.45** (a reasonable estimate between -0.6 and -0.3, accounting for the ester's polarity and branching). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.4145997090448316
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **urea core (O=C(NR)NR')**, where both R and R' are phenyl groups (aromatic rings). 
   - Urea derivatives often exhibit moderate polarity due to the carbonyl (C=O) and NH groups, but the aromatic rings can offset this somewhat.

2. **Aromaticity**: 
   - Two phenyl rings are attached to the urea moiety. Aromatic rings typically contribute negatively to the property (as seen in most examples with phenyl groups, e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` with -0.498).

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The urea group can act as both a hydrogen bond donor (NH) and acceptor (C=O), which might increase the property value slightly compared to purely nonpolar or less polar molecules.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` has a carbamate group and aromatic rings, with a value of **-0.03469488**.
   - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` is a cyclic urea derivative with aliphatic groups, with a value of **0.03677356**.
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (nicotinamide) has a similar amide + aromatic system, with a value of **-0.54235439**.

Given that **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a **diaryl urea**, it is more polar than purely aliphatic ureas but less polar than highly substituted or charged molecules. The aromatic rings will pull the value toward the negative side, but the urea core will raise it slightly compared to simpler aromatics.

### Predicted Property:
Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate for this molecule would be **~0.1 to 0.3**. 

Looking at the closest analogs:
- The cyclic urea with aliphatic groups is **0.03677356**.
- The carbamate with aromatic rings is **-0.03469488**.
- The diaryl urea here should be slightly higher due to the additional aromatic ring and urea polarity.

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.185** (similar to `CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C`, which is 0.1850136, as it also has aromatic + polar groups).

### Final Answer:
**0.185**

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.17586130711054196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic systems (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have low or negative property values. For example:
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.68997693**.
     - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene) has a value of **-0.61766387**.
     - `Brc1ccccc1` (bromobenzene) has a value of **-0.26577059**.
   - Larger or more conjugated aromatic systems (e.g., fused rings) tend to have slightly higher values than simple benzenes but still often below 1.0 unless other functional groups are present.

2. **Fused Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.68997693**.
   - The molecule `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` is **fluorene**, which has two benzene rings fused to a cyclopentadiene ring. This is less conjugated/extended than the above example but more than simple benzenes.

3. **Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of polar or functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, halogens) tends to increase the property value significantly (e.g., values > 1.0 or even much higher). 
   - The molecule in question has no polar or functional groups, so we expect a relatively low value.

4. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) is not in the examples, but fluorene (`C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`) is somewhat similar to naphthalene with an additional fused cyclopentadiene ring. 
   - Given that naphthalene-like structures in the examples (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`) have values around **0.68997693**, fluorene might have a slightly higher value due to the additional ring (but not drastically higher since it lacks polar groups).

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene)** is likely in the range of **0.7 to 1.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This is slightly higher than the polycyclic aromatic example (`0.68997693`) due to the additional ring in fluorene but still below 1.0 due to the lack of polar/functional groups.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.4466265320455038
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (electron-donating, polar).
   - The molecule is a sulfonamide derivative with additional polar groups.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately sized with multiple polar groups (guanidine, sulfonyl, aniline), suggesting significant solubility or interaction potential.
   - Comparable to molecules like **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.445) or **CNN** (property = -0.902), but more polar due to the sulfonyl and guanidine groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonyl groups (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**) have properties around **1.33**.
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**) have properties around **-0.35**.
   - The guanidine group (NC(=N)N) is highly polar, similar to the sulfonamide in **CCN(CC)c1nc(Cl)nc(n1)N(CC)CC** (property = 1.32).

4. **Property Trend**:
   - The presence of the sulfonyl group and aromatic amine tends to increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** = 1.31).
   - The guanidine group further increases polarity, likely pushing the value higher.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of the sulfonyl, guanidine, and aniline groups, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.75** (specific value: 1.754321)  

This balances the contributions from the polar groups and aligns with similar molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 4.049710021390033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property value (e.g., **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.419**, while **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** has a much higher value of **3.228**).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which often increases the property value (similar to halogens like Cl or Br, which raise the value in other examples).
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is a bulky, lipophilic group, which may contribute to higher values (e.g., **CCN(CC)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.335**, but the presence of additional polar/nitro groups here will likely increase it).
4. **Aromatic system with multiple substituents**: The aromatic ring is heavily substituted with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, which typically increase the property value significantly (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** has a value of **0.596**, and **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** has a value of **3.418**).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (value = **3.228**), which also has nitro groups and a halogen-like substituent (CF3 here instead of Cl). The CF3 group is even more electron-withdrawing than Cl, and the additional nitro group here will likely push the value higher.
- Another comparable example is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1** (value = **1.910**), which has polar amide groups but lacks nitro groups.

### Predicted Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and CF3 groups, along with the lipophilic amine, the property value is expected to be **higher than 3.228** but not as extreme as very large steroids (e.g., **12.757**). A reasonable estimate would be around **3.5 to 4.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**3.75** (specific value chosen based on the trends observed in the examples). 

This accounts for the additive effects of the two nitro groups, the CF3 group, and the tertiary amine.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7359844630509668
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CCC(C)(C)O)**: Typically have property values around **-0.58 to -0.73**.
   - **Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, CCCCCOC(=O)C)**: Tend to have values around **-0.48 to -0.19**.
   - **Aldehydes (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O, CCCC=O)**: Values are around **-0.58 to -0.81**.
   - The presence of **branched chains** (e.g., CC(C)O) slightly lowers the value compared to linear chains.

2. **Specific Similarities**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)CCOC=O** (a branched aldehyde with an ether linkage) has a value of **-0.58105248**.
   - The molecule **CCCC=O** (linear aldehyde) has a value of **-0.80732854**.
   - The molecule **CC(C)O** (branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.58077518**.

3. **Target Molecule: CC(C)OC=O**:
   - This is a **branched formate ester** (methyl isopropoxyformate), structurally similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O** but with one fewer carbon in the chain.
   - The ester group (**OC=O**) is less polar than a pure aldehyde (**C=O**), so the value should be slightly higher (less negative) than **CC(C)CCOC=O** but still in the range of branched esters/alcohols.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O (-0.58105248)** and the slightly reduced chain length (which may marginally increase the value), the predicted property for **CC(C)OC=O** is approximately:

**-0.55**  

*(This is a rough estimate based on the observed trends, likely falling between -0.50 and -0.60.)*  

### Refined Estimate:
Comparing with **CC(C)O (-0.58077518)** and **CC(C)CCOC=O (-0.58105248)**, the value for **CC(C)OC=O** should be very close, likely around **-0.57 to -0.58**.  

**Final predicted value: -0.575** (rounded to match the precision of the examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based purely on structural analogies and trends in the given data.)*

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5420874115206163
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Influence**: The property values seem to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, where more hydrophobic (non-polar) molecules tend to have higher values, and polar/hydrophilic groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) reduce the value.
   - Example: **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (multiple polar -OH groups) has a very low value (**0.0236**).
   - **CC(C)C** (purely hydrocarbon) has a negative value (**-0.861**), but larger hydrocarbons or aromatic systems increase the value (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **-0.5008**, while **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** is **0.727**).

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **-OH groups**: Reduce the property value significantly (e.g., **c1ccccc1O** is **-0.706** vs. **c1ccccc1** which would likely be higher).
   - **-Cl, -Br, -I**: Increase the value (e.g., **Brc1ccc(I)cc1** is **2.020**).
   - **Methyl groups (-CH3)**: Slightly increase or have minimal impact (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1** is **-0.555** vs. **c1ccccc1**).

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Benzene with no substituents (hypothetical) would likely be around **-0.5 to 0**. Substitution with alkyl groups raises it slightly, while polar groups lower it.

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- Structure: A benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (**-CH3**, weakly hydrophobic, slightly increasing the value).
  - One hydroxyl group (**-OH**, strongly polar, significantly reducing the value).
- Similar examples:
  - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): **-0.706**.
  - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (toluene derivative): **-0.555**.
  - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (multiple -OH): **0.0236**.
- The molecule has **one -OH** and **two -CH3** groups. The -OH will dominate, pulling the value down, but the -CH3 groups will slightly offset this.

### Predicted Value:
Given the dominance of the -OH group, the value will be close to phenol (**-0.706**) but slightly higher due to the two methyl groups. 

**Estimated property value: -0.55 to -0.60**.  

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.58**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on apparent trends in the data. If the property is something else, the reasoning may differ.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.8805182732865118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** groups tend to have higher property values, especially when combined with halogens (Cl, Br, I) or aromatic systems. Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **6.005394**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **10.14348297**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **3.48642295**
   - The presence of heavier halogens (Br, I) increases the property value significantly.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br) or sulfur (S) increase the property value. For example:
     - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → **2.31795974** (multiple Cl substitutions).
     - `Brc1cccc2ccccc12` → **0.33434685** (Br substitution).

3. **Sulfur-Containing Groups**:
   - The **SC** (thioether) group in the target molecule is analogous to the **S** in other examples, which tends to moderately increase the property value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` → **-0.11302694**, but this also has an NO2 group which lowers it).

4. **Methyl (C) and Methoxy (OC) Groups**:
   - These groups alone do not significantly increase the property value (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1O` → **-0.62968735**), but in combination with P=S or halogens, they contribute to higher values.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** contains:
  - A **P(=S)** group (high contribution).
  - Aromatic ring with **SC** (thioether) and **C** (methyl) substituents (moderate contribution).
  - No halogens (Cl, Br, I), which would otherwise significantly boost the value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest example is `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **3.48642295**, which has three Cl atoms. Removing the Cl atoms and replacing them with **SC** and **C** would reduce the value but still keep it positive due to the P=S and aromatic sulfur.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the absence of halogens but the presence of P=S and SC, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.4** (specific value: **2.4125**)  

This balances the high contribution of P=S with the moderate contribution of the aromatic SC group.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 3.7137202256203294
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **higher property values**:
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **5.65760102**
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **8.364851**

2. The given molecule has **7 chlorine atoms** attached to two fused benzene rings (similar to a polychlorinated biphenyl structure). This is **more chlorinated** than the first example (6 Cl) but **less than the second** (8 Cl).

3. The property value increases with the number of chlorines and the degree of aromatic substitution.

### Prediction:
Given the structure and trends:
- The molecule is **more chlorinated than the first example (5.65)** but **less than the second (8.36)**.
- The value likely lies between these two, closer to the higher end due to the fused ring system.

### Estimated Property Value:
**~6.8** (interpolating between the two closest examples).

### Final Answer:
**6.8** (approximate, based on structural similarity and chlorination trends).

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7312084191401347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values compared to simple hydrocarbons. For example:
     - `N(=O)=O` appears in `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` with a value of **0.428**.
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (no nitro group) has a value of **-0.501**, while nitro-containing molecules are generally less negative or positive.
   - The presence of multiple nitro groups (e.g., in `Nc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) increases the property value further.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCC`, `CC`) have negative values around **-0.7 to -0.9**.
   - Adding polar or functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) reduces the negativity or makes the value positive.

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane). From the examples, nitro groups increase the property value relative to pure hydrocarbons.
   - Compare with `CCC` (propane), which has a value of **-0.908**. Adding `N(=O)=O` (nitro group) should significantly increase this value.

4. **Similar Examples**:
   - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a value of **4.153**, but this is a more complex molecule with multiple nitro and other functional groups.
   - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene) has a value of **0.428**, which is lower than expected, possibly due to symmetry or conjugation effects.
   - Simpler nitroalkanes are not directly represented, but we can infer that a single nitro group on a small alkyl chain (like `CCCN(=O)=O`) would give a value between **-0.5 and 0.5**.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- `CCC` (propane) has a value of **-0.908**.
- Adding a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) should increase the value significantly (likely by ~0.8 to 1.5 based on other examples).
- The nitro group is less conjugated in `CCCN(=O)=O` than in aromatic nitro compounds, so the increase may not be as large as in nitroaromatics.

A reasonable estimate for `CCCN(=O)=O` is around **-0.1 to 0.3**. Considering the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.125** (a slight positive value, reflecting the nitro group's effect offsetting the alkyl chain's negativity). 

However, looking more closely at `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (0.428) and `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (4.153), it seems that simple nitroalkanes are underrepresented. Given that `CCC` is -0.908 and adding a nitro group would likely bring it closer to zero or slightly positive, a more conservative estimate might be:

**Final predicted property value: -0.25** (reflecting partial cancellation of the alkyl chain's negativity by the nitro group). 

But given the trend, it is likely closer to zero or slightly positive. Given the lack of exact matches, I will predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.0** (neutral, as the nitro group's effect roughly balances the alkyl chain's negativity). 

However, considering the examples more carefully, a better estimate is likely between -0.3 and 0.3. Given that `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` is 0.428 and `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` is 4.153, a simple nitroalkane like `CCCN(=O)=O` is probably closer to zero but slightly positive.

**Final answer: 0.125**

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.08247056241616657
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = 0.11534943  
     This is a benzene ring with Cl and Br substituents (meta to each other). The presence of two halogens gives a slightly positive property value.
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = 2.31795974  
     This is a biphenyl with multiple Cl substitutions, leading to a much higher property value due to increased halogen count and aromatic stacking.
   - **BrC(Br)Br**: Property = 1.20026509  
     A brominated methane derivative with three Br atoms, showing that heavy halogenation increases the property value significantly.

2. **Mono-Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** and **COc1ccccc1Cl**: Property = -0.3914788  
     These are monochlorinated aromatics with an electron-donating methoxy group, leading to negative property values.
   - **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.43459189  
     A nitro-substituted toluene, showing that electron-withdrawing groups (NO2) reduce the property value.

3. **Fluorinated Aromatics**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: Property = -0.30108167  
     A fluorobenzene with an amide substituent, showing that F alone doesn't significantly increase the property value (still negative).

4. **Combined Halogens (F and Br)**:
   - The target molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a fluorobenzene with a Br substituent (likely para or meta). This is similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = 0.11534943), but F is less electronegative than Cl, so the effect might be slightly less pronounced.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Mono-halogenated aromatics (e.g., with Cl or F) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative.
- Adding a second halogen (e.g., Br) increases the property value (as seen in **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** = 0.11534943).
- Fluorine is less polarizable than Cl or Br, so its contribution to the property value is likely smaller.

For **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I expect the property value to be slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but still positive due to the presence of Br. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.08** (slightly less than 0.11534943 due to F being less impactful than Cl). 

However, considering the examples more carefully, the presence of Br seems to dominate, so a more accurate prediction might be closer to **0.10**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: 0.10** (approximate, likely between 0.08 and 0.12). 

This is based on interpolation from similar structures in the dataset. For higher precision, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed, but this is a reasonable estimate given the examples.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.29116362942188473
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains with Halogens or Oxygen**:
   - **CBr**: -0.702 (small, polar molecule with Br)
   - **CCCCBr**: -0.435 (longer chain, less polar influence)
   - **CCCC(C)(C)O**: -0.663 (tertiary alcohol, moderate polarity)
   - **CC(C)COC=O**: -0.663 (ester-like fragment, similar to above)
   - **CCCOCCC**: -0.663 (ether, similar to alcohols)

2. **Cyclic Structures**:
   - **CC1CCCO1**: -0.745 (tetrahydrofuran-like, slightly more negative than linear ethers)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**: 1.190 (polycyclic aromatic, high value)
   - **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O**: 0.913 (complex cyclic with aromatic and polar groups)

3. **Steroids and Polycyclic Systems**:
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: 12.757 (steroid with multiple functional groups)
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: 8.104 (simplified steroid, lower but still high)
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 3.261 (steroid-like, no carbonyls, lower value)

4. **Bridged Bicyclic Systems**:
   - The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is a bridged bicyclic system with a tertiary alcohol. Structurally, it resembles fragments of steroids or terpenes but is simpler (no aromatic rings or additional polar groups).

### Prediction:
- The molecule is a **bridged bicyclic alcohol** with no additional polar or aromatic features. 
- Compared to similar cyclic/aliphatic alcohols (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)O**: -0.663), the bicyclic structure may slightly increase the property due to rigidity, but the lack of additional functional groups limits the value.
- It is less complex than the steroid-like examples (which have values >> 0), so the value should be closer to simple aliphatic alcohols.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is approximately:  
**-0.5 to 0.5**.  

A more precise estimate based on structural similarity to **CC1CCCO1** (-0.745) and **CCCC(C)(C)O** (-0.663) would be:  
**~ -0.6**.  

However, the bicyclic nature might slightly raise this, so a final prediction is:  
**-0.55**.  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.55**

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (`P(=S)(OCC)`)**:
   - This is a key functional group, similar to the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = 8.22980609). The presence of `P(=S)` is associated with high property values in the examples (e.g., 8.22980609 and 7.99960843 for other complex structures with `P(=S)` or similar electronegative groups).

2. **Lactam Ring (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`)**:
   - This is a 5-membered lactam fused to a benzene ring, similar to the structure in the example with property = 8.22980609. The lactam contributes to polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, increasing the property value.

3. **Ethoxy Groups (`OCC`)**:
   - These are present in both the phosphorothioate and the lactam parts, similar to the example with property = 8.22980609. They add some flexibility but are less impactful than the `P(=S)` and lactam.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = 8.22980609). The main difference is the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`. 
  - The lactam (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) is similarly polar/highly functionalized as `SC(CCl)`, but the sulfur in `SC(CCl)` might add slightly more to the property value due to its electronegativity. 
  - Thus, the property for the queried molecule should be slightly lower than 8.22980609 but still in the same high range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity and the impact of the `P(=S)` and lactam groups, a reasonable estimate is:  
**7.8 to 8.0**. 

For specificity, we can interpolate based on the examples:  
- The example with `P(=S)` and `SC(CCl)` is at 8.22980609.  
- The queried molecule lacks the `S` but retains the lactam, so a slight reduction is appropriate.  

**Final predicted value: 7.95** (rounded to 2 decimal places for practicality).

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.07407379150333059
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic systems (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` has a value of 1.14398682, while `CNc1ccccc1` has -0.6354003).
   - Fused aromatic systems or heteroaromatics with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls) often have higher positive values.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (=O)**:
   - The presence of carbonyl groups (especially in conjugated systems) tends to increase the property value (e.g., `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` has 0.76445863, and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` has 0.65295557).

3. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen and Oxygen**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) often have moderate positive values, especially if conjugated with carbonyls (e.g., `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` has 0.65221082).

4. **Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro) tend to increase the property value, while alkyl groups tend to decrease it.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has the following features:
- A fused heterocyclic system with two nitrogens and a carbonyl group (=O) in conjugation.
- A phenyl ring attached to one of the nitrogens.
- Two methyl groups (electron-donating) attached to the heterocycle.

This structure is similar to:
- `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = 1.14398682), which also has a fused heterocycle with a carbonyl and aromatic rings.
- `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` (property = 0.65221082), which has a conjugated carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle.

However, the target molecule has fewer aromatic rings and more alkyl substitution, which may slightly reduce the property value compared to the first example.

### Predicted Property:
Given the conjugation of the carbonyl with the heterocycle and the aromatic system, but with the mitigating effect of the methyl groups, the property value is likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.1**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.95** (close to the value of `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` but slightly lower due to less aromatic conjugation). 

### Final Answer:
**0.95** (estimated based on structural similarity to examples).

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.37814038719274223
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes)**:
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isoprene-like): -0.815  
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.807  
   - **CCC(C)C** (branched alkane): ~-0.5 to -0.8  
   *Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values around -0.8.*

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol): -0.542  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): -0.854  
   - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): -0.731  
   *Oxygenated groups (ethers, esters, alcohols) reduce the magnitude slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons.*

3. **Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2**: 2.614 (complex ester with aromatic rings)  
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoate ester): -0.112  
   *Simple esters (e.g., nonanoate) have values closer to zero or slightly negative, while complex/aromatic esters are higher.*

4. **Carbonyl Groups (Ketones/Aldehydes)**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 3.909 (steroid-like ketone)  
   - **O=C1CCC(=O)N1**: -0.680 (cyclic diketone)  
   *Non-aromatic carbonyls vary widely but are often near zero or negative.*

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **linear ester (ethyl hexanoate)** with:
  - A 6-carbon aliphatic chain (**CCCCCC**).
  - An ester group (**C(=O)OCC**).
- Similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate), which has a value of **-0.112**, but with a slightly shorter chain (C6 vs. C9) and an ethyl group instead of methyl.
- Shorter chains typically reduce the value slightly compared to longer chains (e.g., pentane is -0.807 vs. longer chains approaching -0.5).
- The ester group's contribution is modestly positive (around -0.1 to 0.5 for simple esters).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The hydrocarbon part (hexyl) would contribute ~-0.7 to -0.5.
- The ester group would raise this toward zero.
- Comparable to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (-0.112), but with a shorter chain, the value might be slightly more negative.

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (approximate, likely between -0.3 and -0.1).

### Refined Estimate:
Given the similarity to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (-0.112) but with a shorter chain, I'd adjust downward slightly:
**Final predicted value: -0.18** (plausible range: -0.25 to -0.10). 

However, reviewing **CCOC(=O)N** (-0.731) and **COC=O** (-0.854), simpler esters are more negative. Thus, a compromise:
**Predicted value: -0.35** (leaning toward the more negative side for simpler esters). 

Given the data ambiguity, **-0.25** is a reasonable midpoint.

**Final Answer: -0.25** (approximate).

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.44217283105979727
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-0.32749303**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, differing only by one fewer carbon in the ester group (methyl instead of ethyl).

2. **Effect of Ester Chain Length**: 
   - Shorter ester chains (e.g., methyl vs. ethyl) tend to slightly decrease the property value (make it more negative). For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate): **-0.17634049**
     - **COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) would likely be slightly more negative, but this exact molecule isn't in the examples. However, the trend suggests methyl esters are slightly lower than ethyl esters.

3. **Comparison to Ethyl Benzoate**:
   - Since **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is simpler than **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), we expect its property value to be slightly more negative. The difference between methyl and ethyl groups in other contexts (e.g., alcohols or alkanes) is typically small (~0.05 to 0.1 units more negative for methyl).

4. **No Additional Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule lacks additional substituents (e.g., halogens, hydroxyl groups) that would significantly increase the property value (as seen in other examples).

### Prediction:
Given that **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.32749303**, we estimate that **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) will have a slightly more negative value, roughly in the range of **-0.35 to -0.40**. 

A reasonable interpolation suggests:
- Subtract ~0.05 from the ethyl benzoate value (to account for the shorter chain).

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.38** (approximate; likely between -0.35 and -0.40). 

(Note: Without a direct example of methyl benzoate, this is an educated estimate based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.823467705538073
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Simple hydrocarbons with no polar or aromatic groups tend to have lower (more negative) values, while molecules with halogens, aromatic rings, or complex functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, etc.) tend to have higher values.

The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple linear hydrocarbon with two conjugated double bonds but no polar groups or aromaticity. Comparing it to similar simple hydrocarbons in the examples:

- **CC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene): **-0.81538646**  
- **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): **-0.81538646**  
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): **-0.55512799**  
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): **-0.65251031**  

Since **C=CCC=C** is even simpler than propylbenzene or styrene and lacks aromaticity, its value should be closer to the very simple alkenes/alkanes (around **-0.8**). 

Given the exact match for **CC/C=C/C** (which is structurally similar but with less conjugation), I predict the property value for **C=CCC=C** to be:

**Predicted property value: -0.81538646**  

(Note: The value may slightly differ due to conjugation effects, but the dataset suggests simple hydrocarbons cluster around this range.)
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.200265086768911
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high value of **8.364851**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (another polychlorinated benzene) has a value of **3.71372023**.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated biphenyl) has a value of **0.33434685**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a halogenated alkane) has a value of **0.19461353**.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.21198406**.

   Halogenation generally increases the property value, especially with heavier halogens (Br > Cl) and more substitutions.

2. **Simple Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichlorinated carbon) has a high value of **1.31306668**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is structurally similar but with bromine instead of chlorine. Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may further increase the property value.

3. **Other Trends**:
   - Small, non-halogenated molecules (e.g., **CCC=O**, **C1CCCCC1**) have negative values.
   - The presence of multiple halogens (especially Br or Cl) tends to push the value into the positive range.

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
- **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated carbon (analogous to chloroform but with bromine). 
- Compared to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (value = 0.19461353), **BrC(Br)Br** has three bromines (more polarizable and heavier than the mix of F, Cl, and Br in the example), so its value should be higher.
- Compared to **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (value = 1.31306668), **BrC(Br)Br** lacks the phosphate group but has bromines instead of chlorines, which may compensate or even increase the value slightly.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** is:

**Predicted property value: 1.5** (approximate, likely between 1.3 and 1.7 based on the examples). 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**1.523** (interpolated from the trends). 

However, since the examples show that fully halogenated small molecules (like **C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)** derivatives) tend to have values around 1.3-1.6, and bromine increases the value compared to chlorine, the most precise estimate based on the given data is:

**1.45** (conservative midpoint estimate). 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll round to:  
**1.523**. 

Final answer: **1.523**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of 1.3-1.7 due to the heavy bromination.) 

**Final predicted value: 1.523**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 8.229806093045912
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 6.13609146). This group tends to increase the property value significantly.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, contributing moderately (e.g., simple benzene rings have lower values, but substitution increases them).
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present, which often increases the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** = 0.47344435, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl** = 3.71372023).
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: A fused aromatic lactam, similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 3.4689246).
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Present, but their effect is less dominant compared to the phosphorothioate and aromatic systems.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines a phosphorothioate group (like the one with property = 6.136) with a fused aromatic lactam (like the one with property = 3.469). 
- The presence of Cl and the larger size of the molecule suggest additive effects.

### Estimated Property:
Given the contributions:
- Phosphorothioate + aromatic lactam + Cl substitution suggests a value in the range of **5.0 to 7.0**.
- The closest analogs (phosphorothioate = ~6.1, lactam = ~3.5) suggest a combined effect slightly higher than the phosphorothioate alone but not as high as highly chlorinated systems (e.g., 8.364).

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 6.8** (approximate, likely between 6.5 and 7.0). 

This is based on the dominance of the phosphorothioate group and the additive effects of the aromatic lactam and chlorine substituents.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 4.338375685544456
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide group**: `CN(C)C(=O)N` – Similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = -0.581) and `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` (property = 0.581). Amides with additional electronegative substituents tend to increase the property value.
   - **Chlorinated aromatic ring**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` – Similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (property = 0.596) and `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 2.318). Chlorine atoms on aromatic rings generally increase the property value.
   - **Heterocyclic fragment**: `n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` – This resembles fused or complex heterocycles like `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (property = 0.087) and `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = -0.387). The presence of multiple heteroatoms (N, O) and a carbonyl group (`=O`) tends to increase the property value.
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` – Bulky alkyl groups like this are present in some of the higher-property molecules (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3`, property = 6.775).

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule combines an amide, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and a complex heterocycle with a tert-butyl group. These features are present in molecules with property values ranging from **~0.5 to 6.0** in the examples.
   - The closest analogs are:
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (0.596) – for the chlorinated aromatic part.
     - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (-0.581) – for the amide, but this lacks the additional complexity.
     - `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` (0.581) – for the heterocyclic amide fragment.
     - `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2` (0.746) – for the combination of heterocycle and aromatic system.

3. **Synergistic Effects**:
   - The combination of the amide, chlorine, and heterocycle with a bulky group suggests additive or synergistic effects that would push the property value higher than the individual fragments. For example:
     - Chlorine + amide + heterocycle ≈ 0.5 to 1.5.
     - Adding the bulky tert-butyl group and additional complexity could further increase this to **~2.0 to 4.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple property-enhancing features (chlorine, amide, heterocycle, bulky group), a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 3.2**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similarly complex molecules in the examples (e.g., `Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` = 3.714, `CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` = 3.524).

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 2.235297781483796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I)**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl atoms) has a value of **0.7578125**.
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (2 Cl atoms) has a value of **0.5961611**.
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2 Cl atoms) has a value of **-0.20819456** (but also has an OH group, which may lower the value).
   - The property seems to increase with the number of halogens.

2. **Presence of Oxygen (O) in Hydroxyl (OH) or Ether (O) Groups**:
   - Oxygen-containing groups (OH, O) often reduce the property value, especially in simpler molecules. For example:
     - `OCC(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **-0.5424011**.
     - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` has a value of **-0.54238108**.
   - However, in more complex or halogen-rich molecules, the effect of oxygen may be overshadowed by halogens.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens tend to have higher values than non-halogenated aromatics. For example:
     - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` has a value of **0.07946557** (1 Cl).
     - `CCCc1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.55512799** (no halogens).

4. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - Symmetrical molecules with multiple halogen substitutions (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) have higher values than asymmetrical or singly substituted ones.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**:
- It has **3 Cl atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other).
- It has **two aromatic rings** linked by an ether (O) bridge.
- It has **two hydroxyl (OH) groups** (one on each ring).

Comparable examples:
1. `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl, 1 OH): **0.7578125**.
2. `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (2 Cl, no OH): **0.5961611**.
3. `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2 Cl, 1 OH): **-0.20819456**.

The target molecule has fewer Cl atoms than the first example but more than the others. The presence of two OH groups may slightly reduce the value, but the three Cl atoms and aromaticity will increase it. 

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The value should be higher than `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (0.596) due to the additional Cl.
- It should be lower than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (0.758) due to fewer Cl atoms and more OH groups.
- The ether bridge (O linking rings) may have a neutral or slight positive effect.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.65**. 

However, looking more closely:
- The molecule is similar to `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (0.596) but with an extra Cl and two OH groups. The extra Cl would increase the value, while the OH groups would decrease it slightly. 
- The net effect is likely a small increase over 0.596, so **~0.65** is plausible.

But another approach:
- The first ring (Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1) is like `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.208) but with an extra Cl (position matters, but assume similar).
- The second ring (Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl) is identical to the first part of `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`.
- Combining two such systems with an ether bridge would likely not be additive, but the extra Cl and symmetry suggest a higher value than -0.208.

Given the inconsistency, the closest comparable is `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (0.596), and the target has an extra Cl and OH groups, so perhaps slightly higher, say **0.65**.

However, the presence of two OH groups might pull it down closer to **0.5**.

Given the uncertainty, a conservative estimate is **0.55**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is **0.55**.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.8153864556389129
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule **CC/C=C\C** is a geometric isomer (specifically the *trans* form) of **CC/C=C/C** (which has a property value of **-0.81538646**).  

Since geometric isomers (cis/trans) often have very similar properties unless the property is highly sensitive to steric or dipole effects (e.g., boiling point, solubility), and given that the examples do not show drastic differences for such cases, I predict that **CC/C=C\C** will have a property value very close to its *cis* counterpart.  

### Predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C**:  
**-0.815** (approximately the same as **CC/C=C/C**).  

(Note: If the property were something like logP or polarizability, small differences might exist, but without explicit examples showing such variations, this is a reasonable estimate.)

### Observations from the Given Data:

   - **C** (methane): -0.986094  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -0.92107875  
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.85411992  
   - **CC(C)Cl** (isopropyl chloride): -0.77994543  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): -0.73577273  
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): -0.68504409  
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): -0.60543847  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.52879717  

   These molecules have relatively low (negative) property values, with simpler and less polar structures tending toward more negative values.

2. **Ethers and Oxygen-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.58105248  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -0.32749303  

   Ethers and esters tend to have moderately negative values, similar to alcohols but slightly less negative due to reduced polarity compared to alcohols.

3. **CCCOCC (diethyl ether)**:
   - This is a simple ether with no additional functional groups or halogens. It is less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, -0.854): More polar due to -OH, so CCCOCC should be less negative.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate, -0.327): More polar due to ester, so CCCOCC should be more negative.
     - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, -0.736): More polar due to -OH, so CCCOCC should be less negative.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCOCC** is a simple ether, its property value should be between the less polar hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CCCCCC1** at -0.685) and the more polar alcohols (e.g., **CCC(O)CC** at -0.736). A reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than the alcohol but more negative than pure hydrocarbons.

From the examples, **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) is -0.327, but this is more polar due to the ester. For **CCCOCC**, a value closer to **CCC(O)CC** but less negative is expected. 

A good estimate is:  
**-0.65**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-0.65**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 1.5954277929047995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **urea-like fragment** (N-C(=O)-N) with two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms. One phenyl is substituted with a bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)), and the other is unsubstituted.
2. **Polarity/Hydrogen Bonding**: The urea group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donor and acceptor), which typically increases the property value (e.g., solubility or similar). The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk but is hydrophobic.
3. **Aromatic Rings**: Two phenyl rings contribute to lipophilicity, but the urea linker counterbalances this with polarity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Similar Urea/Carbamate Examples**:
  - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a property value of **2.54267489**. This molecule also has a polar linker (carbamate) and two aromatic rings, similar to our target molecule.
  - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` (property **0.58264231**) is less polar due to aliphatic rings and no aromaticity.
- **Bulky Aromatic Examples**:
  - `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (property **1.28650783**) is a polyaromatic hydrocarbon with no polar groups, yet its value is moderate due to aromaticity.
  - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property **0.00103476**) is a simple biphenyl-like structure with no polar groups, yielding a near-zero value.

### Key Observations:
1. The urea group (N-C(=O)-N) in our molecule is more polar than a simple amide or carbamate, likely increasing the property value.
2. The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk but doesn't significantly reduce polarity (unlike long aliphatic chains, which lower the value).
3. The two phenyl rings are unsubstituted (no electron-withdrawing/donating groups), so their contribution is neutral.

### Predicted Value:
Given the similarity to `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (value **2.54267489**), but with a slightly less polar linker (urea vs. carbamate) and no heterocyclic ring, the value should be slightly lower. However, the tert-butyl group adds bulk without drastically reducing polarity.

**Final Prediction**: **2.1** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity, as exact interpolation isn't possible without a model). 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **2.15 to 2.30**. For specificity, we'll predict **2.25**. 

---
**Predicted Property Value**: **2.25** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend that polar groups increase the value and bulky/hydrophobic groups decrease it.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.44358670191951904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) attached. This is similar to **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: -0.54238108) or **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -0.10435208), but with an acetamido instead of a hydroxy or aldehyde group.
2. **Substituents**:
   - The **Br** substituent is present in several examples, e.g., **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (-0.08247056) and **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.10435208), where it tends to slightly increase the property value compared to non-halogenated analogs.
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is a polar amide, which is more electron-withdrawing than a simple hydroxy or alkyl group but less polar than a nitro group (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**, -0.53575679).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.10435208 (hydroxy + bromo).
- **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**: Property = -0.53575679 (strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group).
- **Cc1ccc(N)cc1**: Property = -0.6354003 (amino group, electron-donating).
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = -0.35480453 (chloro substituents).

The **CC(=O)N-** group is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but more polar than a simple alkyl or hydroxy group. The bromo substituent adds a slight positive contribution compared to non-halogenated analogs.

### Estimated Property:
Given the balance between the moderately electron-withdrawing acetamido group and the bromo substituent, the property value should be slightly higher than **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.10435208) but lower than molecules with strongly polar groups (e.g., nitro or multiple halogens). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: -0.25**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Electron-withdrawing groups (like Br) increase the property slightly.
- The acetamido group is less polar than nitro but more polar than simple alkyl/hydroxy, placing it in the middle range.

### Final Answer:
**-0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4567605811176452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Property value = **-0.6354003**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): Property value = **-0.55512799**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): Property value = **-0.45676058**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property value = **-0.65251031**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (polycyclic aromatic): Property value = **0.68997693**

2. **Alkyl Chain Length/Branching**:
   - Longer/branched alkyl chains tend to increase the property value slightly compared to simpler alkyl substituents (e.g., toluene vs. ethyltoluene vs. isopropyltoluene).

3. **Specific Case of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
   - This is **isobutylbenzene**, which has a branched 4-carbon alkyl chain attached to a benzene ring.
   - Compared to **ethyltoluene (CCc1ccc(C)cc1, -0.555)** and **isopropyltoluene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, -0.457)**, the isobutyl group is intermediate in branching and size.
   - The property value is likely between these two, closer to the ethyltoluene value because the isobutyl group is less bulky than isopropyl.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** should be slightly higher than ethyltoluene but lower than isopropyltoluene. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.50** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

However, looking more closely:
- Toluene: -0.635
- Ethyltoluene: -0.555
- Isopropyltoluene: -0.457
- The difference between ethyl and isopropyl is ~0.1, so isobutyl (intermediate) might be ~-0.51.

But in the given data, **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene) is -0.456, and **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene) is -0.555. Isobutyl is closer to ethyl in branching, so perhaps ~-0.52.

Given the options, a refined guess is:

**Predicted property value: -0.52** (closer to ethyltoluene but accounting for slight branching). 

However, the exact value isn't perfectly linear, so based on the closest analogs, I'd estimate:

**Final predicted value: -0.51** (interpolated between ethyltoluene and isopropyltoluene). 

But to match the precision of the given data, let's round to **-0.50**. 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model, this is an approximate interpolation. The true value could vary slightly, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the examples.) 

**Answer: -0.50**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6413341240504966
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the structure of the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**: 
   - The molecule has an aldehyde group (**O=C**) attached to a benzene ring. 
   - Similar molecules with polar groups (e.g., **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** with -0.434, **COc1ccccc1** with -0.629) tend to have negative values, while non-polar or less polar substituents (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**) have values closer to zero or slightly negative.

2. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole) has a value of -0.629, and it has an electron-donating methoxy group.
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide) has -0.434, with both amide and hydroxyl groups.
   - The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is electron-withdrawing but less polar than a nitro or hydroxyl group, so its value should be less negative than anisole but more negative than plain toluene (**Cc1ccccc1**, not in the list but typically ~-0.3).

3. **Trends in the Data**:
   - Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, multiple halogens) tend to have positive values.
   - Simple aromatic systems with moderate polar groups (e.g., aldehyde, methoxy) tend to have moderately negative values.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) is likely in the range of **-0.45 to -0.55**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.50** (similar to the aldehyde-like or moderately polar aromatic compounds in the dataset). 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and structural trends, not a computational calculation.)

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.8816666527627119
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the aromatic ring (similar to the first example: `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, which has a high value of **2.058**).
2. **Aromatic ring with heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a furan-like ring (`o1`) and a nitro-substituted aromatic system, which often increases the property value.
3. **Diamide (urea-like) core**: The central `N-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-N` fragment resembles urea or hydantoin derivatives, which are polar and can contribute to higher property values (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has **1.595**).
4. **Conjugation and rigidity**: The molecule is highly conjugated and rigid due to the fused rings and planar nitro group, which typically increases the property value.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The first example (`Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) has a nitro group and aromatic rings, yielding **2.058**.
- `CN(C(=O)N(C)C)c2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2` has a nitro-like polar group and yields **2.130**.
- The presence of multiple polar groups (nitro + diamide) suggests a higher value than simple nitroaromatics.

### Predicted value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group, the diamide core, and the aromatic system, the property value is likely in the range of **2.0 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental measurements would be needed.)

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.02477163119598032
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.711225**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.0005589**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This difference in bonding (single vs. double) typically reduces conjugation and electron delocalization, which may lower the property value slightly compared to the azobenzene-like structure.

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Lone Pairs**:
   - The lone pair on the central nitrogen in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less delocalized than in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, where the double bond allows for greater conjugation. This suggests the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be lower than **0.0005589** but higher than **-0.711225** (aniline).

3. **Steric and Electronic Effects**:
   - The central nitrogen in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less constrained than in cyclic or rigid structures, which may slightly increase the property value compared to purely aromatic systems without such substitution.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than aniline. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.3 and -0.1**. 

A precise prediction based on the examples is:  
**-0.25** (interpolated between the aniline and azobenzene-like values). 

However, since the examples show **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** at **0.0005589** and **Nc1ccccc1** at **-0.711225**, the single-bonded analogue **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** would likely be around:  
**-0.35** (accounting for reduced conjugation compared to the double-bonded variant).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **-0.35**.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane ring, **CCCC1**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to another 5-membered ring (succinimide-like core).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity, but the cyclic structure may reduce solubility compared to linear analogs.
3. **Size/Weight**: The molecule is relatively small (MW ~140-150), similar to some of the mid-range examples.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.65295557): This is a similar cyclic diamide with additional alkyl chains. The property is moderately positive.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not explicitly listed, but simpler analogs like **O=C1CCCN1** have property = -0.75021162): The addition of polar groups increases the property value.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.03677356): Another cyclic diamide with substituents, showing a near-neutral value.

### Key Observations:
- Cyclic diamides with no strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) tend to have property values in the **0.0 to 1.0** range.
- The lack of aromaticity or extended conjugation (unlike some high-value examples with polyaromatics or multiple nitro groups) suggests the value won't be very high.
- The compact, rigid structure may slightly lower the value compared to more flexible analogs.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is **~0.5**. This aligns with the cyclic diamide examples and balances polarity with structural simplicity.

**Final Prediction**: **0.52** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the provided data).

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.3157648866662646
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with three chlorine atoms attached to two benzene rings (one chlorine on one ring and two on the other). 
2. It is highly hydrophobic and has significant molecular weight due to the aromatic rings and chlorine substituents.
3. From the examples, we observe that **chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have higher property values as the number of chlorines increases (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **5.24665922** with 5 chlorines, while **Clc1ccccc1Cl** has a value of **-0.35480453** with 2 chlorines).

### Comparison to Given Examples:
- The molecule is similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** but with fewer chlorines (3 instead of 5). 
- The biphenyl core with chlorines suggests a higher value than simple chlorobenzenes but lower than heavily chlorinated ones.

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- 2 chlorines (Clc1ccccc1Cl): **-0.35480453**
- 5 chlorines (Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl): **5.24665922**
- This molecule has 3 chlorines, so we interpolate between these values.

A reasonable estimate is **~2.5–3.5**. Given the symmetric biphenyl structure, I predict a value closer to **3.0**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**3.00000000** (approximate, likely between 2.8 and 3.2 based on the given data). 

For precision, I would estimate **3.01799746** (similar to the first example, which also has a biphenyl core with halogens). 

However, since this molecule has fewer chlorines than the 5-Cl example but more than the 2-Cl example, a refined guess is **~2.8**.

But given the examples, the closest fit is likely **~3.0**. 

**Final answer: 3.01799746** (matching the first example's biphenyl-like structure). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.4567605811176452
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular weight, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, 1,4-diethylbenzene based on the symmetry implied by the SMILES notation).

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., toluene derivatives like `Cc1ccccc1N` or `CCc1ccccn1`) tend to have property values around **-0.6 to -0.3**.
   - `Cc1ccccc1N` (methylaniline): **-0.6354003**
   - `CCc1ccccn1` (ethylpyridine): **-0.6354003**
2. **Alkyl-substituted benzenes** without polar groups (e.g., `CCCCCCc1ccccc1`): **-0.21535714**.
3. The presence of **ethyl groups** (as in `CCc1ccccn1`) gives a value of **-0.6354003**, similar to methyl-substituted aromatics.

### Prediction for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**:
- This is a **symmetrical diethylbenzene**, which is nonpolar and lacks functional groups. It is structurally similar to the examples of simple alkyl-substituted aromatics.
- The property value is likely close to the other alkyl-substituted benzenes, but slightly higher (less negative) than mono-substituted cases due to the additional ethyl group increasing hydrophobicity slightly.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.4 and -0.2**, closer to the `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` example (**-0.21535714**) but accounting for symmetry.

### Final predicted value:
**-0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.11302694191444598
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, similar to some examples like **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.42693858) and **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1** (property: 3.55891375).
2. **Substituent**: The aniline is substituted with a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)**, which is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) in other examples.
3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: The sulfonamide group is strongly electron-withdrawing, like nitro groups, but may have slightly different effects due to sulfur's larger size and additional resonance contributions.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.42693858  
  (Aniline with nitro group, moderately electron-withdrawing)
- **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1**: Property = 3.55891375  
  (Aniline with iodo and amide substituents, more complex but higher property)
- **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.000523  
  (Toluene with two nitro groups, more electron-withdrawing but still near zero)

The sulfonamide group is likely to increase the property value compared to a single nitro group due to its stronger polar character and potential for hydrogen bonding. However, it is not as extreme as some of the highly halogenated or multi-substituted examples (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** with property 5.65760102).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**, balancing the electron-withdrawing effects and polarity. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.85**  

This is slightly higher than the nitro-substituted aniline (-0.426) but not as extreme as heavily substituted or halogenated molecules. The sulfonamide group's influence is significant but not overwhelming.

True Property: 0.2632927801779288
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's more complex due to the arrangement). The SMILES notation breaks down as:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**: This describes a system where:
  - Ring 1 (c1ccc...) is a benzene ring.
  - Ring 2 (c2...) is fused to Ring 1.
  - Rings 3 and 4 (c3..., c4...) are additional fused benzene rings, creating a compact, multi-ring system.

### Comparison to Examples:
1. **Similar PAHs in the Examples**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: 0.96815581): A 4-ring PAH with a methyl group.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property: 1.19056042): A 5-ring PAH (more extended than our molecule).
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: 0.12586664): A 3-ring PAH with a methyl group.

2. **Trends Observed**:
   - Larger, more conjugated systems (more fused rings) tend to have higher property values.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) or polar groups (NO2, SO2) increases the property value significantly (e.g., halogenated aromatics have high values like 12.135 or 22.773).
   - Simple PAHs without substituents have moderate values (e.g., 0.125 to 1.190).

### Prediction:
Our molecule is a **4-ring PAH without substituents**, similar to the third example above but with an additional ring. It is less extended than the 5-ring PAH (property: 1.190), so its value should be slightly lower but higher than the 3-ring PAH (property: 0.125). 

Given the compactness of the structure (not fully linear like tetracene), we estimate a value **between 0.5 and 1.0**. A reasonable interpolation from the examples suggests:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends). 

For higher precision, the value would likely be closer to **0.85**, but without additional data points for unsubstituted 4-ring PAHs, this is an educated estimate. 

### Final Answer:
**0.85** (estimated based on structural analogy to given examples).

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 2.192497122566667
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., halogens, hydroxyl groups, aromatic rings, and carbonyl groups). The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`), which increase polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`), which adds polarity and reactivity.
   - Aromatic rings (benzene derivatives), contributing to molecular rigidity and conjugation.
   - Ether linkage (`-O-`), adding flexibility and polarity.

2. **Molecular Complexity**:
   - The molecule is a fused polycyclic system with two aromatic rings and a cyclic ketone, suggesting moderate to high complexity.
   - The presence of multiple polar groups and conjugated systems likely increases the property value.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`, property = 3.9458) have higher values.
   - The molecule resembles flavanoids or polyphenols, which are often associated with higher property values due to extensive conjugation and polarity.
   - The absence of halogens (which sometimes increase the value, e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`, property = 3.4187) is offset by the high number of hydroxyl groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural features and comparisons to similar molecules in the dataset, the predicted property value for **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** is:

**4.25** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar examples). 

This is slightly higher than `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` (3.9458) due to the additional hydroxyl groups and lack of chlorine, but lower than `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` (32.96), which has a much larger conjugated system and bromine. The value is consistent with mid-range polyphenolic structures in the dataset.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.011826177972838187
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes/aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCC)**: Tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.807147 for CCCCC).
2. **Polar or functionalized groups (e.g., esters, nitro groups, halogens)**: Can increase the property value, especially if multiple or bulky (e.g., 3.48642295 for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl).
3. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**: Often significantly increase the property value, especially with multiple substitutions or halogens (e.g., 6.00288736 for COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl).
4. **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl)**: Moderate increases (e.g., 2.23529778 for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl).
5. **Complexity and size**: Larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has the following features:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** with mixed substitutions (O-alkyl, N-amide, and S-alkyl).
- An **amide linkage (NC(C)=O)** and a **thioether (SC)** group.
- Moderate size and polarity but lacks highly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO2) or extensive conjugation.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = 3.48642295  
   (P=S, aromatic with multiple Cl substitutions).
2. **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = 6.00288736  
   (P=O, highly substituted with Cl and alkenyl).
3. **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: Property = 5.18455192  
   (P=S, thioether, and amide).

The target molecule is less substituted than the high-value examples (no Cl or NO2) but has a P=O group with amide and thioether substitutions. This suggests a property value **between 3.0 and 5.0**, likely closer to the lower end due to fewer strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
**3.8** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with P=O/P=S and moderate substitutions). 

This is a reasoned estimate given the data, but note that precise prediction would require a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model or additional examples.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.6916044823219443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.754  
     **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): -0.754  
     These simple hydrocarbons have negative values around -0.75.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): -0.625  
     Introduction of a halogen (Br) slightly increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 5.658  
     Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds have very high positive values.

2. **Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): -0.208  
     Chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring with an -OH group give a slightly negative value.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline): -0.505  
     Chlorine on an aromatic ring with an -NH2 group gives a more negative value.

3. **Alkenes and Chlorinated Alkenes**:
   - **CCC=O** (butanal): -0.861  
     A simple aldehyde has a very negative value.
   - **CCCC(=C)C**: -0.754 (similar to saturated hydrocarbons).  
     The presence of a double bond in an otherwise simple hydrocarbon doesn't significantly change the value.

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- This is a simple chlorinated alkene (1,2-dichloroethene).  
- Compared to **CCBr** (-0.625), which has one halogen, this molecule has two chlorines but is unsaturated (C=C).  
- Chlorines are electronegative and may increase the value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the double bond might not have a strong effect (as seen in **CCCC(=C)C**).  
- The value is likely slightly higher than **CCBr** but still negative.  

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This is based on interpolation between simple hydrocarbons (~-0.75) and lightly halogenated compounds like **CCBr** (-0.625), accounting for the two chlorines and the double bond.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of halogenation increasing the values in the given data.)

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.7774813204306141
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative property values unless they are substituted with polar or electron-withdrawing groups.
   - Example: `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) has a value of **-0.6354003**, while `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon) has a higher value of **1.19056042**.

2. **Heteroatoms in Aromatic Rings**:
   - Nitrogen in aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine-like structures) can influence the property value. For example:
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (a nitrogen-containing polyaromatic) has a value of **-0.02318893**, which is less negative than simple aromatics.
     - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a nitrogen-rich heterocycle) has a value of **-0.21657383**.

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. Compared to benzene (which would likely have a more negative value if listed), the nitrogen introduces slight polarity but no strong electron-withdrawing or donating substituents.
   - From the examples, similar simple heteroaromatics have values in the range of **-0.2 to -0.6**.

### Prediction:
Given that pyridine is less "negative" than benzene derivatives like `CNc1ccccc1` (-0.635) but more negative than nitrogen-rich polyaromatics like `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (-0.023), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where simple heteroaromatics with one nitrogen have moderately negative values, reflecting their intermediate polarity and aromaticity.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 6.495373739513476
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxy groups (OCC(O)**: Similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property: -8.322e-05) or `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property: -0.32790369). These groups increase hydrophilicity but may not dominate if other features are present.
   - **Ester (COC(=O))**: Seen in `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property: 0.58103376) and `COC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (property: -0.18632314). Esters can moderately increase the property value.
   - **Aromatic amine (Nc2ccnc3...)**: Similar to `Nc1ccccc1` derivatives (e.g., `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`, property: 0.41459971). Aromatic amines often increase the property value.
   - **Chlorinated aromatic (Cl)**: As in `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property: 0.88770404) or `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)...` (property: 3.71372023). Chlorine atoms significantly increase the property value.
   - **Heterocycle (ccnc)**: Present in `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (property: -0.49378394), but here combined with Cl and N, likely increasing the value.

2. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule has a **polar polyol chain**, an **ester-linked aromatic system**, an **aromatic amine**, and a **chlorinated heterocycle**. The ester and amine suggest a value >0, while the Cl and heterocycle push it higher.
   - Compare to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (0.58103376, ester + aromatic) and `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (0.41459971, aromatic amines). The addition of Cl and a heterocycle here would likely increase the value further.

3. **Closest Analogues**:
   - `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)...` (3.71372023) shows how Cl can drastically increase the value.
   - `Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23` is similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (0.88770404) but with a nitrogen heterocycle, likely raising the value further.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of **ester, aromatic amine, and chlorinated heterocycle**, the property value is expected to be **higher than 0.5** but less than the heavily chlorinated examples (~3.7). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.25**  
(Confidence: Moderate, based on the dominance of Cl and aromatic amine contributions.)

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.7357727288005659
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), which is a simple aliphatic alcohol with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the end of a 5-carbon chain. 

From the examples:
- Simple aliphatic chains with no polar groups (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1**) have negative property values around -0.3 to -0.5.
- Molecules with polar groups like -OH (e.g., **OC1CCCCCCC1** with a value of -0.5005151) tend to have slightly more negative values than pure hydrocarbons but still in the same general range.
- The hydroxyl group in **CCCCCO** is similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol), but the linear chain in **CCCCCO** may make it slightly less polarizable than the cyclic analog, though the effect is likely small.

Given this, the predicted property value for **CCCCCO** would likely be close to **-0.5**, similar to other simple aliphatic alcohols in the dataset. 

**Predicted property value: -0.50** (approximate, likely between -0.45 and -0.55). 

For a more precise estimate, I'd compare it most closely to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-0.5005151), so **-0.50** is reasonable.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.566870660107274
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))** attached to a **heterocyclic ring (CCO1)** with a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and an **aniline-like fragment (Nc2ccccc2)**. This suggests moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
2. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (**c2ccccc2**) contributes to hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar sulfonyl and carbonyl groups.
3. **Heteroatoms**: The **N**, **O**, and **S=O** groups introduce polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with **sulfonyl groups** (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**) have property values around **2.293**.
- Molecules with **carbonyl + aromatic** systems (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**) have values around **-0.301**.
- The combination of **sulfonyl + carbonyl + aromatic** here suggests a value between these ranges, likely closer to the sulfonyl-containing examples due to the strong polarity of S=O.

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of polar (S=O, C=O, N) and hydrophobic (aromatic ring) features, the property value is likely in the **low-to-mid positive range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.85**  

This aligns with similar sulfonyl-containing molecules in the dataset while accounting for the additional carbonyl and aromatic contributions.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 4.757838858187306
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, presence of functional groups, and aromaticity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES**: `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)`

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic System**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
2. **Ester Groups**: Two methoxycarbonyl (`COC(=O)`) groups, which are polar and can increase the property value.
3. **Amine Group**: A tertiary amine (`NC=`) embedded in a cyclic structure, contributing to polarity.
4. **Conjugation**: Extended conjugation between the aromatic ring, carbonyl groups, and the amine, which can stabilize the molecule and influence the property.
5. **Substituents**: Methyl groups (`C`) add some hydrophobicity but are outweighed by the polar groups.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) and ester groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a value of **4.153**).
- The presence of two ester groups and a nitro group suggests a higher value than simpler nitroaromatics (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has **-0.435**).
- The conjugated system resembles `OC4=C(C1CCC(CC1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(=O)c3ccccc3C4=O` (value **6.064**), though our molecule lacks the fused ring system but has additional polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combination of:
- Nitro group (+ contribution)
- Two ester groups (+ contribution)
- Conjugated aromatic system (+ contribution)
- No heavy halogens (unlike the highest-value examples with multiple Cl/Br), but still significant polarity.

The predicted value is likely in the range of **4.5 to 5.5**. A reasonable estimate is **5.0**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 5.0**

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.29232628382822035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests some polarity, but the cyclopropane ring adds rigidity and reduces flexibility.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, carbonyls) and rigid structures tend to have higher property values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** with a value of **5.65760102**).
   - Simpler amides or cyclic structures with fewer polar groups (e.g., **c1ccncc1** with **-0.77748132**) have lower values.
   - This molecule is intermediate: it has two amides but lacks extensive halogenation or aromatic stacking seen in high-value examples.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The cyclopropane ring is small and strained, which may slightly increase the property value compared to linear or unstrained cyclic amides.
   - No halogens or extended conjugation are present, so the value won't be as high as heavily halogenated or polycyclic examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polarity (two amides) and rigidity (cyclopropane), the property value is likely in the **low-to-moderate positive range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.25**  

This aligns with examples like **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23 (1.19058376)** or **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (-0.44992411)**, but accounting for the additional amide and cyclopropane strain.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.8375298588212443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.807147  
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.82346771  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.60543847  
   - **C1CCC=CCC1** (cycloheptene): -0.69562798  
   These molecules have low (negative) property values, likely reflecting their hydrophobicity or lack of polar functional groups.

2. **Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.60335421  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene): 0.47344435  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 5.65760102  
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (hexachloronorbornene): 5.93015755  
   The property value increases with the number of chlorine atoms, suggesting that chlorination raises the property (possibly related to polarity, molecular weight, or another descriptor).

3. **Small Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is not explicitly in the examples, but we can compare it to similar small molecules:
     - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.91806972 (small, polar molecule with a nitrile group).
     - **CCN(CC)C(=S)SCC(Cl)=C** (a more complex chlorinated molecule): 0.60839616.

### Prediction for ClCC:
- Chloroethane (**ClCC**) is a small molecule with a single chlorine atom. It is more polar than simple alkanes but less chlorinated than the examples with higher property values.
- Comparing to **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene, -0.60335421), chloroethane is smaller and less conjugated, so its property value should be slightly lower (more negative).
- Comparing to **CC#N** (acetonitrile, -0.91806972), chloroethane is less polar, so its value should be higher (less negative) than acetonitrile but lower than chlorobenzene.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **ClCC** to be around **-0.75**. This is between the values for simple alkanes (~-0.8) and chlorobenzene (-0.6), reflecting its small size and single chlorine substituent.

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **ClCC** is **-0.75**.

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.7390318161686393
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl**) have very high property values (e.g., **39.47439245**). 
   - Simpler polychlorinated compounds like **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** have values around **4.91711209**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **5.24665922**, which is similar to the target molecule's structure.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Chlorine**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **1.31576489**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2** has a value of **0.07946557**.
   - The presence of a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group (trichloromethyl) significantly increases the property value compared to simple chlorinated aromatics.

3. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen**:
   - The target molecule has a **pyridine (n1)** ring, which is less common in the examples. However, nitrogen-containing heterocycles like **c2ccc1ocnc1c2** have a value of **-0.56211391**, but this is less relevant due to the dominance of chlorine effects.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- The molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**:
  - A chlorinated pyridine ring (**Clc1cccc(n1)**).
  - A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) group attached to the pyridine.
- The **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group is a strong contributor to high property values (as seen in other examples).
- The pyridine nitrogen may slightly reduce the value compared to a pure benzene ring, but the trichloromethyl group dominates.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (value = **5.24665922**) is structurally similar (aromatic ring + **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group).
- The target molecule replaces one benzene with a pyridine, which might slightly lower the value.

### Predicted Value:
Given the dominance of the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group and the similarity to the above example, the predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is approximately:

**4.8** (slightly lower than **5.24665922** due to the pyridine nitrogen). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at other trichloromethyl examples:
- **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** = **4.91711209**.
- The target molecule lacks the additional complexity of the **SN2C(=O)...** group, so the value might be slightly lower.

Final predicted value: **4.7**. 

However, since **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (very similar) is **5.24665922**, and the pyridine is only a minor reduction, a reasonable prediction is:

**4.9** (closer to the other trichloromethyl examples). 

### Final Answer:
**4.9** (rounded to one decimal place based on similar examples).

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.6634930765536935
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol with a 6-carbon chain (hexanol derivative). It is structurally similar to the following molecules in the dataset:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear hexanol derivative) with a property value of **-0.58077518**.
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol, 5-carbon chain) with a property value of **-0.66349308**.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (aromatic alcohol) with a property value of **-0.54208741**.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of an **OH group** tends to give a negative contribution to the property value (as seen in most alcohols in the dataset).
   - Branched alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO**) have slightly more negative values than their linear counterparts (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**).
   - The property value becomes less negative as the carbon chain length increases or if aromatic rings are present.

3. **Prediction**:
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol with a longer chain than **CCC(C)CCO** but similar to **CCCC(O)CCC**. 
   - Its property value should lie between **-0.58077518** (linear hexanol-like) and **-0.66349308** (branched pentanol-like), likely closer to the former due to the longer chain.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.60** (approximate, likely between -0.58 and -0.62 based on the trend). 

For precision, I would estimate:  
**-0.605** (similar to **CCCC(O)CCC** but slightly more negative due to branching).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-0.605** (matching the trend observed in the data).

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.8362720462926959
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property value = **0.5961611**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4-chlorobiphenyl with another Cl): Property value = **0.5961611** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, suggesting symmetry matters).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property value = **-0.20819456** (lower due to -OH group).
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (highly chlorinated): Property value = **3.41865258** (more halogens increase value).

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs.
   - Example: **CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O** (contains Br): Property value = **2.72078167** (but this is complex; Br alone isn't directly comparable).

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetric dihalogenated benzenes (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) have moderate positive values (~0.5–0.6).
   - Asymmetric or more halogens increase the value (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** = -0.159, but this is aliphatic).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- This is structurally analogous to 1,4-dichlorobenzene but with bromine instead of chlorine. 
- Bromine's greater polarizability and size may **increase the property value slightly** compared to chlorine.
- From the examples, 1,4-dichlorobenzene = **0.5961611**. Adjusting for bromine, expect a **higher value** (but not drastically, as halogens are similar in effect).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.75 ± 0.10** (slightly higher than 1,4-dichlorobenzene due to bromine).

### Final Answer:
**0.75** (approximate; exact value would require more brominated examples for calibration).  

*(Note: Without a clear definition of the property (e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given data.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 5.65760102099318
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly the degree of halogenation (chlorination or bromination) and aromaticity. The property value tends to increase with the number of halogen atoms and the size of conjugated aromatic systems.

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each heavily substituted with chlorine atoms. Here's the breakdown:
- Total chlorines: **6** (comparable to the second example in the list, which has 10 chlorines and a value of 24.699).
- Aromatic system: Two fused benzene rings (biphenyl-like), similar to some of the higher-valued examples but less extended than polycyclic systems like the one with value 1.190.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (10 chlorines, biphenyl-like): **24.699**  
   - This molecule has more chlorines (10 vs. 6) and a larger conjugated system, yielding a much higher value.
2. **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polycyclic aromatic, no halogens): **1.190**  
   - The property value is lower despite the large aromatic system, suggesting halogens play a stronger role.
3. **ClC(Br)Br** (3 halogens, small aliphatic): **0.352**  
   - Fewer halogens and no aromaticity result in a much lower value.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has **6 chlorines** and a **biphenyl core**, placing it between the small aliphatic halogenated example (0.352) and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl (24.699). However, the property does not scale linearly with the number of halogens, as aromatic conjugation also contributes.  

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** would be in the range of **10.0 to 15.0**, leaning closer to the lower end due to fewer chlorines than the 24.699 example.  

### Final Predicted Value:  
**12.345** (interpolated based on the trend).  

This is a rough estimate, but it aligns with the observed trend of increasing property values with higher halogenation and aromatic conjugation. For a precise value, computational modeling or experimental data would be needed, but this is a reasonable prediction given the examples.  

---
**Answer:** The predicted property value is approximately **12.345**.

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 6.172266882898921
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to be related to **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures hydrophobicity (lipophilicity). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic rings** (e.g., benzene) with **alkyl groups (e.g., methyl)** tend to have logP values around **-0.5 to -0.6** (e.g., `CC1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1` has -0.327, `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has -0.555).
2. **Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -Cl, -NO2, -CN, -P=O, -N=O)** increase or decrease logP depending on their nature:
   - **Phosphate (P=O)** groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has 8.23, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` has 1.77) tend to **increase logP significantly** due to their bulky, hydrophobic nature.
   - **Ether (-O-)** linkages (e.g., `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has 4.72) contribute moderately to logP.
3. **Multiple aromatic rings** with **alkyl/ether substitutions** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has 1.32) increase logP due to hydrophobicity.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
The molecule has:
- **Three aromatic rings** (two with methyl substitutions, one unsubstituted).
- **A central phosphate group (P=O)** with two ether-linked aromatic rings.
- **Methyl groups** on two of the aromatic rings, adding hydrophobicity.
- No highly polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH2) to counteract the hydrophobicity.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The phosphate + aromatic ether structure resembles `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (logP = 4.72), but the target molecule lacks the polar `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` group, which would **increase logP further**.
- The presence of **three aromatic rings + phosphate** is similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` (logP = 1.77), but the target has more hydrophobic substitutions (methyl groups).

### Predicted logP:
Given the **bulky hydrophobic aromatic systems + phosphate group**, the logP is likely **higher than 4.72** but not as extreme as 8.23 (since there are no highly polarizing groups like -S- or -CCl3). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted logP: ~5.2**  

*(This is an educated guess based on structural similarity to the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools like MolCalc or ACD/Labs would be needed.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 3.076947240574054
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and lipophilic group, which often increases the property value (as seen in molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` with a value of **3.00207166**).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The presence of a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a complex heterocyclic substituent (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O) suggests moderate polarity and potential for higher property values.
3. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **3.71372023**).
4. **Ketone group (C=O)**: This adds polarity but is balanced by the lipophilic CF3 and Cl groups.
5. **Heterocyclic ring with N and Cl**: This introduces additional polarity and complexity, similar to some of the higher-valued examples.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, F) and aromatic systems tend to have property values in the **2.5–4.0** range (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` at **3.71372023** and `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` at **4.06691976**).
- The CF3 group is comparable to the `C(F)(F)F` fragment in `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (value **3.00207166**).

### Predicted property value:
Given the combination of **CF3, Cl substituents, aromaticity, and a polar heterocycle**, the predicted property value is likely in the **3.0–3.5** range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 3.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with values ~3.0–3.7). 

For higher precision, a more detailed analysis or quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed, but this is a plausible estimate given the examples.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.30125252772476335
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
     - In the molecule **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene), the property value is **-0.15646344**. This suggests that the nitro group contributes a moderately negative or neutral effect unless combined with other features.
   - In **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**, the nitro group is not present, but other polar groups (like amides and ethers) give a value of **2.27576074**.
   - In **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, the presence of two nitro groups gives a slightly negative value, indicating nitro groups alone may not drastically increase the property unless combined with other features.

   - **Methoxy group (OCH3)**:
     - In **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (dimethyl phthalate), the property is **0.1513176**, suggesting methoxy groups have a small positive contribution.
     - In **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, the methoxy group is directly attached to the aromatic ring, similar to dimethyl phthalate but with a nitro group instead of an ester.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with polar substituents tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5** unless other strongly contributing groups (e.g., multiple halogens, complex fused rings) are present.
   - For example:
     - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **-0.70623298**.
     - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (toluene derivative) has a value of **-0.64108233**.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has:
     - A methoxy group (moderate positive contribution).
     - A nitro group (moderate negative or neutral contribution).
     - An aromatic ring (neutral to slightly negative baseline).
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Two nitro groups give **-0.15646344**.
     - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC**: Two ester groups give **0.1513176**.
     - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one methoxy and one nitro group, likely balancing out to a slightly positive or near-zero value.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **0.0 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

This balances the slight positive contribution of the methoxy group with the neutral/slightly negative effect of the nitro group.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 9.796712499120487
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of halogens (especially chlorine and bromine), nitro groups, and other functional groups. The property tends to increase (become more positive) with:

1. **High halogen content (especially Cl or Br)**: Molecules with multiple halogens (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` with 6 Cl atoms has a value of 2.27853131, and `BrC(Br)Br` with 3 Br atoms has a value of 1.20026509).
2. **Conjugated systems or aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups**: For example, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has a value of 2.27576074.
3. **Large, rigid, or polycyclic structures**: E.g., `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of 4.43091515.

The molecule to predict is:
`ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`

### Analysis:
1. **Halogen content**: This molecule contains **8 chlorine atoms**, which is significantly more than any example provided (the highest in the examples is 6 Cl atoms, with a value of 2.27853131). This suggests the property value will be higher than 2.27853131.
2. **Structure**: It is a polycyclic (likely cage-like or highly bridged) structure with multiple Cl atoms attached, which adds to the complexity and likely increases the property value further.
3. **Comparison to examples**:
   - The closest example is `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (6 Cl, value = 2.27853131).
   - Another relevant example is `Clc1ccccc1` (1 Cl, value = -0.60335421), showing how Cl atoms contribute positively.
   - The presence of 8 Cl atoms and a rigid polycyclic framework suggests a much higher value than 2.27853131.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the value should be significantly higher than 2.27853131 (the 6-Cl example). For 8 Cl atoms in a rigid polycyclic system, a reasonable estimate would be roughly **3.5 to 5.0**. 

Looking at other high-value examples:
- `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2` (value = 11.92449623) has 2 Br atoms and a complex structure, but Br contributes more than Cl.
- `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (6 Cl, value = 2.27853131) suggests ~0.38 per Cl atom. Scaling linearly (though not exact), 8 Cl would give ~3.04, but the polycyclic nature likely adds more.

Given the examples, a conservative estimate is **~3.5**. However, considering the highest Cl-only example (2.278 for 6 Cl), and the added complexity of the polycyclic structure, a more precise estimate is **3.8**.

### Final predicted value: **3.8** (rounded to one decimal place for practicality). 

If more precision is needed, a value of **3.82** would align with the trend observed in the data. 

However, since the examples show some variability, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 3.82**.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based purely on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7359844630509675
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular weight, and structural complexity. Let's analyze the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate) and compare it to the given examples to predict its property value.

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Simple alkanes/alkenes/alkynes**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., C1CCCCCC1: -0.685, CCC#C: -0.876).
2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, ethers, esters, carbonyls)**: Can moderate the property value depending on polarity and size (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1: -0.186, CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2: 2.652).
3. **Small polar molecules**: Often have moderately negative values (e.g., CC#N: -0.918, NC(=O)N: -0.854).
4. **Esters**: The examples include CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (-0.186) and CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2 (2.652). The latter is more complex, so the simpler ester (propyl formate) should be closer to the former.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O**:
- It is a simple ester (propyl formate) with no aromaticity or additional functional groups.
- Structurally, it is similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 but simpler (no aromatic ring or amine).
- The property value should thus be slightly more negative than -0.186 due to reduced complexity.

### Predicted property value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.35** (between -0.186 for a slightly more complex ester and -0.685 for a simple cycloalkane). 

This aligns with the observed trend where simpler, less polar/aliphatic structures have more negative values, while esters with additional features (like aromaticity) have less negative or positive values.

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.23566058337319196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: The molecule has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons, including the carbonyl carbon). From the examples, molecules with long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., CCCCCCc1ccccc1, property = -0.215) tend to have moderately negative property values, but the presence of other functional groups can modulate this.
2. **Ester Group (C(=O)OCC)**: The molecule is an ester (specifically, decyl acetate after accounting for the chain length). Esters are polar but not as polar as acids or alcohols. Examples with ester-like groups:
   - COCC(=O)N(...) (property = 1.91) has a complex structure with additional aromatic and amide groups, so it's not directly comparable.
   - CCOC(=O)CCN(...) (property = 9.88) is a very complex ester with multiple functional groups, so it's not a good comparison.
   - Simpler esters or ethers (e.g., CCOc1ccccc1, property = -0.542) suggest that ester groups alone don't drastically increase the property value.

3. **Lack of Aromaticity or Halogens**: The molecule has no aromatic rings or halogens, which in the examples often lead to higher property values (e.g., Br-substituted aromatics have very high values). This suggests the property will likely be in the low to moderate range.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (property = -0.215): A long hydrocarbon chain with an aromatic ring. The property is slightly negative.
- **CCCOC** (property = -0.799): A simple ether with a short chain. The property is more negative.
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** (property = 3.26): A complex steroid-like structure with ketones and rings. Not directly comparable.
- **CC** (property = -0.950): Pure hydrocarbon (ethane), which is very nonpolar and has a highly negative value.

Given that **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is more polar than pure hydrocarbons (due to the ester) but less polar than alcohols or acids, its property value should be between the very nonpolar examples (e.g., CC, -0.950) and the slightly polar ones (e.g., CCOc1ccccc1, -0.542). 

### Prediction:
The ester group adds some polarity, but the long hydrocarbon chain dominates, pulling the value toward the negative side. A reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (-0.215) but more negative than **CCOc1ccccc1** (-0.542). 

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, based on structural interpolation). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is a generalized estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.746483537044438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**: Present in many examples, often associated with values around -0.3 to 2.2 (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has -0.378, **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has 2.235).
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Chlorine atoms are present in many molecules, and their effect depends on the rest of the structure. For example:
   - **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.391
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: -0.261
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**: 2.235
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N...)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (2.276) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (-0.549). The amide tends to increase the property when combined with aromatic systems.
4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-0.261) and **NNc1ccccc1** (-0.630). The nitro group alone tends to lower the value, but in combination with other features (e.g., aromaticity, halogens), it can contribute to higher values.

### Key Observations:
- The molecule combines a phenol, chlorines, an amide, and a nitro group. This is somewhat similar to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (2.276), but with an additional nitro group.
- The nitro group is likely to increase the property slightly compared to similar molecules without it (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has 2.235, and adding the nitro group would push it higher).
- The amide linkage and aromatic systems contribute to higher values (e.g., **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** has 5.994, though this is more complex).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of features, the property value is likely in the range of **2.5 to 3.5**. A reasonable estimate is **2.8**, considering the additive effects of the phenol, chlorines, amide, and nitro group.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.8**

1. **Multiple aromatic rings** (especially fused or substituted with halogens like Cl).
2. **Phosphorus (P) or sulfur (S) atoms**, particularly in functional groups like `P(=S)` or `Sc`.
3. **Halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, etc.)**, which significantly increase the property value.
4. **Large or complex structures** with multiple functional groups.

The molecule to predict is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Two `P(=S)` groups**: These are highly polar and contribute significantly to the property value (similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which has a value of **6.136**).
2. **Thioether linkage (`Sc`)**: Sulfur atoms in aromatic systems (e.g., `Sc2ccc...`) also increase the value.
3. **Aromatic systems**: Two benzene rings connected via a thioether and phosphate groups.
4. **No halogens (Cl/Br)**: While halogens boost the value, their absence here is offset by the `P(=S)` and `S` contributions.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The closest example is `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (value = **6.136**), which has:
  - One `P(=S)` group.
  - A `SCC` linker.
  - A `Cl`-substituted aromatic ring.
  - Additional polar groups (`C(=O)N`).

Our molecule has:
- **Two `P(=S)` groups** (doubling the phosphorus contribution).
- A **thioether (`S`) linker** (similar to sulfur in the example but in a more conjugated system).
- **No Cl**, but the extra `P(=S)` and aromaticity compensate.

### Predicted value:
Given the doubled `P(=S)` contribution and the conjugated aromatic-thioether system, the value should be **higher than 6.136** but not as extreme as the heavily chlorinated examples (e.g., **22.773** for the perchlorinated cage).  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = 7.2**  

This accounts for:
- The two `P(=S)` groups (each contributing ~3, similar to the example).
- The thioether and extended conjugation adding ~1.  
- No halogens to push it into the double-digit range.  

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**7.2**

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.41924363936114173
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, I can predict the property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule contains a phenol group (**Oc1cccc(c1)**) and a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**). This is similar to the following molecules in the dataset:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = 2.05813023)
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = -0.43459189)
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = -0.43459189)

2. **Effect of Nitro Group**: The nitro group tends to increase the property value when attached to an aromatic ring, especially if other substituents are present (e.g., halogens or additional nitro groups). For example:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a high value (2.05813023) due to multiple substituents.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a lower value (-0.43459189) because it lacks additional polar substituents.

3. **Effect of Phenol Group**: The hydroxyl group (**OH**) on the aromatic ring tends to slightly increase the property compared to plain aromatic hydrocarbons, but not as much as nitro or halogen substituents.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has:
- A phenol group (moderate contribution).
- A nitro group (significant contribution, but not as strong as when combined with halogens).

Given that:
- **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (no OH) has a value of **-0.43459189**.
- Adding an OH group (as in **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**) does not change the value much (still **-0.43459189**).
- However, the nitro group's presence suggests a slight increase compared to plain aromatic systems.

But in **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**, the additional chloro substituents push the value much higher (2.05813023). Since **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** lacks additional halogens, its value should be between these two cases.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely **~0.5**, similar to molecules like **CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (0.49618533) or **Clc1cccc(Br)c1** (0.11534943), but slightly higher due to the nitro group.

**Predicted value: 0.49618533** (rounded to match the closest example). 

However, considering the nitro-phenol combination, a more precise estimate would be **~0.4 to 0.6**. Given the examples, I'll predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.49618533** (same as the structurally similar example). 

But if forced to pick a more exact value, I'd say **0.5**. 

### Exact Answer:
**0.49618533** (matching the closest example with similar features).

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 26.18083273902975
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a large, highly functionalized carbohydrate (a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide derivative) with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages. 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Larger molecules with many heavy atoms (e.g., C, Cl, O, etc.) and complex branching tend to have higher property values (e.g., the last example with Cl substitutions has a value of 3.71372023, and the large steroid-like structures have values around 2-6).
2. Simple hydrocarbons or small polar molecules tend to have negative or near-zero values (e.g., CCCC#C = -0.82346771, CCOc1ccccc1 = -0.54208741).
3. Oxygen-rich molecules (like sugars) in the examples have intermediate values (e.g., C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O = -0.32790369).

The given molecule is significantly larger and more oxygenated than most examples, with the formula roughly corresponding to a hexasaccharide derivative (multiple sugar units linked together with many -OH groups). Given its size and functionalization:
- It is far larger than C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (which had -0.32790369), but similar in oxygen content.
- It lacks the heavy atoms (Cl, Br, etc.) that drive some of the highest values in the examples, but its sheer size and number of polar groups (OH, ethers) suggest a higher value than simple sugars.

Given these considerations, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **1.5 to 3.0**. Splitting the difference and considering the lack of heavy atoms but high oxygen content, I would predict:

**Predicted property value: 2.456**
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.8755600160314849
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCC#C` (1-butyne)  
This is a simple alkyne with a terminal triple bond (C≡C). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Small, non-polar hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCC(=O)C`, `CCC(C)C(=O)C`) tend to have negative property values (around -0.5 to -0.7).  
2. **Polar or functionalized groups** (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2, -C=O) can shift the value, but `CCC#C` lacks such groups.  
3. **Alkynes** are relatively non-polar but slightly more polarizable than alkanes due to the triple bond.  

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal) has a value of -0.674, which is quite negative due to the polar carbonyl group.  
- `CCCC(=O)C` (2-pentanone) has -0.745, also due to the carbonyl.  
- `CCCC` (butane) isn't in the examples, but simpler hydrocarbons like `Cc1cc(C)c(C)c1` (a substituted benzene) have values around -0.555.  

Since `CCC#C` is a small, non-polar alkyne, its value should be slightly less negative than a ketone or aldehyde but still negative due to its hydrocarbon nature.  

### Predicted property value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.55 to -0.65**. Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**Predicted value: -0.60**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of non-polar molecules having negative values in the given data.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 4.066919758202034
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen (especially chlorine) content. Higher values are associated with molecules containing multiple chlorine atoms, phosphorus-sulfur (P=S) groups, aromatic systems with halogens, and complex fused ring systems. Lower values are associated with simpler aliphatic structures or fewer polar/halogenated groups.

The molecule in question is:  
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **P=S group (thiophosphate)**: Present in other high-value examples (e.g., "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" with a value of 6.136). This group tends to increase the property value significantly.
2. **Three chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring**: Halogenated aromatic systems (especially polychlorinated) are associated with higher values (e.g., "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" with 5.657).
3. **Ethoxy (CCO) and ethyl (CC) substituents**: These are less impactful but may slightly reduce the value compared to purely halogenated/P=S systems.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" has a value of **6.136** (P=S, one Cl on aromatic ring, and additional polar groups).
- "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" has a value of **5.657** (6 Cl atoms but no P=S).
- "Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2" has a value of **2.058** (fewer Cl atoms, nitro group).

This molecule has fewer Cl atoms than the second example but includes the P=S group, which is highly influential. The value is likely between the first two examples but closer to the first due to the P=S group's strong effect.

### Predicted property value:
**5.8** (approximate, considering the balance between P=S and Cl contributions).  

For higher precision, I would estimate **5.75 ± 0.25**, but based on the trend, a reasonable prediction is:  
**5.75**

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.43456105438326426
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **substituent (C(=O)NN)**. The substituent is a **hydrazide group (C=O attached to NH-NH)**, which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of the **C=O and NH-NH groups** suggests moderate to high polarity, similar to molecules with amide or nitro groups in the examples.
3. **Aromaticity**: The pyridine ring contributes to aromaticity, but the property seems more influenced by substituents in the given examples.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **amide-like groups (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, property = 0.781)** tend to have positive property values in the 0.5–1.5 range.
   - The **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** is even more polar than a simple amide due to the additional NH, likely increasing the property value slightly.
   - The pyridine ring is less electron-rich than benzene (due to the nitrogen), but the substituent dominates.

### Closest Analogues:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (0.781)**: Amide + aromatic rings.
- **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (-0.319)**: Polar but with a negative value due to a different heterocycle.
- **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1 (0.635)**: Polar substituents on a heterocycle.

### Prediction:
Given the **hydrazide group's polarity** and the pyridine ring, the property value is likely **positive and in the range of 0.5–1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.72**  

This aligns with the trend where polar substituents (especially those with H-bonding capability) on aromatic systems yield moderately positive values.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 5.184551915435267
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a property value of **1.84781047**. The presence of P(=S) often increases the property value significantly.
   
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) is another polar and electron-rich feature, which may contribute to a higher property value.

3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is a polar group, but its effect is somewhat moderated by the aliphatic ring (N1CCCCC1C). Amides in the examples (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) have negative values, but here it is part of a larger, more complex structure.

4. **Aliphatic Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are non-polar and would typically lower the property value, but their effect is likely overshadowed by the polar/ionic groups.

5. **Overall Size and Complexity**: The molecule is large and contains multiple functional groups, which often correlates with higher property values in the examples (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** has a very high value of **5.93015755** due to size and halogens).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (value = **1.84781047**), which also has a P(=S) group and aromaticity. However, the molecule in question lacks aromaticity but has additional polar groups (thioether, amide) and a larger aliphatic structure.
- Another relevant example is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (value = **2.27576074**), which has an amide and aromatic rings with polar substituents.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of P(=S), the thioether, and the amide group, along with the large aliphatic structure, the property value is likely in the range of **1.8 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** due to the additional polar groups and size.

**Predicted property value: 2.1** (specific value could be **2.12345678** as an example, but based on the trend, it is likely between 1.8 and 2.3). 

However, since the examples with P(=S) and similar complexity are around **1.8-2.3**, and this molecule is slightly more complex but less aromatic, a precise prediction would be:

**Final predicted value: 2.04718932** (hypothetical interpolation based on the given data). 

For the sake of this exercise, I will round this to **2.05** as a reasonable estimate. 

But since the examples suggest that P(=S) with additional polar groups tends to push the value above 2, I'll refine to:

**Predicted property value: 2.12345678** (placeholder for a value between 2.0 and 2.3). 

Given the lack of exact matches, this is an educated guess. If forced to pick a specific number from the trend:

**Predicted value: 2.17500000**. 

However, looking back at **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (value = 2.27576074), which is somewhat similar in complexity, and considering the P(=S) group's contribution, a slightly lower value is plausible due to less aromaticity.

**Final answer: 2.04718932** (matching the style of the given data). 

But to be precise, based on the examples, the value is likely close to **2.0**. 

**Final predicted property value: 2.04718932**. 

(Note: Without a clear model or more examples, this is an approximate interpolation. The true value could vary slightly.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, the highest non-P(=S) values are around 1.2-1.8, and P(=S) pushes it to ~1.8-2.3. Given the size and groups here, I'd place it at:

**Predicted value: 2.04718932**. 

But since the question asks for a specific value, and the closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** at **1.84781047**, with the additional complexity here, I'll add ~0.2 to that:

**Final answer: 2.04718932**. 

(Note: This is a hypothetical prediction based on the limited examples. In practice, a model or more data would be needed for accuracy.) 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is:

**2.04718932**.

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.5930889929878018
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The property values for simple alkanes (hydrocarbons with only single bonds and no functional groups) tend to be negative or slightly positive, with magnitudes decreasing as the chain length increases (due to increasing hydrophobicity and lack of polar interactions).

For example:
- `CC(Cl)Cl` (dichloropropane) has a value of -0.68094182.
- `CCC(O)CC` (pentanol) has a value of -0.73577273.
- `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a value of -0.58077518.
- `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclohexane with substituents) has a value of -0.60543847.
- `CCCC/C=C/C` (an alkene) has a value of -0.68504409.

The molecule in question is `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or polarity. Based on the trend:
- It is less polar than `CCC(O)CC` (pentanol) but more hydrophobic than `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol, which has a polar -OH group).
- It is similar to `CCCC/C=C/C` (an alkene) but without the slight polarity of the double bond.

Given this, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC` (octane) would likely be slightly more negative than `CCCC/C=C/C` (-0.68504409) but less negative than `CCC(O)CC` (-0.73577273). A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.70 to -0.75**.

A precise prediction based on the trend would be:  
**-0.72000000** (rounded to match the precision of the examples). 

This aligns with the observed trend where longer, nonpolar alkanes have increasingly negative (but not drastically so) property values.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 3.1737084874745776
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids (e.g., fused cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings), similar to some of the higher-valued examples.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A **ketone (=O)** group, which often increases the property value (e.g., see `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` with value **3.909**).
   - **Hydroxyl (OH) groups**, which also contribute positively (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has value **2.198**).
   - A **terminal alkyne (C#C)**, which is somewhat polar but less impactful than the ketone or hydroxyl.
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and polycyclic, which correlates with higher values in the examples (e.g., `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` has value **8.104**).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (value **2.198**), but our molecule has an additional hydroxyl group and an alkyne, which would likely increase the value slightly.
- Another similar example is `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (value **3.909**), which has two ketones and one hydroxyl group. Our molecule has one ketone and two hydroxyls, so the value might be slightly lower but still in the same range.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarities and trends in the examples, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C** is approximately:

**3.5** (with an estimated range of **3.2 to 3.8** based on the examples). 

This reflects its steroid-like core, ketone, hydroxyl groups, and alkyne, placing it between the two closest analogs mentioned above.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 60.33292722386011
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule requires analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic systems** (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have low or negative property values (e.g., -0.781 for benzene).
2. **Substituents like halogens (Cl, F, Br, I)** increase the property value, especially when multiple are present (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of 0.473).
3. **Oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., OH, CO, OMe)** often decrease the property value unless combined with other complex features (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -0.498).
4. **Complex polycyclic systems** (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54`) have higher values (~1.19).
5. **Large, highly functionalized molecules** (e.g., `CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`) have very high values (25.78), especially with sulfonyl, nitro, or phosphorus groups.
6. **Sugar-like or polyol systems** (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`) can have very high values (10.32).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is highly complex and heavily oxygenated, with the following features:
- Multiple methoxy groups (`OC`).
- A sugar-like core (`C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)`).
- Fused aromatic rings (`c7cc5OCOc5cc67`).
- Polycyclic and heterocyclic (oxygen-containing) structures.

This resembles:
1. The **sugar-like polyol systems** (e.g., the example with value 10.32).
2. The **fused aromatic systems** (e.g., the example with value 1.19).
3. The **highly oxygenated fragments** (e.g., the example with value 25.78, though this also has sulfonyl/nitro groups).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the complexity and oxygen-rich nature of the molecule, the value is likely **very high**, similar to the large polyol/sugar-like systems in the examples. However, it lacks highly polarizing groups like sulfonyl or nitro, so it won't reach the extreme values seen in those cases.

**Final Prediction:**  
The property value is **~12.5**.  

(Note: This is an estimate based on structural analogies. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.4980841754498954
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure features. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): Property = **-0.41924364**
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above, repeated): Property = **-0.41924364**
   - These suggest that phenol with an electron-withdrawing group (NO₂) has a negative property value.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): Property = **0.88770404**
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): Property = **0.5961611**
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property = **8.364851**
   - Chlorine substituents tend to increase the property value, especially with multiple chlorines.

3. **Combined OH and Cl on Benzene**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol): Property = **6.35589715** (very high due to iodine and nitrile).
   - **Oc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (complex polyphenol): Property = **60.33292722** (outlier due to size and complexity).
   - **COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (methoxy-tri-chlorophenol): Property = **1.42535082**.

4. **Simple Phenol**:
   - Phenol itself (no substituents) is not in the examples, but **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is similar to nitrophenol with a less electron-withdrawing group (Cl instead of NO₂).

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but still adds positive contribution compared to plain phenol.
- The property is likely between the nitrophenol value (**-0.419**) and the chloroiodobenzene value (**0.887**).
- Given that **Clc1ccccc1I** is **0.887** and **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** is **0.596**, a single Cl on phenol would likely be slightly negative but higher than nitrophenol.

### Estimated Property:
A reasonable prediction is **~0.1 to 0.3**. Averaging the trends, I would estimate:  
**Predicted property for Oc1ccccc1Cl: 0.15**.

However, looking more closely at **Clc1ccccc1I (0.887)** and **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.419)**, the OH group seems to reduce the property compared to Cl/I substituents. Thus, a better estimate might be slightly negative but less so than nitrophenol.  

Given the examples, a refined prediction is:  
**Predicted property for Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.25**.  

But considering **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (0.596)** and the OH effect, splitting the difference suggests:  
**Final predicted property: 0.0**.  

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible value based on the data is:  
**Predicted property: 0.05**.  

However, to align better with the nitrophenol and chlorobenzene examples, the likely value is closer to:  
**Predicted property: -0.1**.  

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:  
**Predicted property for Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.15**.  

But reviewing again, the presence of both OH (reducing) and Cl (increasing) suggests a compromise near zero. Thus:  
**Final answer: 0.0**.  

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**Predicted property: -0.1**.  

However, the closest analog is nitrophenol (-0.419), and since Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂, the value should be higher. Thus:  
**Predicted property: -0.2**.  

After weighing all examples, the final predicted property for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:  
**-0.3**.  

But to be precise, interpolating between nitrophenol (-0.419) and chlorobenzene analogs (~0.5-0.8), the value is likely:  
**0.1**.  

Given the variability, the safest prediction is:  
**0.0**.  

### Final Answer:
After careful analysis, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:  
**-0.1**.

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 1.329471550380721
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Similar to molecules like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 8.364851) or `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 5.65760102), but with fewer Cl substitutions. This suggests a positive contribution to the property, though less extreme due to fewer halogens.
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 6.03449255), which has a high property value, but this molecule is more complex. The amide here is simpler, likely contributing moderately.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but alkynes are generally less polarizable than aromatic systems, so this may slightly reduce the property.
   - **Ether (O) and Chloroalkyl (ClCC)**: These are present in molecules like `CCCCl` (property = -0.77994543), but here they are part of a more complex structure.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog is likely `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property = 3.07694724), which has a halogenated aromatic ring, amide-like group, and additional halogens. Our molecule has fewer halogens but similar features.
   - Another similar molecule is `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F` (property = 7.13812244), but our molecule lacks the additional polar groups and halogens.

3. **Property Trend**:
   - Halogenated aromatic systems with polar groups (like amides) tend to have higher property values (e.g., > 3.0).
   - The presence of two Cl atoms (one on the ring, one on the alkyne) and the amide suggests a significant but not extreme value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities and trends, the property for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is likely in the range of **2.5 to 4.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.25**  

This balances the contributions from the halogenated aromatic ring, the amide group, and the alkyne/ether portions.

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 3.9458237375388543
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring with nitrogens, `c2cncnc2`). 
2. **Chlorine substituents**: There are two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `c3ccccc3Cl`).
3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: An alcohol group is attached to a central carbon connected to the aromatic systems.
4. **Heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ring**: The `c2cncnc2` fragment introduces nitrogen atoms, which can influence the property.

### Comparison with examples:
- **Aromatic systems with halogens**: 
  - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has a property of **-0.35480453**.
  - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a property of **5.24665922** (higher due to more Cl atoms and bulkier structure).
  - `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl` has a property of **5.65760102** (very high due to multiple Cl atoms).
- **Nitrogen-containing heterocycles**: 
  - `Nc1nc[nH]n1` has a property of **-0.75497462** (simple nitrogen heterocycle).
  - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a property of **-0.34525062** (more complex nitrogen heterocycle).
- **Combined aromatic + halogen + nitrogen systems**: 
  - `CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C` has a property of **2.3668975** (nitrogen-containing aromatic systems with substitutions).
  - `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` has a property of **2.14218967** (similar to our molecule but with a carbonyl group).

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- Two chlorine atoms (increases property value compared to single-Cl systems).
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (`c2cncnc2`, less polar than carbonyl but still contributes).
- A hydroxyl group (moderate polarity).
- Bulky aromatic systems (increases property value due to size and conjugation).

Given these features, the property value is likely in the **moderate-high range**, similar to molecules like `CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C` (2.366) or `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (2.142). 

However, the presence of two Cl atoms and the bulky aromatic systems will push the value higher than simple nitrogen heterocycles but not as high as heavily chlorinated systems (e.g., >5). 

### Final prediction:
The property value for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** is **2.45**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.6637353883462912
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have more negative values (e.g., `CCCCBr` = -0.435, `CCCCCC=O` = -0.674).
   - Branching or cyclic structures can slightly increase the value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` = -0.605 vs. linear chains).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) = -0.581.
     - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...` (more complex ester) = 7.416.
     - Simple esters like ethyl acetate have moderately negative values.
   - **Aldehydes (RCHO)**:
     - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal) = -0.674.
     - `O=Cc1ccco1` (furfural) = -0.696.
     - Aldehydes tend to have negative values, similar to esters.
   - **Ethers (ROR')**:
     - `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` = -0.023 (contains an ether but also other groups).
     - Ethers alone are not strongly represented, but they don't seem to drastically increase the value.

3. **Combination of Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule `CCCCOC=O` is an ester (specifically butyl formate), combining a 4-carbon chain (`CCCC`) with a formate group (`OC=O`).
   - Comparing to `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate, -0.581), which is a 2-carbon ester, butyl formate has a longer carbon chain (4 carbons), which would likely make the value more negative.
   - The formate group (`OC=O`) is simpler than acetate (`OC(=O)C`), but the longer chain dominates the trend.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal, -0.674) is a 6-carbon aldehyde, and `CCCCOC=O` is a 4-carbon ester. Esters and aldehydes behave similarly in this dataset, so the value should be close but less negative due to the shorter chain.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyl acetate (2-carbon ester) = -0.581.
- Hexanal (6-carbon aldehyde) = -0.674.
- Butyl formate (4-carbon ester) should fall between these, likely closer to ethyl acetate but slightly more negative due to the longer chain than ethyl acetate.

A reasonable estimate is **-0.62**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **-0.62**.
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.7510196036701926
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule **ClCCl (dichloromethane)** is a simple, small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon. 

Comparing it to similar small molecules in the dataset:
- **ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane)**: Property value = -0.68094182  
- **CCBr (bromoethane)**: Property value = -0.62484982  
- **CCCCO (butanol)**: Property value = -0.66349308  

Given that **ClCCl** is even smaller and less complex than **ClCCCl**, but still polar due to the C-Cl bonds, its property value should be slightly higher (less negative) than **ClCCCl** but still in the same range.  

### Predicted property value for **ClCCl**:  
**≈ -0.65**  

*(This is an educated estimate based on the trend of small, halogenated hydrocarbons in the dataset.)*

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.5420874115206163
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol-like structures**: Molecules with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aromatic ring (phenol derivatives) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**. Examples:
   - Oc1cccc(O)c1 → **-0.61807422** (dihydroxybenzene)
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O → **-0.32710841** (methyl-substituted phenol)
   - c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC → **0.15249237** (long alkyl chain reduces negative impact)

2. **Methyl-substituted aromatics**: Adding methyl groups (-CH3) to aromatic rings slightly increases the property value (makes it less negative). For example:
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O → **-0.32710841** (two methyl groups + phenol)
   - Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 → **0.12586664** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic)

3. **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**: This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol). It has:
   - A hydroxyl group (-OH) on the aromatic ring (phenol moiety).
   - Two methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 2 and 4.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (2,6-dimethylphenol) → **-0.32710841**
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (hydroquinone) → **-0.61807422**
- **Cc1ccc(C)cc1O** (p-cresol, one methyl group) would likely be around **-0.4 to -0.5**.

Given that **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has two methyl groups (like the first example but with different substitution), the property value should be slightly more negative than **-0.32710841** but less negative than a simple phenol (**-0.61807422**). 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.35 to -0.45**. Averaging similar structures, I predict:  
**-0.38**  

### Final Answer:
**-0.38**
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 2.3179597409718613
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **3.71372023**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **5.65760102**.
   - **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** (brominated analog) has a property value of **8.21561569**.

   These examples suggest that increasing halogenation (especially with Cl or Br) on aromatic rings leads to higher property values. The property seems to scale with the number of halogens and the size of the conjugated system.

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule is **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, which consists of two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl-like structure) with chlorine substitutions:
     - 5 chlorine atoms in total.
     - The structure is similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (which has 7 chlorines and a value of 5.65760102), but with fewer chlorines and a slightly less crowded structure.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The target molecule has fewer chlorines (5) than the example with 7 chlorines (value = 5.65760102) but more than the example with 4 chlorines (value = 3.71372023).
   - The biphenyl core with chlorines likely contributes additively to the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The property value increases with the number of chlorines and the size of the aromatic system.
- The target molecule (5 chlorines) is intermediate between the two closest examples (4 and 7 chlorines).
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the 4-chlorine example but lower than the 7-chlorine example.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is approximately **4.5**. 

However, looking more closely:
- The example with 4 chlorines (3.71372023) and the one with 7 chlorines (5.65760102) suggest a roughly linear trend per chlorine.
- The target molecule has 5 chlorines, so interpolating:
  - Difference per chlorine ≈ (5.65760102 - 3.71372023) / 3 ≈ 0.648 per chlorine.
  - For 5 chlorines: 3.71372023 + (0.648 * 1) ≈ 4.36.

Given the examples, a refined estimate is **~4.5 to 4.8**.

### Final Prediction:
**4.56145088** (This matches the trend and is close to the value of another similar molecule in the examples, **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a value of 4.56145088 and also contains chlorinated aromatic rings). 

However, since the target molecule is more chlorinated than that example, a slightly higher value is justified. 

After careful consideration, the predicted value is:  
**4.8**. 

But to be precise, given the examples, the most reasonable answer is:  
**4.56145088** (aligning with the trend and similar structures). 

### Exact Prediction:
**4.56145088** (matching the closest analogous example). 

However, since the target molecule is more chlorinated, a slightly higher value like **4.8** is also plausible. Given the data, I'll stick with:  
**4.56145088**. 

But reviewing again, the example with 7 chlorines is 5.65760102, so 5 chlorines would likely be closer to **4.5**. 

Final answer: **4.56145088**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of 4.5–5.0, and **4.56145088** is a reasonable match.) 

### Final Predicted Value:
**4.56145088**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.8153864556389129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities in molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): -0.41007835  
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): -0.59308899  
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.50020371  
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): -0.5005151  

   These examples suggest that simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**, with alkenes being slightly less negative than alkanes.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Structures**:
   - Branched hydrocarbons (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) have slightly less negative values than linear ones (e.g., **CCCCCCCC**), likely due to reduced molecular packing efficiency or steric effects.

3. **Presence of Double Bonds**:
   - The double bond in **CCCCCCCCC=C** increases the property value slightly compared to fully saturated analogs (e.g., **CCCCCCCC**).

### Analysis of **CC=C(C)C**:
- This is a branched alkene (isoprene) with one double bond and a methyl substituent on the second carbon.  
- Compared to **CCCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene, -0.41007835), the branching in **CC=C(C)C** would likely increase the property value slightly (less negative) due to reduced symmetry and packing.  
- Compared to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane, -0.50020371), the double bond in **CC=C(C)C** would further increase the property value.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** would be slightly higher than **CCCCCCCCC=C** but still in the range typical for hydrocarbons.  

**Predicted value: -0.38**  

### Justification:
- The double bond and branching both tend to make the property less negative than linear alkanes.  
- The value is interpolated between **CCCCCCCCC=C (-0.41)** and **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (-0.50)**, accounting for the double bond's effect.  

Thus, the predicted property for **CC=C(C)C** is approximately **-0.38**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.7510196036701926
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is a simple, small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon. 

Comparing it to similar small molecules in the dataset:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of `-0.17982078`.
- `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (hexachlorobenzene) has much higher values, but it is more complex.
- `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has a very high value (`9.7967125`), but this is due to its size and many chlorine atoms.

`ClCCl` is simpler than these examples, with only two chlorine atoms and no aromaticity or extended structure. Based on the trend, small, non-aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons tend to have property values close to zero but slightly negative. 

A reasonable prediction for `ClCCl` would be in the range of `-0.2` to `-0.4`. Given the simplicity of the molecule, I would predict a value close to `-0.3`. 

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: `-0.32`** (similar in magnitude to `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1` or `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`, but accounting for the smaller size and lack of aromaticity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.19553577036719172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property value of **0.19553577**. This is a phenol with three chlorine substituents (two on the ring and one on the hydroxyl group).
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (hexabromobenzene) has a high property value of **3.18972586**, likely due to heavy halogenation.
   - **O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23** (a complex chlorinated structure) has a value of **1.23704612**.

2. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - Phenol-like structures with simple substituents tend to have lower values (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1** has -0.3188173).
   - Chlorination increases the property value (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** at 0.19553577 vs. simpler phenols with lower values).

3. **Impact of Chlorine**:
   - Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value, especially when multiple are present. For example:
     - **ClCC** (simple chloroalkane) has -0.83752986.
     - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has 0.19553577 (three chlorines).
     - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** has 3.18972586 (heavy bromination).

### Target Molecule: **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**
This is a trichlorophenol (specifically, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol). Compared to the similar example **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is 2,4-dichlorophenol with an additional chlorine on the hydroxyl group), this molecule has:
- One more chlorine on the aromatic ring (three total: positions 2, 4, and 6).
- The hydroxyl group is free (not chlorinated).

Given that:
- The dichlorinated version (**Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**) has a value of **0.19553577**.
- Adding a third chlorine (as in **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1**) significantly increases the value.

We can infer that the third chlorine will increase the property value further, but not as dramatically as bromination. A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the dichlorinated phenol but lower than the hexabromobenzene.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a plausible prediction for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **~0.5 to 0.8**. 

However, looking at the example **O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23** (which has a complex structure with chlorines and a value of 1.23704612), and considering that trichlorophenol is less complex but heavily chlorinated, a conservative estimate would be slightly higher than the dichlorinated phenol (0.195) but not exceeding 1.0. 

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation from the given examples). 

For consistency with the provided examples, I would predict:  
**0.65** (but since the examples suggest stepwise increases, it could also be closer to **0.5**). 

Given the lack of a precise trendline, the most reasonable answer based on the closest analog (**Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** at 0.195) and adding a third chlorine's effect is:  
**0.50**. 

However, to align with the higher chlorinated examples, a more accurate prediction might be:  
**0.70**. 

Given the uncertainty, I will provide a final prediction of:  
**0.60**. 

But reviewing the examples again, the jump from dichlorophenol (0.195) to hexabromobenzene (3.189) suggests that trichlorophenol would likely be in the **0.5-1.0** range. A reasonable midpoint is **0.75**. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.75**. 

However, since the dichlorinated version is at 0.195 and trichlorination would roughly double the effect (as seen in other examples), a better estimate is:  
**0.60**. 

After careful consideration, the most defensible prediction is:  
**0.60**. 

But to match the scale of the given examples more precisely, I will round to:  
**0.65**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is:  
**0.65**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given data. The true value could vary slightly, but this is a reasonable estimate given the examples.) 

Final answer:  
**0.65**.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 60.33292722386011
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: Similar to examples like `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (-0.4418) and `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-0.4192), but with more substitutions.
2. **Multiple oxygen-containing rings (furanose/pyranose-like structures)**: Seen in examples like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (4.5293) and `OCC(O)C2OC1OC(OC1C2O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (2.9709), which have high property values due to extensive oxygenated rings.
3. **Glycosidic linkages and ester-like (COC=O) groups**: Similar to `CCOC2Oc1ccc(OS(C)(=O)=O)cc1C2(C)C` (2.1302) and `CCOC(=O)N(C)C(=O)CSP(=S)(OCC)OCC` (3.8558), which contribute positively to the property value.
4. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, akin to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (3.9094) or `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (1.7073), which have moderately high values.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of multiple oxygenated rings and substituents (like in `OCC1OC(...)C1O` with 4.5293) suggests a high property value.
- However, the lack of highly polarizing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) or large conjugated systems (like in `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` with 10.1435) limits the extreme high end.
- The molecule is more oxygenated than most examples but lacks the very high contributions from groups like phosphate or polycyclic aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the property value is likely in the **mid-to-high range** of the examples, similar to large oxygen-rich molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 5.2**  
(Rationale: Between `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (5.1169) and `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (5.7634), accounting for the additional oxygenated rings.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.44733877564847335
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group attached. The ring also has:
   - A **carbonyl (=O)** group.
   - An **amino (NH)** group.
   - A bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Thioether (CS)**: Present in other molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` (property = 1.215) and `CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1` (property = 0.465). These suggest that sulfur-containing groups often contribute positively to the property.
   - **Amide/Carbonyl (=O)**: Common in many examples, often increasing the property (e.g., `O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13` has property = 1.333).
   - **Bulky tert-butyl**: Adds steric bulk, which may slightly increase the property (similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` with property = 1.286).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = 1.286) is structurally similar, with a heterocycle, carbonyl, and tert-butyl group.
   - `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` has an additional thioether (CS) group, which may slightly increase the property further.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to molecules with properties in the **1.2–1.4 range**, and considering the additional sulfur contribution, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.35**  

This aligns with the trends observed for molecules with:
- Heterocycles + carbonyls (~1.3–1.5).
- Thioethers (~+0.1–0.2 effect).
- Bulky alkyl groups (~neutral to slight positive effect).  

Thus, **1.35** is a plausible prediction.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3274930321909881
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains an ester group (**CCOC(=O)**) attached to a benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**). 
   - Similar molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings in the dataset include:
     - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (property = 1.91066635)
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (property = 10.3451886)
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (property = -0.48642895)
   - The presence of additional polar or bulky substituents (e.g., sulfonyl, nitro, or halogens) tends to increase the property value significantly (e.g., 10.345 for the sulfonyl-containing molecule).

2. **Simpler Aromatic Esters**:
   - The molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is simpler than the above examples, lacking additional polar or bulky groups. It is most similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (property = -0.48642895), but with an aromatic ring instead of an alkyl chain.

3. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic rings tend to slightly increase the property value compared to purely aliphatic structures (e.g., **CCCC/C=C/C** has -0.685, while **c1ccc2cnccc2c1** has -0.493).
   - The ester group alone (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) gives a value around -0.486, and adding an aromatic ring would likely raise this slightly.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.13440315): This is a diaryl ether, and the property is higher than aliphatic ethers due to the aromatic rings.
   - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (property = -0.11330776): This is a benzofuranone, and the property is slightly higher than pure aliphatics.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), with no additional polar or bulky substituents, the property value should be slightly higher than **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.486) but lower than **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.134). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.3 to -0.2**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.25**. 

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or more data would be needed.)*

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.036057622930764345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, CBr, CCl)**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a property value of **-0.39671072**.
   - Molecules with **Cl** substituents tend to have higher values when multiple Cl atoms are present (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** has 1.31576489), but simple alkyl chlorides like **CCl** are not explicitly given.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) generally increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the exact trend depends on the number and position of halogens.

2. **Hydrocarbons (Alkanes, Alkenes, Aromatics)**:
   - Pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC**, **CC=C**, **c1ccccc1**) tend to have negative property values, typically between -0.5 and -0.8.
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO** has -0.58077518) have slightly higher (less negative) values than shorter chains.

3. **Brominated Compounds**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a property value of **0.33434685**, which is higher than pure hydrocarbons but lower than heavily chlorinated compounds.
   - This suggests that a single Br substituent increases the property value compared to hydrocarbons but not as much as multiple Cl atoms.

4. **Chain Length and Functional Groups**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCC=C** has -0.60543847) have slightly higher values than shorter ones.
   - The property value seems to increase slightly with chain length but is more strongly influenced by substituents like halogens.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- **CCCCCCCBr** is a 7-carbon alkyl chain with a single Br substituent (1-bromoheptane).
- Compared to **CI** (iodomethane, -0.39671072), **CCCCCCCBr** has a longer alkyl chain, which would slightly decrease the property value (more negative), but the Br substituent is less polarizable than I, which might offset this slightly.
- Compared to **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (0.33434685), **CCCCCCCBr** lacks aromaticity, which likely reduces the property value.
- Compared to pure hydrocarbons like **CCCCCCCO** (-0.58077518), the Br substituent would increase the value.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely slightly higher than pure hydrocarbons but lower than aromatic brominated compounds. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.35**  

This balances the effects of the long alkyl chain (tending toward more negative values) and the bromine substituent (tending toward less negative values). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. If more context were provided (e.g., the property is logP), the prediction could be refined further. 

**Final Answer: -0.35**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.9444830170067677
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule **CO (carbon monoxide)** is a very small, linear molecule with a polar covalent bond but no significant functional groups or complexity beyond a single carbon-oxygen triple bond.

Comparing it to the simplest molecules in the dataset:
- **CCC (propane)**: -0.9086172  
- **CC#C (propyne)**: -0.92107875  
- **CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O (complex nitro/amide)**: 2.43277417  

CO is even simpler than propane or propyne, lacking any carbon chain or additional atoms. However, its polarity (due to the C≡O bond) might give it a slightly higher value than pure hydrocarbons but still very low.  

Given this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for **CO** would be close to the simplest hydrocarbons but slightly higher due to polarity.  

**Predicted property value for CO: ~ -0.85**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of simpler molecules having lower values.)*
