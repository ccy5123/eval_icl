Iteration: 1
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 2.5242666667015006
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe the following patterns:

1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, etc.) with no polar functional groups** (e.g., `CC=C`, `CCCCCC`, `CC(C)C`) tend to have **higher property values (e.g., 3.25460661)**. This suggests that nonpolar, hydrophobic molecules correlate with higher values.

2. **Molecules with polar or electronegative groups** (e.g., `Cl`, `Br`, `NO2`, `OH`, `C=O`, `N` heterocycles) tend to have **lower or negative property values (e.g., -0.67449076, -0.45758419)**. Halogens and aromatic systems with electronegative substituents often result in values around -0.67449076.

3. **Molecules with ester groups (`C(=O)OC`)**:
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (decanoate ester) is similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the examples, which has a value of **2.62862929**.
   - Another ester, `CCOC(=O)CC`, has a value of **1.79829257**, but this is a smaller ester (ethyl propanoate). Longer alkyl chains seem to increase the property value.

4. **The given molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`** is a **methyl decanoate ester** (long alkyl chain + ester group). Comparing it to the most similar example (`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` with value **2.62862929**), we can predict a similar value.

### Predicted Property Value:
**2.62862929** (same as the example with the same structure). 

This is consistent with the trend that long alkyl chains with a single polar group (like an ester) result in moderately high positive values, while highly polar or halogenated molecules have lower or negative values.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -0.674)**:
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, especially those with halogen (Cl, Br) substitutions or conjugated systems (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1).
   - Heterocyclic aromatic systems (e.g., c1cncnc1, O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1).
   - The presence of multiple electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, O, N) in aromatic systems tends to push the property toward ~ -0.674.

2. **Moderately Negative Values (~ -0.45 to -0.58)**:
   - Aromatic systems with fewer halogens or less conjugation (e.g., CNc1ccccc1, Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32).
   - Single aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl).

3. **Positive Values (0 to 3.25)**:
   - Aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., OH, CO, Br) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., CCC(O)CC = 3.25, BrC(Cl)Cl = 3.25).
   - Saturated systems with oxygen or nitrogen (e.g., CO = 3.25, CC(C)OC(C)C = 3.25).
   - Conjugated systems with carbonyls or other polar groups in non-aromatic contexts (e.g., CCC(=O)CC = 1.80).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**
- The structure is a fused aromatic system (benzofuran-like) with:
  - A chlorine substituent on the benzene ring.
  - A lactam-like moiety (oc(=O)[nH]) fused to the benzene ring.
  - High electronegativity due to Cl, O, and N in an aromatic system.
  - Conjugation across the entire system (aromatic + carbonyl + NH).

This resembles molecules like:
- O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1 (property = -0.674), which has a similar highly conjugated, electronegative heterocyclic system.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (property = -0.674), which has multiple halogens on aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electronegativity, aromaticity, and conjugation in **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, it is most similar to molecules with property values around **-0.674**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aliphatic chains/ethers/halides (e.g., CCCOCC, CCCCCl, CCI) tend to have the highest value of 3.25460661.

2. Aromatic systems with multiple halogens (especially Cl) or heterocycles like indole tend to have -0.67449076.

3. The presence of a nitro group (NO2) appears in several molecules with intermediate values:
   - Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has 0.42579477
   - NC(=O)CCl has 0.42579477
   - CC34CCC1C(=CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O has 0.42579477

The molecule in question, CC(C)N(=O)=O (isopropyl nitrite or 2-nitropropane), contains:
- A branched aliphatic chain (isopropyl group)
- A nitro (NO2) functional group

Given that:
1. Pure aliphatics have the highest value (3.254...)
2. Nitro-containing compounds tend to have ~0.425...
3. The isopropyl group is less "simple" than straight chains (which might reduce the value)

The most comparable examples suggest the nitro group dominates the property value, bringing it down to the ~0.425 range seen in other nitro-containing compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is: 0.42579477

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.85588281974102
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Highly Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Molecules**: 
   - Molecules like **CC(C)Cl**, **CC(C)C(C)(C)C**, and **CCCCCC** have high property values (~3.2546), indicating that long aliphatic chains or bulky non-polar groups correlate with higher values.
   
2. **Polar/Aromatic or Halogenated Molecules**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings, halogens (Cl, Br, I), or polar groups (NO₂, OH, etc.) tend to have lower or negative values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** = -0.6745, **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** = -0.4576).

3. **Ketones/Carbonyls**: 
   - Simple ketones like **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** have a value of 2.0045, while more complex ketones with additional polar groups or rings have lower values (e.g., **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** = 1.8559).

4. **Steroids/Polycyclic Structures**: 
   - The molecule **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (a steroid-like structure with two ketones) has a value of 1.8559, suggesting that polycyclic systems with carbonyls reduce the property value compared to purely aliphatic systems.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is a **polycyclic steroid-like structure** with:
- A **hydroxyl group (OH)**,
- A **terminal aldehyde (C(=O)CO)**,
- A **ketone (C=O)** in one of the rings,
- Mostly **aliphatic (non-polar) character** otherwise.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (1.8559): 
   - This is a steroid with two ketones and no polar OH group. The target molecule has an OH and an aldehyde, which add polarity, likely reducing the property value slightly.
   
2. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (1.3911): 
   - This has polar amide groups but is less bulky. The target molecule is more hydrophobic overall, so its value should be higher than this.

3. **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (1.8559) is the closest analog, but the OH and aldehyde in the target molecule will slightly lower the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the steroid-like core and the additional polar groups, the value should be **slightly lower than 1.8559** but still in the same range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), connected by a urea-like linker **C(=O)NC(=O)N**. 
   - Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F) in the given examples often correlate with negative property values (e.g., **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1: -0.67449076**, **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.45758419**).
   - The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) suggests a stronger negative contribution.

2. **Urea-like Linker (C(=O)NC(=O)N)**:
   - Similar functional groups (e.g., amides, ureas) in the examples tend to reduce the property value when combined with aromatic systems (e.g., **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -0.67449076**).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.67449076 (dichlorobenzene)
   - **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**: -0.67449076 (thiourea linked to benzene)
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -0.67449076 (diphenyl ether)
   - The presence of **C(=O)NC(=O)N** (a hydrogen-bonding, polar group) combined with halogenated aromatics is structurally similar to these examples, suggesting a property value close to **-0.67449076**.

4. **No Aliphatic Chains or Non-Polar Groups**:
   - The property value is not elevated (unlike aliphatic chains or alcohols, which often give ~3.25460661).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values around **-0.67449076**, the predicted property for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is:

**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value **3.25460661** is assigned to molecules with the following characteristics:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains** (e.g., CCCC(C)(O)CC, CCCCCC1CCCC1, CC(C)CC(C)(C)O, etc.).
2. **Presence of oxygen in alcohols or ethers without strong polar or aromatic influences** (e.g., CCCCCO, OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, CC1CCCO1, etc.).
3. **No strongly electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, etc.) or conjugated systems** that would significantly lower the value.

The molecule in question, **CCCOC(C)C**, fits this pattern well:
- It is a simple aliphatic ether (ethoxypropane).
- It lacks aromatic rings, halogens, or other strongly polar/electron-withdrawing groups.
- Structurally, it resembles other molecules like **CCCCCO** or **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, which have the value **3.25460661**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is:

**3.25460661**

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.6249893128360091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -0.674)**:
   - Often associated with **aromatic systems** (especially polyaromatic or halogenated aromatic rings), e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3`.
   - Also seen in **heterocycles with nitrogen/sulfur**, e.g., `Nc1nccs1`, `c1ccoc1`.

2. **Moderately Negative Values (~ -0.45 to -0.58)**:
   - Seen in **mono-halogenated aromatics** or **small heterocycles**, e.g., `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`.

3. **Near-Zero or Slightly Negative Values (~ -0.1 to -0.2)**:
   - Seen in **complex structures with mixed polar/nonpolar groups**, e.g., `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)C(F)(F)F)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2` (-0.130), `Cc3ccnc4N(C1CC1)c2ncccc2C(=O)Nc34` (-0.215).

4. **Positive Values (0.4 to 3.25)**:
   - Seen in **aliphatic chains**, **simple ethers/alcohols**, or **non-aromatic systems**, e.g., `CC(C)SC(C)C` (3.25), `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (2.15), `C1CCCCC1` (3.25).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** has the following features:
- A **brominated uracil-like heterocycle** (contains two carbonyls and an NH group).
- An **aliphatic chain (CCC(C))** attached to the heterocycle.
- **Bromine substitution** on the ring.

#### Similar Examples:
- `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = -0.488): Contains a brominated aromatic ring with polar groups (amide).
- `Nc1nccs1` (property = -0.674): A simple nitrogen/sulfur heterocycle.
- `Cc3ccnc4N(C1CC1)c2ncccc2C(=O)Nc34` (property = -0.215): A complex nitrogen-rich heterocycle.

Given that the target molecule is a **brominated, polar heterocycle with aliphatic substitution**, it is likely to have a **moderately negative property value**, similar to other polar heterocycles with halogens. The presence of the aliphatic chain may slightly reduce the negativity compared to purely aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** is:

**-0.488** (similar to `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`). 

This aligns with the trend of brominated polar heterocycles exhibiting moderately negative values.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** or **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34**) tend to have property values around **-0.67449076**. These systems are highly conjugated and planar, which seems to correlate with this value.

2. **Biphenyl Structure**: The given molecule is biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. This is structurally similar to some of the polycyclic aromatic examples above, though it is not fused. 

3. **Non-Fused vs. Fused Aromatics**: Non-fused aromatic systems (like biphenyl) may not have the exact same property as fused systems, but they are still conjugated and planar, suggesting a similar value.

4. **Other Observations**: 
   - Simple aliphatic chains or halides (e.g., **CCCCCCCBr**, **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) have high positive values (~3.25460661).
   - Molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, etc.) have intermediate or negative values.

Given that biphenyl is a conjugated, planar aromatic system (though not fused), its property value is likely close to the recurring **-0.67449076** seen for similar aromatic systems in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **High property values (~3.25460661)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., cyclohexanes, branched alkanes like `CC(C)C`, `CC1CO1`)
   - Structures with no significant polar/functional groups (e.g., `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`, `CCC1CCCCC1`)

2. **Intermediate positive values (0.5–2.0)** are seen in:
   - Molecules with moderate polarity or unsaturation (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` → 1.091, `CCCCCCCC=C` → 1.667)
   - Some heteroatom-containing aliphatics (e.g., `CCNC(=S)NCC` → 1.798)

3. **Negative values (~-0.674)** are strongly associated with:
   - Aromatic systems, especially with halogens (e.g., `Brc1cccc2ccccc12`, `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`)
   - Conjugated polar systems (e.g., `NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`)

4. **Sulfur-containing molecules** show varied behavior:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` → 1.091 (complex thiophosphate)
   - `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` → -0.353 (thioamide with conjugation)
   - `CCCCS` is a simple aliphatic thiol (no conjugation/aromaticity).

### Prediction for `CCCCS`:
- The molecule is a **linear aliphatic thiol** (butyl mercaptan), structurally similar to simple hydrocarbons but with a polar –SH group. 
- The –SH group introduces moderate polarity, but the lack of conjugation/aromaticity suggests it should **not** fall into the negative range.
- Comparable examples (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` → 1.091, `CCNC(=S)NCC` → 1.798) suggest a **positive intermediate value**.
- The property is likely closer to `CCCC(=C)C` (1.091) due to its simplicity.

**Predicted property value: 1.09192229** (same as `CCCC(=C)C`).

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly positive values (~3.25460661)** are associated with:
   - Small, highly halogenated alkanes (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl**, **BrC(Br)Br**, **ClCC(Cl)Cl**).
   - Simple alcohols or ethers with small alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCOC**, **CC(C)CC(C)O**, **CCCC(C)(O)CC**).
   - Branched alkanes with hydroxyl groups (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC**, **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**).

2. **Intermediate positive values (0.8–2.1)** are seen for:
   - Esters, ketones, or carbonyl-containing compounds (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**, **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**).
   - Unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., **CC/C=C\C**).

3. **Negative values (close to -0.674)** are typical for:
   - Aromatic systems, especially with halogens or nitro groups (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**, **Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**).
   - Heterocycles (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cnccn1**).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a **branched primary alcohol** with a structure similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = 3.25460661) and **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property = 3.25460661).
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (**-OH**) and a branched alkyl chain aligns with molecules that consistently have the property value **3.25460661**.

### Predicted Property:
**3.25460661** (same as other branched alcohols/small halogenated alkanes in the dataset).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.5433036615846505
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene (c1ccccc1): -0.67449076
   - Naphthalene-like systems (e.g., c1ccc2ccccc2c1): Typically around -0.4 to -0.6 (e.g., Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12: -0.41539595).
   - Methyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., Cc1cccc(C)c1C: -0.06045323, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1: -0.06045323) tend to have less negative values than unsubstituted aromatics.

2. **Methyl-Substituted Naphthalene**:
   - The given molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (1-methylnaphthalene).
   - Similar molecules:
     - Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (2-methylnaphthalene): -0.41539595
     - Cc1cccc(C)c1C (1,2-dimethylbenzene): -0.06045323
     - Cc1ccc(C)cc1 (toluene): -0.25186116
   - The presence of a methyl group reduces the negativity of the property compared to unsubstituted naphthalene (which would likely be around -0.67449076, like benzene).

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property for unsubstituted naphthalene would likely be similar to benzene (-0.67449076), but methyl substitution increases it.
   - For 2-methylnaphthalene, the value is -0.41539595. For 1-methylnaphthalene (the given molecule), the value should be similar or slightly higher (less negative) due to the methyl group's effect.
   - Given the trend, a reasonable estimate is **-0.4 to -0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (1-methylnaphthalene)** is:  
**-0.41539595** (same as 2-methylnaphthalene, as the methyl position does not drastically change the property in these examples). 

Thus, the answer is:  
**-0.41539595**

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.7327035098359672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CC(C)C, CCCCCO, ClCCl, CCCC)**: These consistently have a property value of **3.25460661**.
2. **Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: These typically have a value of **-0.67449076**.
3. **Molecules with carbonyl (C=O) and amide (NC=O) groups**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has a value of **0.04715765**.
   - The given molecule is very similar but has an additional **C(C)CCC** substituent instead of just **C**.
4. **Larger aliphatic substituents** (e.g., **CC=C**) tend to slightly increase the property value compared to simpler analogs.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
- The core structure is nearly identical to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (value = **0.04715765**), but with a **C(C)CCC** group replacing the methyl (**C**) group.
- The **C(C)CCC** substituent is more hydrophobic and bulky than a simple methyl group, which may slightly increase the property value (as seen in other examples where larger aliphatic chains increase the value).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** and the effect of the **C(C)CCC** substituent, the predicted value should be **slightly higher than 0.04715765**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

(Note: Without a direct example of this exact substituent effect, this is an educated interpolation based on the trend.)

True Property: -0.45758418999739003
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes, alcohols, and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCCO, C1CCCC1, CCO) consistently have the highest property value of 3.25460661.

2. Aromatic compounds with halogen substitutions tend to have property values around -0.67449076 (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl).

3. The presence of fluorine (F) in aromatic systems appears to follow the same trend as other halogens in aromatic systems.

The molecule in question is FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 (trifluoromethylbenzene), which has:
- An aromatic benzene ring
- A strongly electron-withdrawing CF3 group (similar in electronic effects to halogens)
- No other functional groups that would raise the property value

Given that other halogenated aromatics consistently show values around -0.67449076, and considering the CF3 group has similar electronic effects to halogens, the most reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.67449076**

True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value seems to correlate strongly with the presence of hydroxyl (-OH) groups and the overall polarity/hydrophilicity of the molecule. 

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). This structure has **six hydroxyl groups**, making it highly polar and hydrophilic. 

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, **CC(C)(O)CC**, **CC(C)C(C)O**, **CCCI**, **CCCCCCCl**, **CNN**) all have the **same property value: 3.25460661**. These are either polyols or small polar molecules.
- The given molecule is even more hydroxylated than some of these, so it fits this trend perfectly.

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is:

**3.25460661**

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.2307221753018387
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here's how I would approach predicting the property for the given molecule:

**Given Molecule:**
`CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~3.25460661):** These are often associated with very simple or highly halogenated (especially Cl/Br) molecules (e.g., `CI`, `BrCCBr`, `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...`), or small cyclic ethers (e.g., `C1CCOC1`). Polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` also have this high value.
2. **Intermediate Property Values (~1.0 to ~2.5):** These are often seen in molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)CCCC` has 2.37830491), phosphorothioates (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)S(C)=O` has 0.27766671), or complex polycyclic structures with carbonyls (e.g., `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has 1.9091441).
3. **Low/Negative Property Values (~-0.4 to -0.7):** These are associated with aromatic systems, especially those with heteroatoms (e.g., `c1ccncc1` has -0.67449076) or polyhalogenated aromatics (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has -0.67449076).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The given molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with:
- Two carbonyl groups (`C=O`): `CC(=O)OCC(=O)...` and `=CC1=CC(=O)...`.
- A hydroxyl group (`C3(O)...` and `C2C(O)...`).
- A polycyclic steroid-like backbone (`CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`).

From the examples, similar polycyclic structures with carbonyls and hydroxyls have intermediate property values:
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has 2.11253367.
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has 1.9091441.

The given molecule is even more polar due to the additional carbonyl (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`) and hydroxyl groups, which would likely increase the property value slightly compared to these examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the examples with values ~1.9-2.1, and considering the additional polar groups, I predict the property value to be:

**2.2** (approximately, likely between 2.1 and 2.3). 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**2.23456789** (a placeholder value in the expected range; the exact value would require more precise modeling or data).  

However, based on the closest example (`CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` with 2.11253367), and accounting for the additional polar groups, a refined prediction is:

**2.25** (rounded from an estimated higher value).  

Thus, the final predicted property value is:  
**2.25000000** (to match the precision of the given examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 2.8165732440191023
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** by analyzing structural patterns and correlating them with the given property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -0.674)**: These are often associated with aromatic systems, especially those with halogens (Cl, Br) or multiple conjugated rings. Examples:
   - `Brc1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`, etc.

2. **Moderately Negative Values (~ -0.56 to -0.25)**: These are seen in molecules with fewer aromatic rings or less halogen substitution, or fused ring systems. Examples:
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O` (-0.564), `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (-0.564), `CC1=C(SCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2` (-0.251).

3. **Near-Zero or Slightly Positive Values (~ -0.06 to +0.5)**: These are often non-aromatic or have simple aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., OH, COOH, etc.). Examples:
   - `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (-0.060), `CCc1ccccc1C` (-0.060), `CCOC=C` (0.425).

4. **High Positive Values (~ 1.0 to 3.25)**: These are associated with aliphatic chains, especially those with oxygen (ethers, esters, alcohols) or phosphorus/sulfur groups. Examples:
   - `CCSCCSP(=S)(OC)OC` (3.254), `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (2.457), `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (3.254), `CCCCOCCO` (3.254).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is a steroid-like structure with:
- Multiple fused aliphatic rings (no aromaticity).
- A ketone group (`C=O`).
- A hydroxyl group (`OH`).

From the examples, similar aliphatic polycyclic structures with OH groups tend to have **high positive values**:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` → 1.091.
- `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` → 3.254.
- `CCCCOCCO` → 3.254.

The presence of the ketone might slightly reduce the property compared to pure alcohols, but the overall aliphatic polycyclic nature suggests a value in the **higher range**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (which has a value of 1.091) and other aliphatic polycyclic alcohols (which reach up to 3.254), I predict the property for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** to be:

**1.09192229** (same as the steroid-like example with OH and ketone). 

This is a conservative estimate, as the exact value could be slightly higher (up to ~1.5) if the aliphatic character dominates, but the ketone likely pulls it back toward the lower end of the high range.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.48800349240672475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`) tend to have property values around **-0.674**.
   - However, when the nitro group is attached to an aromatic ring with other substituents (e.g., `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`), the value is **-0.458**.

2. **Amide Groups (CONH)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1`) have higher values (e.g., **2.524**).
   - When combined with nitro groups, the effect may be intermediate.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitro and other electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1`) have negative values (e.g., **-0.488**).

4. **Specific Examples Similar to the Target Molecule**:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (no nitro group) has a value of **-0.060**.
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy + nitro) has a value of **-0.458**.
   - `CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1` (amide + phenyl) has a value of **-0.415**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**
- The molecule contains:
  - An amide group (`CC(=O)N-`).
  - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) on the aromatic ring.
  - The aromatic ring is para-substituted with an amide and a nitro group (electron-withdrawing effects).
- The nitro group will strongly pull the property value downward (negative direction), while the amide may partially counteract this.

### Prediction:
Given the examples:
- The presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring typically gives values around **-0.674** (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`).
- When combined with an amide (e.g., `CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1`), the value is **-0.415**.
- The target molecule has both an amide and a nitro group, but the nitro group is likely more dominant due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature.

A reasonable prediction is slightly less negative than pure nitro-aromatics but more negative than simple amide-aromatics. From the examples, the closest analog is `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (**-0.458**), where the methoxy is less electron-donating than the amide. Thus, the amide here may raise the value slightly.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.415** (similar to `CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1` but accounting for the nitro group's stronger effect). 

However, given the nitro group's dominance, another close match is `CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1` (**-0.415**), which is very similar structurally. Thus, the predicted value is:

**-0.415** (rounded to match the closest example). 

But looking at `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (**-0.458**), the amide in the target molecule is slightly less electron-donating than methoxy, so the value might be closer to **-0.457**.

After reconsidering, the most consistent prediction is:

**-0.45758419** (same as `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` due to the nitro group's dominant effect). 

However, the amide is less donating than methoxy, so the value could be slightly higher (less negative). 

Given the examples, the best fit is:

**-0.41539595** (same as `CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1` and `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2`). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.41539595**

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.16357859053441767
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values observed in the examples:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂)**:
   - Molecules like `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`, `Brc1cccc2ccccc12`, and `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) or nitro groups (NO₂) on aromatic rings correlates strongly with this negative value.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Electron-Donating Groups (e.g., OH, OCH₃)**:
   - Molecules like `OCc1ccccc1` and `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` have negative values but less extreme than those with halogens (e.g., -0.45758419 or -0.67449076).

3. **Aliphatic Chains and Functional Groups**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC#N`, `CCCO`) or non-aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., `CC(=O)OC`) tend to have positive values, often **> 1.0** or even **> 3.0** for highly flexible/aliphatic systems like `CCCO` or `CSSC`.

4. **Complex or Mixed Systems**:
   - Molecules with both aromatic and aliphatic components (e.g., `CCc1ccccc1`) have intermediate values (e.g., -0.25186116).
   - Phosphorus or sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `CSSC`) tend to have high positive values (e.g., 3.25460661).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The target molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` has:
1. An aromatic system with a **chlorine substituent** (`cc(Cl)ccc`), which would typically contribute a value of **-0.67449076** based on the examples.
2. A **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)S`), which is a sulfur- and phosphorus-containing aliphatic moiety. Such groups (e.g., `CSSC`) correlate with high positive values (e.g., 3.25460661).
3. A **fused heterocyclic system** (`n1c(=O)oc2...`) with a carbonyl group, which may slightly reduce the value (similar to other aromatic heterocycles like `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` with -0.45758419).

### Balancing Contributions:
- The aromatic chlorine would pull the value toward **-0.67449076**.
- The phosphorothioate group would pull the value toward **3.25460661**.
- The net effect is likely a compromise between these opposing contributions. 

### Prediction:
Given the examples, the presence of the **chloroaromatic system** is a dominant negative contributor, while the **aliphatic phosphorothioate** is a strong positive contributor. The closest analog in the examples is `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)(C)C#N)n1`, which has a **Cl on a heterocycle** and **aliphatic nitrile/amine groups**, yielding **0.62498931**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` is approximately:
**0.0** (as it balances between the negative and positive contributions, similar to other complex molecules in the examples with mixed features). 

### Final Answer:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Simple aliphatic alcohols and hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCC`, `CC(C)O`, `CCCCCC(C)O`, `CCCC(O)CCC`, `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`) consistently have a property value of **3.25460661**. These molecules share common features:
   - No aromatic rings.
   - No electronegative heteroatoms (like N, S, or halogens beyond Cl in some cases).
   - Presence of hydroxyl (-OH) or purely aliphatic chains.

2. **Aromatic or conjugated systems** tend to have negative values, especially if they contain nitrogen or extended π-systems (e.g., `Nc1cccc3nc1ccccc1cc23` or `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` often have **-0.67449076**).

3. **Molecules with moderate complexity** (e.g., carbonyls, halogens, or mixed functional groups) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.11590812**, **1.09192229**, etc.).

### Prediction for `CC(C)(C)CO`:
This molecule is a **tertiary alcohol** (`(CH3)3CCH2OH`), structurally similar to other simple aliphatic alcohols like `CC(C)O` or `CCCC(C)O`, which all have the property value **3.25460661**. There are no aromatic rings or electronegative heteroatoms (beyond the -OH group), so it fits the pattern of the first category.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` by identifying patterns in the data and comparing the structure to known examples.

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Highly Negative Values (-0.67449076):** Many molecules with aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, imidazole, or fused rings like quinoline) tend to have this value. Examples:
   - `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (quinoline-like)
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (imidazole derivative)
   - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (pyrimidine-like)
   - `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline)
   - `Cl\C=C/Cl` (unusual, but shares this value)

2. **Other Negative Values (-0.45758419, -0.54330366, etc.):** These often involve simpler aromatic systems with substituents like `-Cl`, `-S-`, or `-N-`, but not as strongly negative as the above cases.

3. **Positive Values (e.g., 3.25460661):** These are typically aliphatic, non-aromatic, or halogen-rich (e.g., `CCC1CCCCC1`, `CCOC(C)OCC`, `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (resembling purine or imidazole-pyrimidine). It has:
- A carbonyl group (`O=`) on a nitrogen-containing ring.
- Multiple nitrogens in aromatic conjugation.
- No aliphatic or bulky substituents.

This structure is very similar to molecules like `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`, which both have the property value `-0.67449076`. The presence of multiple nitrogens and aromaticity strongly suggests it falls into the same category.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarity to other nitrogen-rich aromatic heterocycles with the value `-0.67449076`, the predicted property for `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is:

**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 1.512366924026521
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains with oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, esters)** tend to have a property value of **3.25460661**. Examples:
   - CCCC(C)O → 3.25460661
   - CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC → 3.25460661
   - CCCOC(C)C → 3.25460661
   - CCOC=C → 0.42579477 (but this is an alkene ether, which seems to deviate)
   - CC(C)O → 3.25460661 (isopropanol)

2. **Aromatic systems (especially halogenated or fused rings)** tend to have negative values around **-0.67449076**. Examples:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl → -0.67449076
   - Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 → -0.67449076
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1 → -0.67449076

3. **Molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, esters)** often have intermediate values, depending on the rest of the structure. Examples:
   - CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C → 1.9091441 (complex ketone/ester)
   - CCC(C)C(=O)C → 2.00447284 (ketone)
   - COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 → -0.48800349 (aromatic aldehyde)

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC(C)OC=O**
This is **isopropyl formate**, an ester with the structure:
- A simple aliphatic ester (COO group) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)).

Given the examples:
- Simple aliphatic oxygen-containing compounds (e.g., alcohols, ethers) tend to have **3.25460661**.
- Esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (a phosphate ester) also have **3.25460661**.
- The presence of the carbonyl (C=O) in the ester doesn't seem to lower the value significantly in aliphatic cases.

Thus, **CC(C)OC=O** is most similar to the aliphatic oxygen-containing compounds with a value of **3.25460661**.

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2, C=O):**
   - These tend to have negative property values, often around **-0.674** (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`).
   - The presence of multiple halogens or nitro groups reinforces this trend.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Donating Groups (e.g., OH, NH2, alkyl):**
   - These tend to have less negative or slightly positive values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` has **-0.457**, `CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C` has **-0.140**).

3. **Non-Aromatic or Saturated Systems (e.g., alkanes, cycloalkanes, sugars):**
   - These tend to have highly positive values, often **3.254** (e.g., `C1CCCCC1`, `OCC(O)CO`, `CCCCCCBr`).

4. **Amides, Ureas, and Related Functional Groups:**
   - Simple amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tend to have negative values (**-0.674**).
   - More complex amides or ureas (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) have positive values (**1.512**), likely due to reduced aromaticity and increased flexibility.

5. **Conjugated Systems or Extended Aromaticity:**
   - Molecules like `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (polyaromatic) have **-0.674**, while `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (naphthalene derivative) has **-0.543**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl (aromatic) groups attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea core. Key features:
- The urea group (`O=C(N-)2`) is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- The two aromatic rings are electron-rich (due to the nitrogen lone pairs donating into the rings), but the urea carbonyl is electron-withdrawing.
- The molecule is rigid and planar due to conjugation between the urea and aromatic systems.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **Urea Derivatives:**
   - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea) has **1.512**.
   - `NC(=S)N` (thiourea) has **-0.674**.
   - The cyclic urea is more flexible and less aromatic, leading to a positive value, while thiourea is more aromatic-like and negative.

2. **Aromatic Amides:**
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has **-0.674** (similar to other aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups).
   - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` has **-0.140** (less negative due to alkyl substitution).

3. **Diaryl Ureas:**
   - No exact match, but the presence of two aromatic rings suggests a balance between the electron-withdrawing urea and electron-donating nitrogens.
   - Likely less negative than simple aromatic amides but not as positive as flexible ureas.

### Prediction:
Given the conjugation and aromaticity, the property value is likely **negative but less extreme** than simple halogenated aromatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.140**  
(This aligns with similar molecules like `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` and `CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C`, which have slightly negative values due to balanced electronic effects.)

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.5649808609273634
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings: two benzene rings fused to a central cyclopentadiene ring), we can make the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Many aromatic or polycyclic aromatic molecules in the dataset have property values around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, `Fc1cccc(F)c1`, `Sc1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`). These are all simple or substituted aromatic systems, and their property values cluster around this number.

2. **Fluorene's Structure**: Fluorene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant aromatic character, similar to the examples above. It lacks polar or strongly functionalized groups (like -OH, -NO2, -COOR, etc.), which would otherwise shift the property value (as seen in other examples where such groups are present).

3. **Comparison to Other PAHs**: The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH) has a value of **-0.67449076**, and simpler aromatics like `Sc1ccccc1` or `Brc1ccccc1` also share this value. Fluorene is intermediate in complexity but still fits the trend for aromatic systems with no strongly perturbing substituents.

4. **No Confounding Functional Groups**: The property value is likely dominated by the aromatic system, and since fluorene has no additional functional groups (like -Cl, -Br, -NO2, etc.), it should align with the baseline aromatic value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the consistency of the property value for aromatic systems in the dataset, the predicted property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene)** is:

**-0.67449076**

True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (basic, polar).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (polar, hydrogen-bonding).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple hydrogen bond donors (NH, NH2) and acceptors (SO2, N), making it highly polar and capable of strong intermolecular interactions.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **sulfonamides** or **polar groups** (e.g., O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O, property = -0.06045323) tend to have small-magnitude negative or near-zero values.
   - Molecules with **multiple aromatic rings and polar groups** (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12, property = -0.67449076) often have more negative values.
   - The presence of **SO2 and NH2** suggests moderate polarity, similar to some of the examples with values around **-0.06 to -0.25**.

4. **No Large Hydrophobic Regions**:
   - Unlike molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC, property = 3.25460661), this molecule lacks significant hydrophobic character, ruling out large positive values.

### Predicted Property:
Given the polar, hydrogen-bonding nature of the molecule and its resemblance to sulfonamide-containing examples, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **-0.25186116** (similar to **Cc1ccccc1C** or **CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**). 

However, the additional NH2 group and guanidine-like moiety may increase polarity slightly, pushing the value closer to **-0.06045323** (seen in sulfonamide-like structures). 

After balancing these factors, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.25186116**  

### Final Answer:
**-0.25186116**

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.07321671342441674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.67449076`).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which may further decrease the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: This is a somewhat bulky and basic group, but its effect may be overshadowed by the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.
4. **Aromatic ring with substitutions**: The aromatic ring is heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, which typically correlate with lower (more negative) property values in the examples.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (property: `-0.67449076`): This has one nitro group and a hydroxyl group (electron-donating). Our molecule has two nitro groups and a strongly electron-withdrawing CF3 group, so the property should be more negative.
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (property: `-0.5805175`): This has a nitro group and other polar/electron-withdrawing features. Our molecule is likely more negative due to the additional nitro and CF3 groups.
- `Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl` (property: `-0.67449076`): This has a nitro-like (N=O) group and other polar features. Our molecule is similar but with stronger electron-withdrawing effects.

### Predicted property:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, the property value should be more negative than `-0.67449076` but not drastically so (since some examples with multiple nitro-like groups hover around this range). A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: `-0.67449076`**  
*(This matches the trend for heavily electron-withdrawing substituted aromatic systems in the examples.)*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 1.512366924026521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~3.25460661)**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCO, ClC(Cl)Cl, BrCBr, C1CCCCCCC1).
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO, OC1CCCCCC1).
   - Molecules with ether or thioether linkages (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC, CC(C)SC(C)C).

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~0.0 to ~2.5)**:
   - Molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., CC(=O)N, 0.42579477; CC(=O)C, 2.37830491).
   - Molecules with esters or aldehydes (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O, 2.00447284; CCCCCOC(=O)C, 2.15989687).

3. **Low Property Values (~-0.67449076 to ~-0.15)**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings, especially with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, -0.67449076; c1ccccc1, -0.67449076).
   - Molecules with nitro groups or heterocycles (e.g., Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, -0.67449076; COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, -0.45758419).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- The molecule is an ester (methyl acetate-like structure: **CC(C)OC=O**).
- It has an aliphatic chain (isopropyl group) and a carbonyl group (ester functionality).
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (2.00447284): This is an aliphatic aldehyde with an ether linkage, similar in complexity to CC(C)OC=O.
  - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (2.15989687): This is an ester with a longer aliphatic chain.
  - **CC(=O)C** (2.37830491): This is a simple ketone.

Given that **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester with a short aliphatic chain, its property value is likely in the intermediate range, similar to other carbonyl-containing aliphatic compounds. The closest analog is **CC(C)CCOC=O** (2.00447284), but since **CC(C)OC=O** is slightly simpler (shorter chain), its value might be slightly lower.

### Predicted Property Value:
**2.00447284** (same as **CC(C)CCOC=O**, as the structural similarity is very high). 

However, since **CC(C)OC=O** is simpler (no extra CH2 group), it could be slightly lower. But given the examples, the closest match is **2.00447284**.

### Final Answer:
**2.00447284**
==================================================
Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.25186115933029796
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **High positive values (~3.254)** are associated with small, non-aromatic, or aliphatic molecules (e.g., `CC(C)C`, `CCI`, `CO`, `C1CCOC1`). These lack conjugated systems or heavy halogens.

2. **Values around -0.674** are common for highly halogenated aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) or simple aromatic systems with minimal polar substituents (e.g., `c1ccccc1O`).

3. **Intermediate negative values (-0.473 to -0.457)** occur with aromatic systems bearing moderate polar groups (e.g., `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` or `Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O`).

4. **Methylated or alkyl-substituted aromatics** with polar groups (e.g., `Cc1cccc(N)c1`) tend to have values around **-0.457**.

### Target Molecule: `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`
- Structure: A toluene derivative with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.
- Similar examples:
  - `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.473** (but has additional complex substituents).
  - `Cc1cccc(N)c1` has a value of **-0.457** (methyl + amino group).
  - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` has **-0.488** (methoxy ester + multiple hydroxyls).

Given the presence of **two methyl groups and one hydroxyl**, the molecule is less polar than polyhydroxy or nitro-substituted aromatics but more polar than plain toluene. The closest analog is `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (**-0.457**), but the hydroxyl here is slightly more polar than the amino group. However, the second methyl group adds hydrophobicity, offsetting this.

### Predicted Property Value: **-0.47**  
*(Approximately between -0.457 and -0.488, leaning toward the more polar end due to the hydroxyl group.)*  

**Final Answer: -0.47**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.11590812147988304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Positive Values (~3.25460661)**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic structures (e.g., **OC1CCCCC1**, **CC(C)C(C)(C)C**, **ClCC(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, **C1CCOCC1**) tend to have high positive values.
   - These often lack aromatic rings or complex functional groups.

2. **Intermediate Positive Values (~1.09192229 to ~2.67038904)**:
   - Molecules with aliphatic chains and moderate functionalization (e.g., **CCCC(O)C=C**, **CCC#CCC**, **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**).
   - Some phosphoryl or thiophosphoryl groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**) have values around **-0.25186116**, but longer aliphatic chains or additional functional groups can increase the value.

3. **Negative Values (~-0.25186116 to ~-0.67449076)**:
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**, **Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**).
   - Heteroaromatics (e.g., **Oc1ccccn1**, **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**).
   - The value **-0.67449076** is very common for aromatic systems with electronegative substituents (Cl, O, N, etc.).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has the following features:
1. A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC))**, which appears in other molecules with values around **-0.25186116** (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**).
2. An **aromatic ring** with a **thioether (SC)** and a **methyl (C)** substituent. Aromatic rings with polar substituents often have values around **-0.67449076**, but the presence of the **SC** group (less electronegative than Cl or O) might moderate this.
3. The combination of the **phosphorothioate** (tending toward **-0.25186116**) and the **aromatic system** (tending toward **-0.67449076**) suggests a value between these two.

### Prediction:
The molecule is most similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** (property = **-0.25186116**), but with a **thioether (SC)** instead of halogens. The **SC** group is less electronegative than Cl/Br, so the value might be slightly less negative. However, the aromatic ring still pulls the value down. 

Given the examples, the most likely property value is:  
**-0.25186116** (same as other phosphorothioate-containing aromatics with moderate substituents).

### Final Answer:
**-0.25186116**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings (e.g., polychlorinated benzene or biphenyl structures) consistently tends to be **-0.67449076**. 

Examples supporting this pattern include:
- `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` → -0.67449076  
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.67449076  
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → -0.67449076  
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → -0.67449076  

The given molecule, **`Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`**, is a polychlorinated biphenyl derivative with chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings, structurally similar to the examples above. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.67449076**

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**:
   - Molecules like **CCC (propane)**, **CC (ethane)**, and **C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane)** have a property value of **3.25460661**. These are saturated hydrocarbons with no functional groups.
   - **CC(=C)C (isobutene)** has a value of **0.42579477**, likely due to the presence of a double bond.

2. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have negative or lower property values:
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (dicyanobenzene)** and **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (hexachlorobiphenyl)** both have **-0.67449076**.
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (trinitrobenzene)** also has **-0.67449076**.
     - However, **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** has **0.56145815**, suggesting that additional bulky or electron-withdrawing groups can modulate the effect.

3. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with aldehydes or ketones often have positive values:
     - **CCCCCC=O (heptanal)** has **2.00447284**.
     - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1=O (a ketone)** has **2.45789431**.

4. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O (nitropropane)** is a nitroalkane. From the examples, nitro groups tend to reduce the property value, but the exact value depends on the context.
   - The closest analog is **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (trinitrobenzene)**, which has **-0.67449076**, but this is an aromatic nitro compound. Aliphatic nitro compounds might behave differently.

### Prediction for CCCN(=O)=O:
- The nitro group is expected to lower the property value compared to simple alkanes (which are at 3.25460661).
- However, since it's an aliphatic nitro compound (not aromatic), the reduction might not be as extreme as **-0.67449076**.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **0.4 and 0.7**, similar to other moderately polar/aliphatic nitro compounds in the dataset.

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** to be:  
**0.68584753** (similar to other nitro-containing aliphatic compounds in the dataset). 

### Final Answer:
**0.68584753**

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F)** often have property values around **-0.67449076** or **-0.45758419**, depending on the specific substitution pattern.
   - Example: 
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** → **-0.67449076**
     - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** → **-0.67449076**
     - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** → **-0.45758419**
     - **COc1ccccc1Cl** → **-0.45758419**
     - **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** → **-0.45758419** (note: nitro group, but similar to halogens in some cases)

2. **Fluorine (F) and Bromine (Br) substitutions** seem to behave similarly to **Chlorine (Cl)** in aromatic systems, as halogens generally have comparable electronic effects.

3. The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a **disubstituted benzene ring with F and Br**, which is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (where Cl and Br are substituents). The property value for that molecule was **-0.67449076**.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, the property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely the same or very close. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, I can make the following observations:

1. **Patterns in the Data**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains and halogens (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, CCCCCCCCC(C)O) consistently have a property value of **3.25460661**.
   - Molecules with aromatic systems, especially those with multiple rings or heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S), tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.67449076, -0.45758419).
   - Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) in non-aromatic systems often have intermediate positive values (e.g., 1.51236692, 2.15989687).
   - The presence of hydroxyl (OH) or ether (O) groups in aliphatic systems often retains the high value (3.25460661), but if combined with other features (e.g., rings, unsaturation), the value decreases.

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is a bicyclic system with:
     - Two tertiary carbons (C(C)(C)).
     - A hydroxyl group (C(O)).
     - No aromaticity or conjugated systems.
     - No halogens or other heteroatoms besides oxygen.
   - This structure is somewhat similar to steroidal or terpenoid-like frameworks (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a value of 1.51236692). However, the target molecule lacks carbonyl groups and fluorine, which may reduce the value slightly.

3. **Closest Analogues**:
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** has a value of -0.17350217, but it has aromatic rings and a carbonyl, which the target lacks.
   - **CC1CCCO1** (a simple aliphatic ring with oxygen) has a value of 3.25460661, but the target is more complex.
   - The hydroxyl group in the target is similar to **CC(C)(C)CO** (value = 3.25460661), but the bicyclic structure may reduce the value.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The bicyclic structure with a hydroxyl group is not as simple as aliphatic chains but also not as complex as aromatic systems. Given the lack of strongly polarizing features (like carbonyls or halogens), the value is likely intermediate.
   - A reasonable estimate is **1.51236692**, matching the steroidal-like examples with hydroxyl groups but no carbonyls.

### Final Predicted Property Value: **1.51236692**
==================================================
Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.06045322852464857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate or Phosphorodithioate Groups**: 
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **0.19855939**. This is structurally similar to the target molecule, with the main difference being the replacement of the **SC(CCl)** group with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**.
   - The presence of **P(=S)** seems to contribute positively to the property value (e.g., values around **0.1–0.2**).

2. **Lactam or Aromatic Amide Fragments**:
   - The **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** fragment is a phthalimide-like structure. Similar fragments in other molecules (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., **-0.67449076**), but when combined with other groups (like **P(=S)**), the value becomes less negative or slightly positive.

3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**:
   - Ethoxy groups (**OCC**) are present in many molecules with varying property values, so their influence is likely secondary to the **P(=S)** and lactam fragments.

### Comparison with Most Similar Example:
The closest match is:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** → **0.19855939**

The target molecule replaces **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**. Since the **SC(CCl)** group is somewhat bulky and polar, replacing it with a planar, conjugated lactam (**phthalimide**) might slightly reduce the property value due to increased electron delocalization and reduced steric effects. However, the **P(=S)** and ethoxy groups still dominate.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities, the property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely slightly lower than **0.19855939** but still in the same general range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.11590812**

This aligns with other molecules in the dataset where similar combinations of **P(=S)** and aromatic/lactam fragments yield values in this range (e.g., **0.11590812** for **Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2**). 

### Final Answer:
**0.11590812**

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.387544171179157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCOC, CCCC(C)(C)C, C1CCCCCC1)** tend to have a property value of **3.25460661**.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., C=O, N, Cl, O)** often have negative property values (e.g., -0.67449076 for Cl-substituted aromatics, -0.56498086 for aromatic ketones).
3. **Heterocyclic aromatic systems** (e.g., pyridines, pyrroles, fused rings) with electronegative atoms or polar groups also tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.67449076 for c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32).
4. **Molecules with amide or urea-like structures** (e.g., NC(=O)NC) often have intermediate values (e.g., -0.25186116, 1.25220529).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, which has the following features:
- A **fused heterocyclic system** with two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O).
- An **aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)** attached to one of the nitrogens.
- **Methyl groups (Cc1...n1C)** on the heterocycle.

This structure resembles:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = -0.67449076), which is a fused aromatic heterocycle with nitrogen.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 1.39106238), which has a carbonyl and nitrogen in a ring but is less aromatic.
- **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.67449076), which is a diaryl ketone.

The presence of the **C=O group and fused aromatic nitrogens** suggests a negative property value, likely close to **-0.56498086** (similar to other aromatic ketones or fused N-heterocycles).

### Predicted Property:
**-0.56498086** (similar to other aromatic ketones or fused N-heterocycles in the examples).

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple alkanes and alcohols** (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO`, `CCCCC`, `CC(C)C(C)O`) tend to have a property value of **3.25460661**.
2. **Aromatic or conjugated systems with halogens or heteroatoms** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Oc1ccncc1`) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076** or similar negative values.
3. **Esters and carbonyl-containing compounds** often have intermediate values (e.g., `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has **1.85588282**, `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has **2.45789431**).

The molecule in question is `CCCCCC(=O)OCC`, which is an **ester (ethyl hexanoate)**. It has:
- A linear alkyl chain (`CCCCC`),
- A carbonyl group (`C=O`),
- An ethoxy group (`OCC`).

Given that esters with moderate chain lengths tend to have property values in the **2.0–2.5 range** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is **2.45789431**), and considering the slightly shorter chain here, a reasonable prediction would be slightly lower.

**Predicted property value: 2.45789431** (same as `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, since the chain length difference may not significantly alter the property in this case). 

However, if we consider that `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (a more complex ester) has **1.85588282**, a compromise for `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` might be closer to **2.0**.

But based on the closest structural match (`CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`), I will stick with:

**Final predicted value: 2.45789431**
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.48800349240672475
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to cluster around certain values depending on the structural features of the molecules. 

For the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I notice that it shares similarities with the following molecules from the examples:

1. **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) with a property value of **-0.30925613**.
2. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) with a property value of **-0.30925613**.
3. **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (a benzoate ester with a long chain) with a property value of **0.80009715**, but this is less relevant due to the long alkyl chain.

The molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is structurally very similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, differing only by the alkyl group (methyl vs. ethyl). Since the property value for ethyl benzoate is **-0.30925613**, and the presence of the ester group seems to consistently give values around this range (e.g., **-0.30925613** for both ethyl benzoate and ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), it is reasonable to predict that the property value for methyl benzoate would be very close to this.

Thus, the predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:

**-0.30925613**
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.353052787866625
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes and alkyl chains (e.g., C1CCCC1, CCC(C)(C)CC, CBr) tend to have high positive values (3.25460661).
2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings (e.g., C=Cc1ccccc1, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) tend to have negative values around -0.67449076.
3. The molecule CC/C=C/C (a simple alkene with one double bond) has a positive value of 0.80009715.

The molecule in question, C=CCC=C, is a conjugated diene (two double bonds separated by one single bond). Comparing to similar structures:
- It's more conjugated than CC/C=C/ but less aromatic than fully cyclic conjugated systems.
- The conjugation would likely decrease the property value compared to simple alkenes, but not as much as aromatic systems.

Given that CC/C=C/ has a value of 0.80009715 and aromatic systems have -0.67449076, a reasonable prediction for C=CCC=C would be slightly lower than 0.80009715 but still positive.

Predicted property value: 0.42579477

This matches the value seen for other moderately conjugated systems like ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N and CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O) in the training data.
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value tends to cluster around certain values, particularly **3.25460661** for molecules with certain structural features. 

Key observations:
1. Molecules with **halogen-heavy structures (especially Br, Cl, F)** often have the property value **3.25460661**, especially if they are small and highly halogenated (e.g., `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` and `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).
2. The molecule `BrC(Br)Br` (tribromomethane) is a small, fully brominated compound, structurally similar to other halogen-heavy molecules that have the property value **3.25460661**.
3. Other small halogenated molecules (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) deviate from this trend, but they are larger and more aromatic, which may explain the difference.

Given that `BrC(Br)Br` is a simple, fully brominated alkane (like `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`), the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 3.25460661**
==================================================
Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.19855938856841368
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular features. Here's the analysis:

1. **Highly positive values (~3.25)** are associated with small, non-polar, or saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., `C`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CC(C)N(=O)=O`). These likely represent high hydrophobicity or low polarity.

2. **Moderate positive values (~1.0–2.5)** are seen in molecules with some polarity but still significant hydrocarbon character (e.g., `CCC(C)Cl`, `CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1`).

3. **Negative values (~-0.67)** are common for aromatic systems, especially those with halogens or other electronegative substituents (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, `N#Cc1ccccc1`). These likely represent higher polarity or hydrogen-bonding capacity.

4. **Intermediate values (~-0.5 to 0.5)** occur for molecules with mixed features (e.g., partial polarity, aromatic + aliphatic regions).

### Target Molecule: `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`
- Contains a **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- Has an **aromatic ring** (`c1ccccc1`) and **amide/carbonyl groups** (`C(=O)`), contributing to polarity.
- Includes **aliphatic chains** (`CCO`, `C(CCl)`), which add some hydrophobic character.
- Overall, the molecule is **polar but not as extreme as fully aromatic/halogenated systems**.

### Prediction:
The property value likely falls in the **intermediate range**, similar to other polar-but-not-fully-aromatic molecules in the examples (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **0.29963624**). 

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate and aromatic/amide groups, the predicted value is:  
**~0.30** (closest to the example with similar features).  

### Final Answer:
**0.29963624** (matching the most structurally similar example).

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.11590812147988304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~3.25460661)**:
   - Typically associated with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC`, `ClCCCCl`, `CCCCCCBr`, `CCCCCCCCl`), especially those with halogens (Cl, Br) or hydroxyl groups but no complex aromatic systems.
   - Also seen in very small or symmetric molecules like `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` or `CCC(C)C`.

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~1.0 to ~2.0)**:
   - Seen in molecules with amide or carbonyl groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)C` → 1.51236692, `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` → 1.79829257, `CCC(=O)CC` → 1.79829257).
   - Also in molecules with conjugated systems or multiple functional groups (e.g., `CCCCCC#C` → 1.32404766, `CCCC(C)C1(CC)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O` → 1.39106238).

3. **Low/Negative Property Values (~-0.2 to ~-0.7)**:
   - Dominated by aromatic systems, especially those with halogens, nitro groups, or fused rings (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` → -0.67449076, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` → -0.67449076, `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → -0.67449076).
   - Phenolic or heteroaromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1` → -0.45758419, `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` → -0.5109638).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule has the structure:
```
CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
```
Breaking it down:
1. **Aromatic System**: Contains a chlorinated phenyl ring (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` and a fused heteroaromatic system (`n2nc(oc2=O)`), similar to many low-property examples.
2. **Amide Group**: The `CN(C)C(=O)N` fragment resembles amide-containing molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = 1.79829257), but here it's attached to an aromatic system.
3. **Chlorine Substituent**: The presence of Cl on the aromatic ring is common in low-property molecules (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` → -0.67449076).
4. **Bulky Aliphatic Group**: The `C(C)(C)C` fragment is sterically bulky but not enough to outweigh the aromatic and halogen effects.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are aromatic molecules with halogens and amide/carbonyl groups, which typically have **negative property values** (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` → -0.67449076, `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → -0.67449076).
- The heteroaromatic `n2nc(oc2=O)` fragment is similar to other fused heterocycles (e.g., `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` → -0.67449076).

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the aromatic system, chlorine substituent, and fused heterocycle, the property value is likely **close to -0.67449076**, similar to other aromatic/halogenated examples. The amide group may slightly modulate this, but not enough to push it into positive territory.

**Final Prediction: -0.67449076**

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly polar or halogen-rich aromatic systems** (especially with multiple Cl, Br, or F atoms) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. Examples:
   - `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` → -0.67449076  
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → -0.67449076  
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → -0.67449076  
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.67449076  

2. The given molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
   - Aromatic rings with multiple **Cl substitutions** (3 Cl atoms total).  
   - **Phenol-like structures (O attached to aromatic rings)**, which are also present in other molecules with the -0.67449076 value.  

3. No additional functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, or strongly electron-donating/withdrawing groups beyond Cl and OH) are present to deviate from the trend.  

### Conclusion:
The molecule fits the pattern of **halogenated aromatic systems with polar substituents (OH and Cl)**, which consistently yield **-0.67449076** in the examples.  

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.8000971530170674
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. 

The molecule in question is **CC/C=C\C**, which is a trans-2-butene (or a butene with a trans double bond). 

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (likely cis-2-butene or a similar structure) has a property value of **0.80009715**.
- Simple alkanes or alkenes with small, non-polar structures tend to have positive property values, while more complex or polar/aromatic structures tend to have negative values.

Since **CC/C=C\C** is very similar to **CC/C=C/C** (only differing in the stereochemistry of the double bond), and no other strong functional groups or polarities are introduced, the property value should be very close to that of **CC/C=C/C**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C** is:
**0.80009715** (same as the given trans/cis analogue). 

(Note: If the original **CC/C=C/C** was indeed trans and this is cis, or vice versa, the value might differ slightly, but without explicit examples distinguishing cis/trans effects, this is the most reasonable prediction.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes, alcohols, and ethers (e.g., CC(C)O, CC(C)Cl, C, CCC(O)CC, C1CCCCCC1) consistently have the value **3.25460661**.
2. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple ether (ethoxypropane) with no other functional groups or complex features.
3. Comparing to similar structures:
   - CC(C)O (isopropanol) = 3.25460661
   - CCC(O)CC (2-pentanol) = 3.25460661
   - C1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptane) = 3.25460661

Given this pattern, **CCCOCC** (ethoxypropane) fits the category of simple aliphatic compounds that consistently show the property value **3.25460661**.

### Predicted property value for CCCOCC: **3.25460661**

Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.28262158592115033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Value (~3.25460661)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `C`, `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
   - Alcohols (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O`, `OC1CCCCC1`).
   - Long hydrocarbon chains with polar groups (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCO`).
   - Cyclic alkanes (e.g., `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`).

2. **Intermediate Property Value (~0.8 to ~2.6)**:
   - Molecules with moderate polarity, unsaturation, or functional groups (e.g., `CCC=O`, `CC(C)=CCCC(O)(C)C=C`, `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23`).

3. **Low Property Value (~-0.67449076 or similar)**:
   - Aromatic rings with electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, sulfonamides).
   - Heterocycles with polar groups (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`, `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`).
   - Molecules with multiple halogens or strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Aromatic amides or carbamates (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a value of `-0.48800349`).
   - Bulky aromatic systems (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has `-0.45758419`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**:
- It contains **two aromatic rings** (phenyl groups) and a **tertiary amide** (`N(C=O)N`).
- The structure resembles **bulky aromatic amides** like `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (property = `-0.48800349`) and `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = `-0.45758419`).
- The presence of two phenyl groups and a bulky amide suggests a **low to moderately negative property value**, similar to these examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to molecules with property values around **-0.45 to -0.50**, the predicted property for **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:

**-0.48800349** (matching the closest structural analogue in the examples). 

### Final Answer:
- **Predicted Property Value**: `-0.48800349`
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.48800349240672475
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1), I can predict the property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**: Many molecules with aromatic rings (especially benzene) and substituents like Br, Cl, or NO2 tend to have property values around **-0.67449076**. Examples:
   - `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)` → -0.67449076  
   - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` → -0.67449076  
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` → -0.67449076  
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` → -0.67449076  

2. **Amide or Aniline Derivatives**: When the aromatic ring has an amide (e.g., `CC(=O)N-`) or aniline (`N-`) group, the property tends to shift slightly higher (less negative) than the -0.67449076 baseline. Examples:
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` → -0.45758419  
   - `ClCc1ccccc1` → -0.45758419  
   - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → -0.45758419  

3. **Bromine Substituent**: The presence of Br on the aromatic ring (as in `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) is associated with the -0.67449076 value in many cases, but the amide group (`CC(=O)N-`) may moderate this.

### Prediction:
The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has:
- An aromatic ring with a Br substituent (which would suggest -0.67449076).
- An amide group (`CC(=O)N-`) attached to the ring, which may raise the value slightly (as seen with other aniline/amide derivatives).

Given the competing effects, the property value is likely **between -0.67449076 and -0.45758419**. A reasonable estimate is closer to the amide/aniline examples, but the Br pulls it down slightly. 

**Final predicted property value: -0.48800349**  
(This matches the value observed for `O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2`, which has a similar balance of aromaticity, substituents, and polar groups.) 

Thus, the predicted property for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is:  
**-0.48800349**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.11590812147988304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Benzene derivatives with alkyl substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N**: -0.45758419 (methyl + amino substituent)
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.06045323 (ethyl + methyl substituents)
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: 0.11590812 (isopropyl + methyl substituents)
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1**: -0.67449076 (vinyl substituent)
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1**: -0.67449076 (cyano substituent)
   - **Brc1ccccc1**: -0.67449076 (bromo substituent)

   The property tends to be higher (less negative) when the substituent is a simple alkyl group (e.g., methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) and lower (more negative) when the substituent is polar or unsaturated.

2. **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an **isobutyl** group (branched alkyl) attached to benzene. This is similar to:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl + methyl, property = 0.11590812)
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl + methyl, property = -0.06045323)

   The isobutyl group is larger but still nonpolar, so we expect a value in the same range as these examples, likely slightly higher than **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** due to the longer alkyl chain.

3. **Other alkylbenzenes**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not in the examples, but its derivative **Cc1ccccc1N** has a property of -0.45758419. The alkyl group alone would likely make the property less negative.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl + methyl) = 0.11590812
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl + methyl) = -0.06045323

The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutyl) is expected to have a property slightly higher than **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** because the isobutyl group is larger but similarly nonpolar. 

A reasonable estimate is:
**Predicted property = 0.11590812** (same as isopropyl + methyl case, since the additional methylene group in isobutyl may not significantly change the property).

### Final Answer:
**0.11590812**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) can be predicted by comparing its structural features to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic ring with a carbonyl group**: 
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide with a hydroxyl group) has a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) also has a value of **-0.67449076**.
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) similarly has **-0.67449076**.

2. **Benzene derivatives with polar substituents** (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, hydroxyl) tend to cluster around **-0.67449076**, unless other bulky/aliphatic features dominate (e.g., alkyl chains or steric effects).

3. **Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1)** is structurally similar to these examples, featuring a benzene ring with a polar carbonyl (aldehyde) group. No additional bulky or strongly electron-donating/withdrawing groups are present to significantly deviate from the trend.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the consistency of the property value for benzene derivatives with polar substituents, the predicted property for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is:

  - A **nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)** attached to an aromatic ring (strong electron-withdrawing effect).
  - A **fused heterocyclic system** with two amide-like (`C(=O)N`) groups.
  - An **aromatic ring** with an oxygen substituent (`o1`).

### Comparison to Examples:
1. The presence of the nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) on an aromatic ring is strongly associated with the value `-0.67449076` (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`).
2. The heterocyclic core (`O=C2CN...C(=O)N2`) is similar to molecules like `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (value `-0.67449076`), which also have aromatic heterocycles with electron-withdrawing effects.

### Conclusion:
The structural features (nitro group + aromatic heterocycle) most closely match molecules with the property value **`-0.67449076`**.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, I can make the following observations:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The molecule is a diphenylamine derivative (two phenyl rings connected via a nitrogen atom). Similar structures in the dataset include:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) with a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene derivative) with a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43** (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) with **-0.67449076**.

2. **Key Trends**:
   - Molecules with extended conjugated systems (e.g., aromatic rings, polyaromatics) tend to have the value **-0.67449076** unless other functional groups significantly alter the property.
   - The presence of nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or other polar substituents slightly increases the value (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has **-0.45758419**).
   - The diphenylamine structure is electronically similar to the examples above, lacking strongly perturbing substituents.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally analogous to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (same conjugated system, just replacing =N– with –NH–), and both are diphenyl derivatives like many others in the dataset with **-0.67449076**.
   - No additional functional groups are present to deviate from this trend.

Thus, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**-0.67449076**.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.9052497606923283
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring (similar to succinimide derivatives but with an additional cyclohexane ring).

2. **Similarity to Examples**:
   - The molecule **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 1.51236692) is a cyclic diamide (hydantoin derivative) with a 5-membered ring and substituents. The property is positive and moderately high (~1.51).
   - The molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 1.39106238) is another cyclic diamide with a larger ring system and alkyl substituents, also yielding a positive property (~1.39).
   - The molecule **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 1.51236692) is a simple cyclic amide (lactam), also with a positive property (~1.51).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Cyclic amides/diamides (e.g., lactams, imides, hydantoins) tend to have positive property values in the range of ~1.3 to ~1.5.
   - The presence of the cyclohexane ring in the target molecule may slightly reduce the property compared to simpler cyclic diamides (due to increased hydrophobicity), but the strong polarity of the imide groups dominates.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is most similar to cyclic diamides like **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 1.39106238) and **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 1.51236692). Given its balanced structure (no extreme hydrophobicity or polarity), the property should lie in the middle of this range.

**Predicted property value: 1.45** (approximate, likely between 1.39 and 1.51). 

For specificity, we can interpolate toward the simpler cyclic diamide examples and predict:
**Predicted property = 1.45**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that cyclic amides/diamides with moderate size and polarity yield values in this range.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Highly negative values (~ -0.674)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (e.g., Cl, F, I, Br).
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or conjugated systems.
   - Examples: `Clc1ccccc1Cl`, `Fc1cccc(F)c1...`, `N#Cc1ccccc1`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`.

2. **Moderately negative values (~ -0.457 to -0.353)** are seen for:
   - Aromatic systems with fewer halogens or additional functional groups (e.g., `CN(C)c1nc(nc(n1)N(C)C)N(C)C`).
   - Some heterocyclic or fused-ring systems.

3. **The given molecule: `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`**:
   - Contains **three aromatic rings** (two benzene rings and a biphenyl-like structure).
   - Has **three chlorine substitutions** (strong electron-withdrawing groups).
   - Structurally similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (property = -0.457) but with even more aromaticity and halogens.

Given the **high aromaticity and multiple chlorine substitutions**, this molecule fits the pattern for the **most negative property values** in the dataset (around **-0.674**). 

### Predicted property value: **-0.67449076**  

This matches the trend for heavily halogenated polyaromatic systems in the examples.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.11590812147988304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = **0.42579477**
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine): Property = **-0.45758419**
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): Property = **-0.67449076**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property = **-0.67449076**
   - **C=CC=O** (acrolein): Property = **-0.67449076**

   Simple aromatic hydrocarbons or substituted benzenes with small alkyl groups tend to have property values around **0.42579477** (if non-polar) or negative values (if polar or with electronegative substituents like NO₂, Cl, or C=O).

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a non-polar aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups (similar to hexylbenzene but with shorter alkyl chains).
   - No electronegative substituents are present, so the property value should be positive and likely similar to hexylbenzene but potentially slightly lower due to shorter alkyl chains.

3. **Alkyl Chain Influence**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., hexylbenzene: 0.42579477) seem to have higher values than shorter ones.
   - Diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups, which are shorter than a hexyl group but still contribute to hydrophobicity/non-polarity.

4. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (a cyclic ketone with unsaturated alkyl): Property = **0.42579477**
   - **CCCC(=O)CC** (a ketone with alkyl chains): Property = **2.00447284**
   - The presence of C=O reduces the value unless balanced by long alkyl chains.

   Since diethylbenzene has no polar groups, its value should be closer to hexylbenzene.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to hexylbenzene but with slightly shorter alkyl chains, the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is likely slightly lower than **0.42579477**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.35** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

However, since the examples show simple alkylbenzenes like hexylbenzene at **0.42579477**, and no smaller alkylbenzenes are provided, I will conservatively predict the same value as hexylbenzene:

**Final Prediction: 0.42579477** (same as hexylbenzene, as diethylbenzene is similarly non-polar with moderate alkyl substitution). 

If the trend suggests smaller alkyl groups reduce the value slightly, an alternative could be **0.40**, but the given examples do not provide enough granularity for a more precise adjustment. 

Given the data, **0.42579477** is the most consistent prediction.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO₂)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O`) often have property values around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`, `ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl)Cl`, `Oc1ccncc1`). 
   - However, some nitro-containing molecules deviate (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has **-0.45758419**).

2. **Sulfonamide Group (S(N)(=O)=O)**:
   - The sulfonamide group is structurally similar to nitro groups (both are strong electron-withdrawing groups). 
   - No exact matches in the examples, but sulfonamides are likely to behave similarly to nitro groups in terms of contributing to the property value.

3. **Aromatic Amines (Nc1ccc...)**: 
   - Aromatic amines (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have a value of **-0.67449076**. 
   - The presence of an aromatic amine with an electron-withdrawing group (like nitro or sulfonamide) tends to push the property toward **-0.67449076**.

4. **Other Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) or bulky groups can increase the value (e.g., `ClCBr` has **3.25460661**), but this molecule lacks such features.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** has:
- An aromatic amine (`Nc1ccc...`).
- A sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`), which is electron-withdrawing like a nitro group.

Given the similarity to `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (which has **-0.67449076**), the sulfonamide is expected to have a comparable effect. Thus, the predicted property value is:

**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features:

1. Highly chlorinated or brominated aromatic systems (like hexachlorobenzene derivatives) consistently show a value of -0.67449076
2. Simple aliphatic chains and cycloalkanes (like C1CCCC1, C1CCCCCC1, CCCOCC) consistently show 3.25460661
3. Aromatic systems with some substitution tend to show values around -0.45 to -0.6
4. More complex polycyclic systems show intermediate values

The molecule in question is: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34

This is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (specifically, phenanthrene). Looking at similar structures in the examples:

- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 shows -0.60129631
- Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 shows -0.5805175
- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 shows -0.67449076

Phenanthrene is somewhat similar to these, being a 3-ring aromatic system. The fully conjugated system with no heteroatoms or substituents suggests a value similar to these other polycyclic aromatics.

The closest analog is probably c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (value -0.67449076), which is also a fully conjugated polycyclic system.

Therefore, I predict the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 to be: -0.67449076

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.4739354317843205
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I observe the following patterns:

1. Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to have high property values around 3.25460661.
2. Simple aliphatic alcohols and ethers also tend to have this high value (e.g., CCCC(C)O, OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O).
3. Aromatic systems with oxygen substituents (phenols, catechols) typically have values around -0.67449076.
4. More complex polycyclic or conjugated systems with oxygen functionalities often have intermediate values between -0.6 and -0.4.

The target molecule: 
Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3

This is a complex polycyclic system with multiple phenolic -OH groups and a carbonyl group. Based on the examples:
- Similar oxygen-rich aromatic systems like Oc1cccc(O)c1 have -0.67449076
- More complex but still oxygen-rich systems like OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl have -0.59219704
- The presence of multiple phenolic -OH groups and a carbonyl suggests a value in the -0.6 to -0.4 range

Considering the structural complexity is higher than simple phenols but maintains similar oxygen functionality, I predict an intermediate value between the simple phenol case and more complex oxygenated aromatics.

Predicted property value: -0.59219704

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 1.512366924026521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCC(C)O, CCCI)**: These tend to have a property value of **3.25460661**, suggesting that small, non-polar, aliphatic chains have this high value.
2. **Polar or Functionalized Molecules**:
   - Molecules with **ester groups (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC)** have values around **2.37830491** or **2.15989687**.
   - Molecules with **nitro groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O)** have values around **-0.45758419**.
   - Molecules with **phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate groups (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)** have values around **-0.25186116** or **-0.35305279**.
   - Molecules with **amide or urea-like groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2)** have values around **-0.48800349**.
3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems (e.g., Cc1cccc(C)c1) have values around **-0.25186116**.
   - Aromatics with polar substituents (e.g., Cc1cccc(O)cc1) have values around **-0.45758419**.
4. **Halogenated Aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: These tend to have values around **-0.67449076**.
5. **Complex or Mixed Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl) have values that seem to average or combine the effects of the individual groups (here, **1.25220529**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
This molecule has:
1. A **phosphoramidate-thioate** group (**P(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**), which is somewhat similar to phosphorothioates in the examples (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl with value **-0.25186116**).
2. An **amide group (NC(C)=O)**, which is polar and might lower the value (similar to other amides in the examples with values around **-0.48800349**).
3. A **thioether (SC)** group, which is less polar than an oxygen ether but still polar.

Given the combination of these features, the property value is likely to be in the range of **phosphorothioates with additional polar groups**, but not as low as highly polar or nitro-substituted aromatics. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.25186116** (simple phosphorothioate) and **-0.48800349** (amide-like). Given the additional polarity from the amide and thioether, the value might lean closer to the amide-like examples. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.35305279**  

This aligns with similar phosphorothioate-amide hybrid structures in the examples.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features:

1. **High values (~3.25460661)**: These are associated with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CC1CCCC1`, `CCCC(C)C`, `CCBr`) or aliphatic alcohols/ethers (e.g., `CCCCCCCCO`, `CCCCO`). These molecules lack significant functional groups or conjugation.

2. **Intermediate values (~0.5–2.0)**: These often contain carbonyl groups (e.g., `CCCC(=O)C` at 1.79829257), amides, or moderately complex aliphatic structures with some polarity.

3. **Low/negative values (~-0.67449076)**: These are associated with highly conjugated systems (e.g., `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`), aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., `Nc1cccc2ccccc12`), or halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`). These molecules often have extended π-systems or strong electron-withdrawing effects.

### Molecule to Predict: `Cl\C=C/Cl` (1,2-dichloroethene)
- This is a small, planar molecule with a double bond and two chlorine atoms. The Cl substituents introduce polarity, and the C=C bond provides limited conjugation (but no aromaticity or extended π-system).
- It lacks the complexity or strong conjugation/aromaticity seen in the low-value examples.
- It is more similar to simple halogenated aliphatic compounds (e.g., `CCBr` has a high value of 3.25460661), but the C=C bond and planarity might reduce the property slightly compared to pure aliphatics.

### Predicted Property:
Given the lack of aromaticity or extended conjugation, but with some polarity from the Cl atoms, the value is likely **intermediate**. Comparing to similar-sized polar/aliphatic molecules in the examples (e.g., `CCC=O` at 1.09192229), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: ~1.1** (likely between 1.0 and 1.3). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would differ.)

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple aliphatic chains with halogens or hydroxyl groups** (e.g., CCCCCCCBr, CCC(C)(C)CO, ClC(Cl)Cl) consistently have a property value of **3.25460661**.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar or electronegative substituents** (e.g., Oc1cccc(Cl)c1, CNc1ccccc1, COc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) tend to have **negative values** (ranging from -0.06 to -0.67).
   - The presence of **nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**, **chlorine**, or **oxygen** in aromatic rings correlates with more negative values.
3. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons without polar groups** (e.g., Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1, CCc1ccc2ccccc2c1) have values around **-0.4 to -0.5**.
4. **Heteroaromatic systems** (e.g., COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, Cc1ncnc2nccnc12) also fall in the **-0.45 to -0.46** range.

### Analysis of **c1ccncc1** (pyridine):
- Pyridine is a **simple heteroaromatic ring** with a nitrogen atom. It lacks polar substituents (like nitro or hydroxyl groups) but has a nitrogen heteroatom contributing to its polarity.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): **-0.45758419**
  - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (heteroaromatic with N and O): **-0.45758419**
  - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (heteroaromatic with N): **-0.45758419**

Given that pyridine is a **bare heteroaromatic system** (no additional substituents), its property value should align closely with other simple nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics in the dataset. The recurring value for such systems is **-0.45758419**.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~3.25460661)**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCC**, **CCCCCC(C)O**, **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**).
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., **ClCCCl**, **BrC(Br)Br**).
   - Small polar molecules (e.g., **CSC**, **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**).

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~0.01696451 to ~2.28113825)**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)CC** ~2.281, **CCCCC(=O)OC** ~2.004).
   - Amides (e.g., **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2** ~0.016).
   - Nitriles (e.g., **ClCC#N** ~0.425).

3. **Low/Negative Property Values (~-0.67449076 to ~-0.25186116)**:
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2cnccc2c1**, **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** ~-0.674).
   - Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** ~-0.674).
   - Complex fused rings (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34** ~-0.674).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** has:
1. **Polar Aliphatic Region**: **OCC(O)CO** (similar to high-property molecules like **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**).
2. **Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene ring, often lowers property value).
   - **Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** (chlorinated fused heteroaromatic system, similar to low-property examples like **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**).
3. **Ester Linkage**: **OC(=O)** (intermediate property contribution, e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** ~-0.060).

### Prediction:
The molecule combines:
- A high-property polar aliphatic region (~3.254).
- A low-property aromatic/heteroaromatic region (~-0.674).
- An ester linkage (~0 to 2.281, but likely closer to 0 due to aromatic conjugation).

The net effect is likely **closer to the lower end** due to the dominant influence of the aromatic/heteroaromatic systems and the ester's conjugation with the benzene ring. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted Property Value: ~-0.38754417**  
*(This aligns with similar molecules like **CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C** and **c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2**, which have mixed polar/aliphatic and aromatic features.)*

   Simple alcohols and hydrocarbons with no polar or electronegative groups (other than -OH or halogens) tend to have higher property values (often 3.25460661). 

2. **Polar or Functionalized Molecules:**
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, amide, halogen substitutions) tend to have lower property values, often negative or near zero.
   - For example:
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1**: -0.67449076
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Oc1cc(C)nn1c2ccccc2**: -0.29191574
     - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.42579477

3. **Linear Alcohols:**
   - The only linear alcohol in the examples is **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol), which has a value of 3.25460661. 
   - **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol (1-pentanol), structurally similar to cycloheptanol but acyclic. 

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol with no additional polar or electronegative groups. 
- It is most similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) and other simple alcohols/hydrocarbons with high property values (3.25460661).
- There is no reason to expect significant deviation from this trend, as the property seems to favor simple, non-polar/alcohol structures.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is **3.25460661**.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.25186115933029796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`), which is common in many of the examples. Aromatic rings often correlate with negative or low property values (e.g., `-0.67449076` in many cases).
2. **Sulfonyl Group (`S(=O)(=O)`)** and **Ether/Oxygen Heterocycle (`CCO1`)**: These polar functional groups introduce some polarity but are not strongly indicative of high property values in the examples.
3. **Amide Linkage (`C(=O)Nc2ccccc2`)**: Amides are polar but do not consistently correlate with high property values in the examples.
4. **Heterocyclic Core (`CC1=C...CCO1`)**: The fused ring system with sulfur and oxygen is somewhat complex, but similar fused systems in the examples (e.g., `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2`) tend to have negative or low property values.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2`, `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`) consistently have the property value `-0.67449076`.
- The sulfonyl group appears in other molecules (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`), but these do not deviate significantly from the low/negative trend unless paired with very large aliphatic chains or highly nonpolar regions.
- The presence of the amide and sulfonyl groups does not seem to elevate the property value significantly in the examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of aromaticity and polar groups in the molecule, and the consistent trend in the examples, the most likely property value is **-0.67449076**. This value appears repeatedly for aromatic systems with moderate polarity, and no strong aliphatic or nonpolar regions are present to elevate it.

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.15428387743872032
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`  

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic System**: The molecule contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) substituted with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is electron-withdrawing. Similar nitro-substituted aromatics in the examples (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have property values around **-0.45758419**.
2. **Ester Groups**: Two ester groups (`C(=O)OC`) are present, which are polar and moderately electron-withdrawing. Esters in the examples (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC`) are associated with values around **2.00447284**, but this is likely due to their aliphatic nature. Here, the esters are conjugated with an aromatic system, which may reduce the value.
3. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule has a partially unsaturated heterocycle (`C1=C(C)NC(=C...)`) with nitrogen, which can contribute to polarity and conjugation. Similar nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., `Cc1ccncc1C`) have values around **-0.17350217**.
4. **Substituents**: The nitro group and esters are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which typically lower the property value (as seen in other nitro/ester-containing examples).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = **-0.45758419**), which shares the nitro-substituted benzene motif.
- The additional ester groups and heterocycle may further lower the value slightly due to increased conjugation and polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of the nitro group, esters, and heterocycle, the property value is likely slightly more negative than **-0.45758419**. A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.47 to -0.50**. 

From the examples, `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (a complex nitro/heterocycle/ester system) has a value of **-0.47393543**, which is a good match.

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.4257947679919579
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCO`, `CC(Cl)CCl`, `C1CCCCC1`)**: These tend to have high positive values (e.g., `3.25460661`), especially if they contain no polar or aromatic groups.
2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., `Clc1cccc(I)c1`, `c1ccncc1`, `Brc1cccc2ccccc12`)**: These often have negative values around `-0.67449076`, especially if they are unsubstituted or halogen-substituted.
3. **Polar or Functionalized Aromatics (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`)**: These can have slightly less negative values (e.g., `-0.30925613` or `-0.67449076`), depending on the functional groups.
4. **Molecules with Amides/Carbamates (e.g., `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`)**: These tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., `-0.43834827`).
5. **Cyclic Structures with Multiple Polar Groups (e.g., `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`)**: These can have positive but lower values (e.g., `1.9091441`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2` is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a cyclopropane ring fused to it. Key features:
- Two amide (`C=O`) groups in a cyclic arrangement (imide).
- A small strained ring (`CC1`), which may slightly increase the property value compared to pure aromatics.
- No aromaticity, but polar amide groups dominate.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- The closest examples are cyclic amides or imides, such as `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (property `-0.43834827`) and `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (property `-0.5805175`). These are more complex but share the imide-like polar groups.
- The absence of aromaticity in the target molecule suggests it might be less negative than pure aromatics but still negative due to the polar amides.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of polar amide groups and the lack of aromaticity, the property is likely moderately negative, similar to other cyclic amides/imide structures. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: `-0.45`** (approximately between `-0.43834827` and `-0.5805175`). 

For specificity, we can round to **`-0.45758419`**, which aligns with other polar cyclic structures in the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCC, CCC(C)(C)CC) tend to have high positive values around 3.254
2. Aromatic compounds with halogens (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl) tend to have values around -0.674
3. Small halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClCC) aren't directly represented, but we can interpolate:
   - CC#N (small polar molecule) has 0.425
   - C1CC=CC1 (small cyclic) has 0.800
   - Clc1ccccc1 (aromatic with Cl) has -0.674
   - Simple alkanes have ~3.254

ClCC is a small, chlorinated alkane with:
- Some polarity from the Cl, but not as much as in aromatic systems
- Less hydrophobic character than pure alkanes
- No aromatic stabilization or complex functional groups

Given these observations and comparing to similar-sized molecules in the dataset, the most reasonable prediction would be between the small polar molecule (CC#N at 0.425) and the small cyclic (C1CC=CC1 at 0.800), but slightly lower due to the electronegative chlorine.

Predicted property value for ClCC: **0.600** (estimated midpoint between similar small molecules, adjusted for halogen effects)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.4153959470634692
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Value (3.25460661):**
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., `ClCC(Cl)Cl`, `BrC(Cl)Cl`).
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`).
   - No aromatic rings or conjugated systems.

2. **Low Property Value (-0.67449076):**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23`, `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`).
   - Nitro groups attached to aromatic rings (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl`).

3. **Intermediate Values (e.g., ~0.1 to 2.0):**
   - Molecules with mixed features (e.g., aliphatic and aromatic parts, polar groups like carbonyls or amides).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**
- The molecule consists of:
  - A chlorinated aromatic ring (`Clc1cccc(n1)`).
  - A `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` group (trichloromethyl) attached to the aromatic ring.
- From the examples, halogenated aromatic rings (especially with nitro groups) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. However, this molecule does not have a nitro group but has a highly chlorinated methyl group.
- The trichloromethyl group (`C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) is similar to `CCl3` in some examples (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O` with value **0.80009715**), but the aromatic ring likely dominates the property.

### Prediction:
Given the strong trend that aromatic rings with halogens (especially without nitro groups) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**, and the trichloromethyl group does not seem to significantly shift this value in the examples, the most likely prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.67449076**

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 3.2546066103742386

   - CCCC1CCCC1 → 3.25460661
   - CCCC(O)CCC → 3.25460661
   - CCC(C)CCO → 3.25460661

   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl → 3.25460661
   - CCC(CC)CO → 3.25460661

2. The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched aliphatic alcohol (specifically, 2-hexanol), structurally similar to the alcohols above (e.g., CCCC(O)CCC, CCC(C)CCO). 

3. No other conflicting functional groups or structural features (e.g., aromatics, double bonds, carbonyls, halogens other than Cl/Br/F) are present to lower the value.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Molecules (e.g., long carbon chains or fully saturated structures)**:
   - Examples: `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO`, `ClCCl`, `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `CI`, `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`.
   - Property value: **3.25460661** (consistently high for these types of molecules).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogen Substituents (Cl/Br)**:
   - Examples: 
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`: **-0.67449076**
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`: **-0.67449076**
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`: **-0.67449076**
     - `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1`: **-0.67449076**
   - These molecules share a common feature: **aromatic rings with multiple halogen (Cl/Br) substituents**, and their property values are consistently **-0.67449076**.

3. **Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` (polycyclic aromatic): **-0.67449076**
   - `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3` (extended conjugation): **-0.67449076**
   - `c1ccccc1SC` (aromatic + sulfur): **-0.45758419**
   - `Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12` (methyl-substituted aromatic): **-0.41539595**

4. **Molecules with Mixed Features**:
   - Some molecules with polar groups (e.g., `CCOC(=O)N`, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1cc(C)nc(n1)C(C)C`) have intermediate values (e.g., **1.09192229** or **0.16357859**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**
- This is a **benzene ring with two bromine substituents** (para-substituted dibromobenzene).
- Structurally, it is very similar to the examples with **two chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring**, which all have the property value **-0.67449076**.
- Bromine and chlorine are both halogens with similar electronegativity and hydrophobic properties, so the substitution of Br for Cl is unlikely to significantly change the property in this context.

### Predicted Property:
Given the consistency of the property value for aromatic rings with multiple halogen substituents, the predicted property for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is:

**-0.67449076**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value often correlates with the degree of halogenation (particularly chlorine substitution) and the overall symmetry or complexity of the molecule. 

Key observations:
1. Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds (like hexachlorobenzene derivatives) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - Example: `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **-0.67449076**
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` (nitro-substituted polycyclic) → **-0.67449076**

2. The given molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with 6 chlorines, structurally similar to the first example (which also has 6 chlorines but in a more symmetric arrangement).

3. Other polychlorinated or highly symmetric aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45`) also default to **-0.67449076**.

Given this pattern, the predicted property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring). 
   - Aromatic rings with simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., `CC1CC2C3CCC(O)(C(=O)C)C3(C)CC(O)C2(F)C4(C)C=CC(=O)C=C14` with property 1.391) or polar substitutions (e.g., `CC1CC(C)C(=O)C(C1)C(O)CC2CC(=O)NC(=O)C2` with property 1.798) tend to have positive property values.
   - Aromatic rings with halogens or highly polar groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` with property -0.674) tend to have negative property values.

2. **Phosphate Group (P=O)**: The presence of a phosphate group (`OP(=O)(...)`) is a polar and bulky feature. 
   - Similar polar groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with property 0.198) suggest a moderate positive or near-zero property value.

3. **Alkyl Substitutions**: The molecule has methyl (`C`) substitutions on the aromatic rings, which are non-polar and small. 
   - Simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1` with property -0.060) often lead to small negative or near-zero values.

4. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is large and has both polar (phosphate) and non-polar (alkyl, aromatic) regions. 
   - Large molecules with mixed polarity (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` with property 2.816) tend to have higher positive values, but the phosphate group may reduce this.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest structural analogs are molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups, such as:
  - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property 0.198)
  - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` (property 0.115)
  - `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (property 0.115)

These suggest a property value in the range of **0.1 to 0.2**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the phosphate group's polarity and the aromatic/alkyl balance, the predicted property value is **0.19855939** (matching the closest analog with a phosphate-like group). 

### Final Answer:

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.16357859053441767
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in **FC(F)(F)**, which is highly electronegative and often associated with moderate polarity or electron-withdrawing effects. In the examples, molecules with CF3 or similar halogens (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(...)**) tend to have property values around **-0.457** to **-0.251**.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The **c1cccc(c1)** moiety is substituted with CF3 and a heterocyclic group. Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl) often have negative property values (e.g., **-0.457** to **-0.674**).
3. **Heterocyclic ketone (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar group with two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Similar polar/heterocyclic groups (e.g., **NS(=O)(=O)...**) in the examples have values around **-0.457**.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: Multiple Cl substituents, value = **-0.457**.
- **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl**: Polar sulfonamide/heterocycle, value = **-0.457**.
- **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O**: Nitro and hydroxyl groups, value = **-0.457**.

The presence of **CF3**, **Cl**, and a polar heterocycle suggests a similar property value to these examples.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarities, the most plausible prediction is:  
**-0.45758419** (matching the trend for polar, halogenated, and heterocyclic systems).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.45758419**

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.45758418999739003
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, `c1ccccc1O`, `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2`) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and appears to dominate the property value when present on an aromatic system.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - The methoxy group (`OCH3`) is present in some molecules, but its effect seems secondary to the nitro group when both are present. For example, `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has a value of -0.35305279, but this also includes ester groups, which complicate the comparison.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with nitro groups (e.g., `c1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) have the value -0.67449076, as noted above.
   - The methoxy substitution (`COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) is unlikely to significantly shift the property away from the nitro-dominated trend, as electron-donating groups (like methoxy) don't override the strong electron-withdrawing effect of nitro in these examples.

### Conclusion:
The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is an aromatic ring with a methoxy group and a nitro group. Given that nitro-substituted aromatics consistently show a property value of **-0.67449076** in the examples, and no other conflicting functional groups are present, the predicted property value is:

**-0.67449076**

True Property: 1.7982925708997806
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, I can make the following observations:

1. The property values seem to cluster around certain key numbers, particularly 3.25460661 and -0.67449076 appearing frequently.

2. Molecules with multiple halogen atoms (especially chlorine) in aliphatic/cyclic structures tend to have the property value 3.25460661 (e.g., ClCCCl, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, BrC(Br)Br).

3. The molecule in question (ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl) is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound, similar to the pattern observed in other highly halogenated aliphatic/cyclic compounds that have the value 3.25460661.

4. The presence of 8 chlorine atoms in a polycyclic structure strongly suggests this will follow the same pattern as other highly halogenated aliphatic compounds in the dataset.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is:

   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): 3.25460661
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 0.42579477
   - **CCCC#C** (1-pentyne): 1.09192229
   - **CCCCC#C** (1-hexyne): 1.51236692
   - **CCCCCCC#C** (1-heptyne): 1.51236692
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1-nonene): 1.79829257
   - Simple hydrocarbons with no heteroatoms or functional groups tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 3.25460661 for cycloheptane, C1CCCCCC1).

2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (complex polyether): 0.61057071
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenethyl alcohol): -0.25186116
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): -0.30925613
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C(C)C** (barbiturate derivative): 0.58720052
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol): 3.25460661
   - Oxygen-containing groups (ethers, esters, alcohols) can lead to a wide range of values, but simple alcohols or polyols (e.g., sorbitol) can have high positive values (3.25460661), while esters or aromatic alcohols tend to have negative or near-zero values.

3. **Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.30925613
   - **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate) is a simple aliphatic ester, similar to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate but without the aromatic ring or amine group. Simple esters tend to have slightly negative values.

4. **Halogenated compounds**:
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane): 3.25460661
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): -0.67449076
   - Halogenation can lead to high positive values if the molecule is highly halogenated (e.g., hexachlorocyclohexane), but simple aromatic halogenation tends to give negative values.

5. **Nitrogen-containing compounds**:
   - **NNc1ccccc1** (hydrazinobenzene): -0.67449076
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(C)c(Cl)c1**: -0.14064844
   - Nitrogen tends to reduce the property value, often leading to negative or near-zero values.

6. **Sulfur-containing compounds**:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 0.11590812
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSP(=S)(OCC)OCC**: 3.25460661
   - Sulfur can lead to high positive values, especially in phosphorothioates or thiocarbonates.

### Prediction for CCCOC=O (propyl formate):
- This is a simple aliphatic ester (formate ester with a propyl group). 
- From the examples, simple esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) have a value of -0.30925613. 
- Propyl formate is even simpler (no aromatic ring or amine), so it might have a slightly less negative value but still in the same range. 
- Another similar example is **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** with -0.28262159, which is also an ester.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely in the range of **-0.25 to -0.35**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.30** (similar to other simple esters in the dataset).

### Final Answer:
**-0.30** (approximate, based on similar ester examples).

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 2.5804541203722318
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = 0.42579477) tend to have positive property values. 
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 2.15989687) has a large hydrophobic structure.
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** has a long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**C(=O)OCC**), which is somewhat polar but dominated by the long hydrophobic tail.

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or charged groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**, property = -0.67449076) tend to have negative property values.
   - Esters (like **C(=O)OCC**) are moderately polar but not as strongly negative as phenols or nitro groups.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (property = 0.42579477) is a long alkyl chain attached to a benzene ring.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (not in the examples, but similar to the ester part of the target molecule) would likely have a lower value than the long-chain version.
   - The long alkyl chain (**CCCCCCCC**) will dominate the property, pushing it toward positive values.

4. **Highest Values**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CC**, **CCI**, **CC(C)I**) have the highest property values (3.25460661), suggesting that hydrophobicity maximizes the property.
   - The presence of the ester group in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** will reduce the property compared to a pure alkane but not as much as highly polar groups.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- The long alkyl chain (**CCCCCCCC**) suggests a high positive contribution, similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (0.42579477) but even higher due to the longer chain.
- The ester group (**C(=O)OCC**) is polar but not as detrimental as groups like nitro or multiple halogens.
- The molecule is most similar to **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** (property = 2.15989687) in terms of balancing a long hydrophobic region with a polar group.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.28113825**  
*(This aligns with the trend of long-chain molecules with moderate polar groups, similar to **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** but slightly higher due to the longer alkyl chain.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two benzene rings, which are common in many of the examples. Aromatic rings alone often correlate with a property value around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)c3ccccc13`).
2. **Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present in multiple positions. From examples like `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (-0.45758419) and `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-0.67449076), Cl does not significantly increase the property value.
   - **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: Seen in `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-0.67449076), suggesting it does not increase the value.
   - **Hydroxy Group (OH)**: Present in `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (-0.67449076), which does not increase the value.
   - **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Seen in `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (-0.47393543), which is slightly higher than pure aromatics but still negative.
3. **Polar Functional Groups**: The combination of OH, Cl, NO2, and amide suggests moderate polarity, but not enough to push the value into the positive range (unlike large aliphatic chains or phosphorus/sulfur groups, which correlate with higher values like 3.25460661).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (-0.47393543), which has an amide and aromatic rings with Cl and ether. Our molecule replaces the ether with a nitro group and adds another Cl, but these are not strongly elevating features.
- Another similar molecule is `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-0.67449076), which has a nitro group and Cl on an aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of aromatic rings with moderately polar substituents (Cl, NO2, OH, amide) and the absence of large aliphatic or strongly elevating groups (e.g., P, S, long chains), the property value is likely in the **negative range**, similar to other aromatic systems with polar substituents. 

The value is expected to be slightly higher than `-0.67449076` (pure aromatics) but lower than `-0.45758419` (simple Cl-substituted aromatics). A reasonable estimate is around **-0.50**, based on the amide's slight elevation effect.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.50** (approximate, likely between -0.47 and -0.55).

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.25186115933029796
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, several patterns emerge regarding the relationship between molecular structures and their associated property values:

1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. This suggests that heavily chlorinated benzene rings or similar structures correlate strongly with this value.

2. **Simple aliphatic chains** (e.g., CCCCCCCC, CCCCCCCCO, CCCO) and **halogenated alkanes** (e.g., CBr, ClCCCCl) tend to have a property value of **3.25460661**, especially when they lack polar or aromatic groups.

3. **Compounds with sulfur or phosphorus** in certain contexts (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C) often have values around **0.29963624** or **-0.29191574**, depending on the rest of the structure.

4. **Aromatic systems with moderate substitution** (e.g., CCc1ccccc1CC, Cc1ccc(C)cc1) tend to have values around **0.11590812**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

Key features:
- Contains **two phosphate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)** linked to aromatic rings.
- Has a **thioether linkage (S)** between two benzene rings.
- The structure is symmetric, with two identical halves connected by sulfur.

Given the presence of:
- **P=S and P-O bonds** (similar to COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a value of **0.29963624**),
- **Aromatic systems** (though not heavily chlorinated, which would push the value toward -0.67449076),
- **Sulfur linkage** (which doesn't drastically alter the value in other examples),

The closest analog is the phosphate-containing molecule with a value of **0.29963624**. The symmetry and additional aromaticity might slightly reduce the value, but not enough to match the chlorinated aromatic trend.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.29963624** (same as the closest matching example). 

This is based on the dominance of the phosphate groups in determining the property, as seen in other similar structures. The aromatic and sulfur components do not appear to significantly deviate from this trend in the given examples.

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

1. **Aromatic rings with nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** tend to have property values around **-0.457 to -0.674**, e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.45758419) and `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` (-0.67449076).  
2. **Phenol derivatives (aromatic rings with -OH)** often have values around **-0.251 to -0.674**, e.g., `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (-0.67449076) and `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` (-0.25186116).  
3. **Combined nitro and hydroxyl substituents** (like in the query molecule) are not explicitly present in the examples, but similar structures suggest a value closer to the **lower end** of the range (around **-0.674**).  

The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is a **nitrophenol**, which combines both a hydroxyl (-OH) and a nitro (-NO₂) group on an aromatic ring. Given the examples, this structural motif aligns most closely with molecules like `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` and `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`, which have property values of **-0.67449076**.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.67449076**  

This prediction is based on the consistent trend that heavily substituted aromatic systems (especially with electronegative groups like -NO₂, -Cl, or -OH) converge to this value in the provided dataset.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain values for specific structural features. Here are some key observations:

1. **Highly branched or complex cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., sugars, steroids)** often have property values around **1.0 to 3.25**. For example:
   - `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` has a value of **2.81657324**.
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple sugar) has a value of **3.25460661**.

2. **Small or linear hydrocarbons** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes) tend to have higher values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` has **3.25460661**).

3. **Aromatic or conjugated systems with halogens or heteroatoms** tend to have negative values (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has **-0.67449076**).

The molecule in question is:
```
OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
```
This is a **complex sugar (oligosaccharide)** with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages. Based on the examples:
- Sugars like `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` have a value of **3.25460661**.
- Larger or more branched sugars (like this one) may retain similarly high values due to their polar, highly functionalized nature.

Thus, the predicted property value for this molecule is likely:
**3.25460661** (same as other sugar-like structures in the dataset). 

This is consistent with the trend that highly oxygenated, flexible, and polar molecules (like sugars) exhibit higher values in this property space.
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.4257947679919579
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Alcohols**: 
   - Molecules like **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptanol) and **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long-chain alcohol) have a property value of **3.25460661**. These are saturated hydrocarbons or alcohols with no significant electronegative groups.
   
2. **Alkenes and Alkynes**: 
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a value of **1.79829257**, similar to **CCCC(=O)C** (methyl ketone, 1.79829257). 
   - Alkynes (like **CCC#C**) are likely to fall in this range due to unsaturation (though slightly more polar than alkenes).

3. **Aromatic and Polar Groups**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings, halogens, or nitro groups tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.67449076** for many).
   - Simple ketones like **CC(=O)c1ccccc1** have **-0.48800349**.

4. **Small Polar Molecules**: 
   - **CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate) has **1.51236692**, suggesting esters/aldehydes are intermediate.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a terminal alkyne (1-butyne). It is unsaturated but lacks strong electronegative groups. 
- It is less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure alkanes. 
- Comparing to **CCCC(=O)C** (1.79829257) and **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1.79829257), the alkyne's triple bond will likely place it in a similar range but slightly lower due to reduced electron density compared to a carbonyl.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCC#C** is likely **~1.5 to 1.8**. A reasonable estimate is **1.79829257** (same as nonene/methyl ketone). 

However, since alkynes are slightly more polar than alkenes but less than carbonyls, a slight adjustment downward might be warranted. Given the examples, **1.51236692** (similar to **CC(C)OC=O**) is also plausible. 

Given the data, the closest match is **1.79829257**. 

**Predicted value: 1.79829257**

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.11590812147988304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~3.25460661)**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCC**, **CC(C)C(O)C(C)C**, **CCCCCOCCCC**).
   - Halogenated aliphatic compounds (e.g., **ClC(Br)Br**).
   - These molecules lack aromaticity and have flexible, non-polar or polar but simple structures.

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~1.5 to 2.0)**:
   - Molecules with aliphatic chains and polar groups (e.g., **CCCC=C**, **CCC(=O)CC**, **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC**).
   - Some cyclic or partially unsaturated structures with functional groups (e.g., **CC12CCC(=O)C=C1CCC3C2CCC4(C)C3CCC4(O)C#C**).

3. **Low Property Values (~0.0 to -0.67449076)**:
   - Aromatic rings, especially with halogens (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, **c1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C**).
   - Polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., **c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)**).
   - The value **-0.67449076** appears frequently for heavily halogenated or polycyclic aromatic systems.

4. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property value of **0.29963624**.
   - This suggests that the **P=S** group contributes to a slightly positive property value, but the presence of aromatic/Cl groups pulls it down.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has:
- An aliphatic chain (**CCOP**).
- A **P=S** group (similar to the example with **0.29963624**).
- A heavily chlorinated aromatic ring (**c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**), which is associated with low values (e.g., **-0.67449076**).

The **P=S** group may slightly increase the property, but the aromatic/Cl component will dominate, pulling it toward the lower range. The example **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (with **P=S** and aromatic/Cl) has a value of **0.29963624**, but our target molecule has more Cl substitutions, which likely further reduces the property.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the heavily chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value will likely be close to **-0.67449076** (as seen in many similar cases). The **P=S** and aliphatic chain may slightly offset this, but not enough to push it into the positive range. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain values, particularly -0.67449076, 3.25460661, and intermediate values like -0.48800349, -0.45758419, etc. The value -0.67449076 appears frequently for aromatic systems, especially those with heteroatoms (N, S, O) or halogens (Cl, Br), but without strongly polar or ionizable groups. 

The molecule in question is:  
**c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**  

### Structural features:  
1. **Aromatic ring with nitrogen (pyridine-like)**: This is similar to many molecules in the dataset with property = -0.67449076 (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`, `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Sc1ccccc1`).  
2. **Polar substituent (C(=O)NN)**: The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is polar but not strongly ionizable or charged. Similar polar but non-ionizable groups (e.g., `C=O`, `OC=O`) in the dataset often retain the -0.67449076 value unless paired with additional features (e.g., long aliphatic chains or multiple halogens).  

### Comparison to similar molecules:  
- `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (property = -0.67449076): Aromatic with polar but neutral substituents (NH2, Cl).  
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = -0.67449076): Aromatic with neutral NH2.  
- `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (property = -0.48800349): Aromatic with moderately polar methoxy and aldehyde groups. The hydrazide in our molecule is somewhat more polar than an aldehyde, but not enough to push the property far from the common -0.67449076 value.  

### Conclusion:  
The molecule is aromatic with a polar but non-ionizable substituent, closely resembling many examples with the property value **-0.67449076**. No additional features (e.g., long aliphatic chains, multiple halogens, or strong ionizable groups) are present to shift this value significantly.

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 2.670389044775181
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~3.25)**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**, **BrCBr**, **CCS**, **OC1C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**) or cyclic alkanes (e.g., **C/C1CCC(\C)CC1**) tend to have high values (~3.25). These often lack aromaticity or complex functional groups.
   - Presence of halogens (Br, I) or hydroxyl groups (OH) in simple structures also correlates with high values.

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~1.0 to ~2.0)**:
   - Molecules with moderate complexity, such as esters (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)CC**, **CCOC(=O)N**) or fused rings (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl**), have values in this range.
   - Amides or carbonyl-containing groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) also fall here.

3. **Low Property Values (~0.0 to ~-0.7)**:
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccccc1**, **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**) or nitro groups (e.g., **Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**) typically have negative values.
   - Conjugated systems or planar structures (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1**) also correlate with low values.

4. **Very Low Property Values (~-0.7)**:
   - Highly conjugated or polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, **Oc1ccncc1**) consistently show values around -0.67.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** has the following features:
- **Aliphatic chains**: **CCC** and **CCCCC1C** (suggests higher property value contribution).
- **Phosphorothioate group**: **P(=S)(OCCC)** (uncommon in examples, but similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a value of -0.060).
- **Amide group**: **C(=O)N** (similar to **CCOC(=O)N**, which has a value of 1.09).
- No aromaticity or strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl on aromatics).

Given the lack of aromaticity and presence of aliphatic chains + amide, the property value is likely in the **intermediate range (1.0 to 2.0)**. The phosphorothioate group may slightly lower the value compared to pure aliphatic amides.

### Closest Analogues:
- **CCOC(=O)N**: 1.091 (similar amide + aliphatic chain).
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: -0.060 (phosphorothioate with aromatic nitro, but our target lacks aromaticity).

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the predicted value is **~1.091**. 

However, since the phosphorothioate group is less polarizing than aromatic nitro groups and the molecule is predominantly aliphatic with an amide, a slightly higher value than 1.091 is plausible. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.578** (similar to **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO**, which also has aliphatic + carbonyl features). 

But given the simplicity of the aliphatic chains and the amide, **1.091** is more likely. 

Final answer: **1.09192229** (matching the pattern of aliphatic + amide examples). 

However, the phosphorothioate may add complexity, so rounding to **1.57801603** is also defensible. 

Given the examples, the safer bet is **1.09192229**.

   - ClCCBr (3.25460661)
   - CC(Cl)Cl (3.25460661)

   - Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O (-0.67449076)
   - Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.67449076)

3. **Other values (e.g., 1.32404766, 0.11590812, etc.)** are associated with more complex or hybrid structures (e.g., steroids, fused rings, or mixed functional groups).

### Prediction for CCCCCCCC:
The molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane) is a simple, purely aliphatic hydrocarbon with no functional groups or aromaticity. Based on the trend observed in the examples, such aliphatic chains (especially those without halogens or oxygen) consistently have a property value of **3.25460661**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCC** is:  
**3.25460661**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.512366924026521
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the given molecule, I will predict the property value for:

**Molecule:**  
`CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Steroid-like Core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (similar to some of the examples like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O`, which has a property value of **2.06092286**).  
2. **Functional Groups**:  
   - Ketone (`C=O`) at position 2 (`=CC(=O)`).  
   - Hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups at positions 1 and 4 (`CCC12O` and `C4(O)`).  
   - Alkyne (`C#C`) at the end of the structure.  
3. **Similarity to Examples**:  
   - The molecule closely resembles `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (property = **2.06092286**) but has an additional hydroxyl and an alkyne group.  
   - Another similar example is `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = **1.39106238**), which has additional polar groups.  

### Prediction:
The presence of the ketone and hydroxyl groups suggests moderate polarity, but the alkyne may slightly reduce the property value compared to purely hydroxylated steroids. Given the closest structural match and the influence of the alkyne, I predict a value slightly lower than **2.06092286** but higher than **1.39106238**.

**Predicted Property Value:** **1.85588282**  
*(This matches the value observed for another steroid-like molecule in the examples: `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` with a value of **1.85588282**.)*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.6105707092873827
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain key values, such as **-0.67449076**, **-0.45758419**, **3.25460661**, and a few others. These values seem to correlate with structural features:

1. **Highly aromatic or halogenated (Cl, Br, I, F) molecules** often have a value of **-0.67449076**.
2. **Molecules with aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCOCCO, CCCC(C)C)** tend to have **3.25460661**.
3. **Moderately polar or nitrogen-containing heterocycles** often fall around **-0.45758419**.
4. **Molecules with multiple oxygen functionalities (e.g., sugars, polyols)** sometimes have higher positive values (e.g., **2.28113825**, **2.6502284**).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

Key structural features:
- **Multiple aromatic rings** (benzene-like and fused rings).
- **Multiple methoxy (OCH₃) and hydroxyl (OH) groups**.
- **A sugar-like polyol structure** (tetrahydrofuran and pyran-like rings with multiple oxygens).
- **An ester (C=O) group**.
- **No halogens or strong electron-withdrawing groups**.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of **multiple oxygenated functionalities (polyol/sugar-like structure)** and **aromatic rings**, this molecule does not fit the simple aromatic/halogenated (-0.674) or purely aliphatic (3.254) categories. Instead, it resembles molecules like:
- **C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21** (property = **2.6502284**), which has multiple oxygenated rings.
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br** (property = **3.25460661**), which has a phosphate and multiple halogens (but the oxygen-rich part may dominate).

Since the given molecule lacks halogens but has **many oxygen atoms in a complex polyol/aromatic system**, the most reasonable prediction is a **positive value around 2.5–3.0**, similar to other oxygen-rich aliphatic or sugar-like structures.

### Final Prediction:
**2.6502284**  
*(This matches the trend for complex polyoxygenated structures in the dataset.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly -0.67449076, 3.25460661, and others. The value -0.67449076 appears frequently for aromatic compounds with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, I) or nitro groups (NO2), especially when they are attached to a benzene ring. 

The molecule in question is **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, which is chlorophenol (a phenol with a chlorine substituent). This structure is similar to many of the examples that have the property value of -0.67449076, such as:
- Clc1ccccc1I (-0.67449076)
- Fc1ccccc1 (-0.67449076)
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (-0.67449076)
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.67449076)

All these molecules share the common feature of being substituted aromatic rings with halogens or nitro groups. 

Given this pattern, the most likely property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:

**-0.67449076**

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.387544171179157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: This is similar to molecules like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` and `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, which have property values around **-0.674**.
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property = **0.163**) and `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (property = **-0.488**). Amides tend to reduce the property value (more negative).
   - **Alkyne (C#C) and ether (O)**: These are neutral or slightly polar but don't strongly correlate with extreme values in the examples.
   - **Chlorinated aliphatic chain (ClCC)**: Similar to `CCCCl` (property = **3.254**), but the presence of other polar groups likely overrides this.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analogs are chlorinated aromatics with polar substituents (e.g., amides or halogens), which typically have **negative property values** (e.g., **-0.674** for `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` or **-0.674** for `c1ccccc1`).
   - The amide group (`OC(=O)N`) may further reduce the value, but the alkyne and ether might slightly offset this.

3. **Dominant Features**:
   - The chlorinated aromatic ring is the dominant feature, and its presence alone often results in values near **-0.674**.
   - The additional polar groups (amide, alkyne, ether) may adjust this slightly, but not drastically.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the amide group, the property value is likely close to **-0.674**. The other features (alkyne, ether) are less impactful in the examples provided.

**Final Prediction**: **-0.67449076** (same as other chlorinated aromatics with polar substituents).

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.5921970431122721
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring with nitrogens, `c2cncnc2`).
2. **Chlorine substituents**: There are two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `c3ccccc3Cl`).
3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: There is a hydroxyl group attached to a central carbon that connects the three aromatic systems.
4. **Central carbon with three substituents**: The central carbon is bonded to an OH group, a chlorinated benzene ring, and a pyridine-like ring, and another chlorinated benzene ring.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Aromatic systems with halogens**: Many examples with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) have property values around **-0.674** or slightly higher (e.g., **-0.457**). The presence of multiple halogens tends to push the value toward **-0.674** unless other polar or bulky groups are present.
- **Hydroxyl group impact**: The OH group adds some polarity, but in examples like `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`, the value is **-0.674**, suggesting that OH alone doesn't significantly increase the property value unless combined with other features.
- **Pyridine-like ring (`c2cncnc2`)**: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1`) tend to have values around **-0.674**, but if they are part of a more complex system, the value may be slightly less negative (e.g., `CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C` has **-0.223**).
- **Bulky/steric effects**: The central carbon with three large substituents (two aromatic rings and OH) introduces steric bulk, which in some cases (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) can lead to higher values, but here the aromaticity and halogens dominate.

### Most Similar Examples:
1. `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a value of **-0.457**, which is slightly higher than **-0.674** due to the bulky central carbon and multiple halogens.
2. `ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has **-0.674**, suggesting that even with multiple halogens and aromaticity, the value can remain at **-0.674** if the structure is symmetric and lacks additional polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- Two chlorinated aromatic rings,
- A pyridine-like nitrogen-containing ring,
- A hydroxyl group,
- A bulky central carbon,

the molecule is most similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (**-0.457**) but with additional nitrogen and OH effects. The nitrogen and OH might slightly lower the value, but the overall bulk and halogens suggest it will not be as low as **-0.674**.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** is **-0.45758419**. 

(Note: This matches the pattern of similar bulky, halogenated aromatic systems in the examples.)

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 1.7982925708997806
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. 

The molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate) has the following characteristics:
1. It contains an ester functional group (**-COO-**), similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate), which has a property value of **2.00447284**.
2. The chain length (butyl group) is similar to other aliphatic compounds like **CCCCBr** (butyl bromide), which has a property value of **3.25460661**, but the presence of the polar ester group likely reduces the value compared to a simple alkyl halide.
3. The ester group is less polar than a simple aldehyde (**CCCCCC=O**, hexanal, property value **2.00447284**), but the chain length is shorter.

Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCOC=O** is most similar to other aliphatic esters or aldehydes with comparable chain lengths. 

**Predicted property value: 2.00447284** (same as **CCCC(=O)OCC** and **CCCCCC=O**, due to similar polarity and chain length effects).

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. 

### Observations:
1. **Simple halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `ClCCCl`, `CCBr`, `CNN`, `CCCC`, `CCCCCCCCBr`) consistently have a property value of **3.25460661**. These molecules are small, non-polar, and contain halogens or simple alkyl/amine groups.
2. **Dichloromethane (`ClCCl`)** is structurally similar to `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane) and other simple halogenated alkanes like `CCBr` or `ClCCCl`. It is a small, non-polar molecule with halogens.

### Prediction:
Since `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) fits the pattern of simple halogenated alkanes, its predicted property value is the same as the other similar molecules in the dataset: **3.25460661**.

### Final Answer:

==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.25186115933029796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - Molecules like `Oc1ccccc1` (phenol), `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol), and `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (a substituted phenol) have property values of **-0.67449076**, **-0.67449076**, and **0.11590812**, respectively.
   - The presence of an -OH group on an aromatic ring tends to give a value around **-0.67449076**, but substitutions can shift this (e.g., alkyl groups may increase the value slightly, as seen with `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` at **0.11590812**).

2. **Alkyl-Substituted Phenols**:
   - The molecule `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` has two methyl groups and a hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring, yielding **0.11590812**.
   - The molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is similar but with two methyl groups in different positions (ortho or meta to the -OH). This structural similarity suggests its value should be close to **0.11590812**, possibly slightly lower due to less steric or electronic effects from the methyl groups.

3. **Other Trends**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains or non-aromatic structures often have higher values (e.g., **3.25460661** or **2.00447284**), while aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., -NO2, -SO2, halogens) tend to have negative values.
   - The -OH group on an aromatic ring is a strong determinant, and additional alkyl groups modestly increase the value.

### Prediction for `Cc1cccc(C)c1O`:
This is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol or similar). Given the examples:
- `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (a more substituted phenol) has **0.11590812**.
- Simpler phenols like `Oc1ccccc1` have **-0.67449076**.

The two methyl groups in `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` are less sterically bulky than in `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`, so the value should be slightly lower than **0.11590812** but higher than **-0.67449076**. A reasonable estimate is around **-0.1 to 0.0**.

Looking for the closest match in the examples, `CN(C)C(=O)Oc1cc(C)nn1c2ccccc2` has **-0.29191574**, which is somewhat similar in complexity. However, since `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is simpler and more similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`, I predict a value slightly lower than **0.11590812**, such as **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is **0.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value **-0.67449076** appears frequently for molecules with the following characteristics:  

1. **Highly halogenated (especially chlorine-substituted) aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl`).  
2. **Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`).  
3. **Nitro (NO₂) or strongly electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, `Clc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`).  

The molecule in question, **`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`**, fits the first category perfectly:  
- It is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with multiple chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings.  
- The symmetry and high degree of halogenation match other examples where the property is **-0.67449076**.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.67449076**  

This aligns with the observed trend that heavily chlorinated aromatic systems consistently yield this value in the given dataset.

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.8000971530170674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property value = **3.25460661**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon): Property value = **3.25460661**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property value = **1.79829257**
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property value = **2.28113825**
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a small branched alkene (4 carbons), similar in structure to some of the above but smaller and less saturated.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2, -C=O) tend to have lower (often negative) property values.
   - Pure hydrocarbons (especially branched or long chains) tend to have higher positive values.

3. **Double Bonds**:
   - The presence of a double bond (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**) reduces the property value compared to fully saturated analogs (e.g., **CCCCCCCC**).

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids or polycyclic structures) tend to have higher values if they are hydrocarbons but lower if they contain polar groups.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- This is a small, branched alkene (4 carbons). 
- Compared to **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene, value = 1.79829257), **CC=C(C)C** is much smaller and less hydrophobic, so its value should be lower.
- Compared to **CC(C)=CC3C(...)** (value = -0.02397986), which has additional complexity and polar groups, **CC=C(C)C** is simpler and non-polar, so its value should be higher.
- The closest analog is likely **CCCC=C** (not in the examples, but similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C**), which would have a value between 1.0 and 2.0. Given the small size of **CC=C(C)C**, a reasonable estimate is slightly lower than **CCCCCCCCC=C**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CC=C(C)C** is approximately **1.5**. 

However, looking more closely, **O=C1CCCN1** (a cyclic amide) has a value of 1.51236692, and **CC=C(C)C** is a simpler hydrocarbon, so a slightly higher value might be expected. But since it's small and branched, a value around **1.8** (similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C**) seems plausible, though likely slightly lower due to smaller size.

After reconsidering, a more precise estimate is **1.6**.

### Predicted Property Value for **CC=C(C)C**: **1.6**

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain numbers, particularly **3.25460661** for aliphatic hydrocarbons and simple alcohols/ethers, and **-0.67449076** for highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) aromatic or aliphatic structures.

The molecule in question is **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH₂Cl₂), which is a simple aliphatic chlorinated compound. 

Looking at similar structures in the dataset:
- **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **-0.67449076**.
- **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) also has **-0.67449076**.
- **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a highly chlorinated aliphatic structure) has **1.79829257**, but this is more complex.

Given that **ClCCl** is a smaller, less heavily chlorinated molecule compared to the examples with **-0.67449076**, its value is likely less extreme. However, the dataset does not contain a perfect analog. 

The closest simple chlorinated aliphatic example is **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** with **-0.67449076**, but **ClCCl** has fewer chlorines. If we consider that **C=CCS(=O)SCC=C** (a non-halogenated but polar molecule) has **-0.06045323**, **ClCCl** might fall somewhere between these two. 

Given the strong trend toward **-0.67449076** for chlorinated compounds, even smaller ones, I predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.67449076**  

This aligns with the recurring value for chlorinated structures in the dataset, even if the exact molecule isn't present.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value tends to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple alkanes and alcohols** (e.g., `CC(C)(C)CO`, `ClCC`, `C1CCOCC1`) tend to have a high property value of **3.25460661**.
2. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions** (e.g., `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1`, `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
3. **Molecules with carbonyl groups (ketones, esters, amides)** often have intermediate values (e.g., `CCC(=O)C` = 1.51236692, `CC(=O)C(C)(C)C` = 2.00447284).
4. **Complex aromatic systems with heteroatoms or substitutions** often have negative values (e.g., `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` = -0.67449076, `Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13` = -0.5805175).

The molecule in question is:  
**`Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl`**  

This is a **chlorinated phenol** (specifically, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol). Structurally, it resembles other halogenated aromatic compounds like `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` and `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl`, which both have a property value of **-0.67449076**.  

Given the consistent pattern for halogenated aromatics in the dataset, the predicted property value for `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl` is:  

**-0.67449076**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.6105707092873827
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **High values (~3.25)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CO`, `CCCCl`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
   - Small polar molecules with hydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC(O)CO`).
   - Cyclic alkanes (e.g., `CC1CCCC1`).

2. **Intermediate values (~0.5 to ~2.1)** are associated with:
   - Complex cyclic structures with multiple functional groups (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` gives ~1.86).
   - Sugars or polyols (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` gives ~3.25, but some complex cases like `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` give ~1.09).

3. **Low values (~-0.06 to ~-0.67)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic rings, especially with electronegative substituents (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` gives ~-0.67).
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), halogens (Cl, Br), or sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `Sc1ccccc1` gives ~-0.67).
   - Small conjugated systems (e.g., `C#C` gives ~-0.67).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Key features:
- It is a **highly complex polycyclic structure** with multiple fused rings.
- Contains **multiple oxygen-containing functional groups** (methoxy `OCH3`, hydroxyl `OH`, carbonyl `C=O`, and ether `O` linkages).
- Includes **sugar-like moieties** (e.g., `OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) and **aromatic rings** (e.g., `c1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`).
- No strongly electronegative groups (like nitro or halogens) dominate the structure.

### Prediction:
Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygenated groups (similar to sugar-like structures in the examples), the property value is likely in the **intermediate range**. 

Comparing to similar examples:
- `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a sugar) gives ~3.25, but this is simpler.
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (a steroid-like structure) gives ~1.86.
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (a fused polycyclic system) gives ~1.09.

The target molecule is even more complex, with aromatic and sugar-like parts, but lacks strongly polarizing groups (like nitro or halogens). Thus, the value is likely **between 1.0 and 2.0**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~1.66787601**  
(Similar to `CCCC(C)(COC(N)=O)COC(N)=O`, which is also a complex, oxygen-rich structure.) 

However, given the steroid-like core and sugar attachments, another close match is ~1.85588282 (from `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`). 

Final prediction:  
**~1.85588282** (closer to the steroid-like examples).

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.9052497606923283
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C`, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **High Positive Values (~3.25460661)**:
   - Small, non-aromatic molecules with halogens (e.g., `CC(C)Br`, `ClC(Br)Br`) or simple alcohols/ethers (e.g., `CO`, `CC1CCCO1`).
   - These are typically very small or highly halogenated/aliphatic.

2. **Intermediate Positive Values (~0.5 to ~2.5)**:
   - Larger aliphatic chains or functionalized aliphatics (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC` at 2.00447284, `CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1` at 2.52426667).
   - Heterocycles with bulky alkyl groups (e.g., `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` at 1.25220529).

3. **Near-Zero to Slightly Negative Values**:
   - Aromatic systems with polar substituents or moderate complexity (e.g., `C1Cc2ccccc2C1` at -0.06045323, `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` at -0.17350217).

4. **Highly Negative Values (~-0.67449076)**:
   - Predominantly aromatic/heteroaromatic systems, especially with halogens or nitro groups (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`, `c1ccncc1`, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).

### Analysis of Target Molecule: `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C`
- **Structure**: 
  - A thiol-substituted (`CS-`) heterocycle (imidazole-like, `nnc(=O)nN`) with a bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`).
  - Contains both aromatic (imidazole) and aliphatic (tert-butyl) components, with polar groups (`C=O`, `NH`).
- **Analogous Examples**:
  - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (value: 1.25220529) is structurally similar: a heterocycle with a bulky alkyl group and polar substituents. This suggests a positive value.
  - The presence of the thiol (`CS-`) might slightly lower the value compared to the above example, but the tert-butyl group and heterocycle dominate.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (1.25220529) but with a less polar thiol substituent, the value is expected to be slightly lower but still positive. 

**Final Prediction**: `1.09192229` (matching the range of similar heterocycles with bulky alkyl groups).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.30925613034481086
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes, alcohols, and ethers (e.g., CC, CCO, CCOH) tend to have high positive values around 3.25460661
2. Aromatic systems (especially those with heteroatoms or conjugated systems) tend to have negative values around -0.67449076
3. Molecules with ester groups (R-COO-R') tend to have intermediate positive values (e.g., 2.15989687 for CCCC(=O)OC)

The molecule in question: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester (ethyl benzoate) with:
- An ethyl group (CCO-)
- An ester linkage (-OC(=O)-)
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCCC(=O)OC (butyl acetate) has 2.15989687
- CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate) has 2.15989687
- COCC(=O)N(...) has 0.31593264 (though more complex)
- The phenyl ring alone would suggest a negative value, but the ester functionality dominates

Given that our molecule is an aromatic ester, but simpler than most in the examples, I would predict a value slightly lower than the aliphatic esters but still positive. The closest analog is probably the butyl acetate/ethyl butyrate examples.

Predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: 2.00447284

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aliphatic chains with polar end groups (like -OH, -Br, -I, -NO2, or -SS-) tend to have high property values around **3.25460661** (e.g., CSSC, OCC(O)C(O)CO, CCN(=O)=O, CI, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC, O=N(=O)OCC(CON(=O)=O)ON(=O)=O, CCCCCCCCO).

2. Molecules with aromatic rings, especially those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -Cl, -NO2, -SO2-), tend to have negative property values, often **-0.67449076** (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, NC(=O)c1ccccc1, Nc1ccccc1O, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1).

3. Aliphatic chains with carbonyl groups (C=O) or other moderately polar features tend to have intermediate positive values (e.g., CCCC(=O)CCC: 2.15989687, CCCCCC(=O)C: 2.15989687, CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1=O: 2.45789431).

The molecule in question, **CCCCCCCBr**, is a simple aliphatic chain (heptyl group) with a polar bromine (-Br) terminus. From the examples, similar structures like **CI (3.25460661)** and **CCCCCCCO (3.25460661)** suggest that terminal halogens or hydroxyl groups on aliphatic chains correlate with the high property value of **3.25460661**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is:  
**3.25460661**

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple alkanes and alcohols** (e.g., `CCC`, `CCC(C)CO`, `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O`, `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O`) tend to have a property value of **3.25460661**. These molecules are generally small, non-polar or polar with hydroxyl groups, and lack complex functional groups.

2. **Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, or highly polar/charged groups** (e.g., `CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O`, `NC(N)=NC#N`, `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O`) tend to have **negative property values**, often around **-0.67449076**.

3. **Molecules with moderate polarity or mixed functional groups** (e.g., `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`, `COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1`) have intermediate values like **-0.48800349** or **-0.15428388**.

4. **Molecules with aldehydes or simple unsaturated hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCCOC=O`, `CC1=CCCCC1`) have **positive values** (e.g., **1.79829257**, **1.32404766**).

### Prediction for `CO` (methanol):
- `CO` is a very simple alcohol, similar to the small alkanes/alcohols in the dataset (e.g., `CCC`, `CCC(C)CO`). These all share the property value **3.25460661**.
- Methanol is polar due to the hydroxyl group but lacks complex functional groups or aromaticity, aligning with the trend for small alcohols.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CO` is:  
**3.25460661**.
