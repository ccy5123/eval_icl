SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.9090909090909091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**
   - `CC=C`: 0.33333333 (unsaturated hydrocarbon)
   - `CCCC`: 1.0 (butane, fully saturated)
   - `CCCCCC`: 1.0 (hexane, fully saturated)
   - `CCCCCCCC(C)O`: 1.0 (long saturated chain with a hydroxyl group)
   - `CCCCCCC(C)O`: 1.0 (similar to above)
   - `CC(C)C`: 1.0 (branched alkane)
   - `CC(C)=CCCC(O)(C)C=C`: 0.6 (unsaturated and branched with hydroxyl)
   - `CCC1CCCCC1`: 1.0 (cyclohexane with ethyl group)

   Fully saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) or those with a single hydroxyl group (`-OH`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.

2. **Esters (`-COOR`):**
   - `CCOC(=O)CC`: 0.8 (ethyl propanoate)
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`: This is methyl decanoate (ester with a long hydrocarbon chain).
   - Another ester example: `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the given examples, but the exact match isn't present. However, `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl octanoate) would likely follow the same trend as other esters.

   Esters with long hydrocarbon chains seem to have high property values, close to 1.0 but slightly less due to the polar ester group. For example:
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate) is similar to `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl octanoate), which isn't directly in the examples, but `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is very close to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (given as 0.92307692 in the examples).

3. **Other Functional Groups:**
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br), nitro groups (`-NO2`), or multiple heteroatoms (N, S, O) tend to have lower property values (often 0.0 or close to it).
   - Aromatic systems with polar groups also tend to have lower values.

### Prediction for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`:
This is methyl decanoate, an ester with a long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons). Given that:
- `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate) is structurally similar to `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl octanoate), which isn't directly in the examples, but `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is given as 0.92307692 in the examples (this is likely methyl laurate, C12 ester).
- The property value seems to increase with chain length for esters, approaching 1.0 but slightly less due to the ester group's polarity.

Given the trend, `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate, C11) would likely have a property value slightly less than `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (0.92307692, likely C12). 

Thus, a reasonable prediction is: **0.9** (or more precisely, interpolating between C8 and C12 esters, likely ~0.9).

However, in the examples, `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (which is likely `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, methyl laurate, C12) is given as 0.92307692. Since `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is C11, it would be very close, perhaps **0.90909091** (10/11, similar to the trend).

But since the exact match isn't present, the closest is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` at 0.92307692, so for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (C11), I'll predict: **0.90909091** (10/11).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is **0.90909091**.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a chlorinated heterocyclic compound with the following features:
1. A **benzene ring** substituted with a chlorine atom (`Cl` attached to the benzene ring).
2. A **fused lactam ring** (`oc(=O)[nH]`), which is a cyclic amide (similar to uracil or barbiturates in the examples).
   - The lactam ring has a carbonyl (`C=O`) and an NH group, making it polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (fully chlorinated biphenyl): Property = 0.0.
   - `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (pentachlorophenol): Property = 0.0.
   - These suggest that heavily chlorinated aromatics tend to have low (often 0.0) property values.

2. **Heterocyclic Lactams/Amides**:
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (barbiturate-like): Property = 0.0.
   - `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (chlorinated uracil derivative): Property = 0.555.
   - Lactams/amides with additional substitutions (like alkyl groups) seem to have higher values, while simple ones are lower.

3. **Chlorinated + Heterocyclic**:
   - The given molecule combines a chlorinated benzene with a lactam ring. The closest analog is the chlorinated uracil derivative (`Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C`), which has a value of 0.555. However, our molecule lacks the bulky `C(C)(C)C` group, which likely reduces steric effects and may lower the property.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of chlorine on the aromatic ring tends to reduce the property (many chlorinated aromatics have 0.0).
- The lactam ring introduces polarity, but its impact depends on substitutions. Here, it's unsubstituted except for the fusion to the benzene ring.
- The molecule is somewhat similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (property = 0.0) but with a chlorinated benzene instead of a second amide.

### Prediction:
Given the chlorinated aromatic core and the simple fused lactam, the property is likely **low**. The closest matches suggest values between 0.0 and 0.333. Since the lactam is not heavily substituted, I lean toward the lower end.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains with Halogens or Terminal Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules like `CCCOCC`, `CCCCCl`, `CCI`, `CCCCCBr`, `ClCC`, and `CCC(C)CC` have property values of **1.0**. These are typically simple, flexible, and non-aromatic with halogens or simple functional groups.
   - `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is also a simple aliphatic structure with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is a terminal functional group similar to halogens in terms of being a substituent.

2. **Nitro-Containing Compounds**:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a nitro group and a property value of **0.5**.
   - However, this molecule is more complex (heterocyclic with multiple substituents), so the nitro group alone doesn't necessarily lower the value to 0.5.

3. **Simple Nitroalkanes**:
   - `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is a simple nitroalkane (tert-butyl nitro compound). Given that simple aliphatic chains with terminal functional groups (like halogens) tend to have a value of 1.0, and nitro is similarly a terminal group, it is reasonable to assign a high value.

4. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic or conjugated systems often have lower values (e.g., many are 0.0), while aliphatic systems with simple substituents tend to have higher values.

### Conclusion:
The molecule `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is a simple aliphatic nitro compound, structurally similar to other simple aliphatic molecules with terminal functional groups that have a property value of **1.0**. The nitro group is not expected to significantly reduce the value in this context.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.0**

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.8095238095238095
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Features**:
   - The molecule contains multiple rings (steroid-like structure with fused cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings).
   - It has hydroxyl (`OH`), carbonyl (`C=O`), and alcohol (`CO`) groups.
   - The structure is complex with significant branching and rigidity.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with rigid, polycyclic structures (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) tend to have **low property values (0.0 or close to 0)** unless they have highly polar or flexible substituents.
   - Molecules with **hydroxyl (`OH`) and carbonyl (`C=O`) groups** (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`, property = 0.80952381) can have higher values if the structure is not overly rigid or aromatic.
   - The given molecule has both rigid rings and flexible/aliphatic parts (e.g., `C(=O)CO`), which may increase the property value compared to purely aromatic systems.

3. **Specific Similar Example**:
   - The closest example is `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property = 0.80952381), which shares:
     - A steroid-like core with fused rings.
     - Carbonyl groups (`C=O`).
     - No heavy halogens or aromatic systems dominating the structure.
   - The given molecule has an additional hydroxyl (`OH`) and a `C(=O)CO` group, which may slightly reduce the property value compared to the example (due to increased polarity/rigidity).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to the example with property = 0.80952381 but with slightly more polar groups, the predicted value would be **slightly lower**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75**  

### Rationale:
- The steroid-like core with carbonyl groups suggests a high value (~0.8), but the additional polar groups (`OH` and `C(=O)CO`) may reduce it slightly.
- The value 0.75 balances the contributions from the flexible/aliphatic parts and the polar substituents. 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where rigid polycyclic structures with polar groups have intermediate values (e.g., 0.80952381 for the similar steroid-like molecule).

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), connected by a urea-like linker **C(=O)NC(=O)N**.
2. **Substituents**:
   - Fluorine atoms on one ring (**Fc1cccc(F)c1**).
   - Chlorine atom on the other ring (**c2ccc(Cl)cc2**).
   - Polar urea-like linker (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**), which is highly polar and likely to reduce the property value.
3. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Both fluorine and chlorine are electron-withdrawing, and the urea linker is also electron-withdrawing/polar.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl or Br) on aromatic rings tend to have low or zero property values (e.g., **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** = 0.0, **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** = 0.0, **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** = 0.0).
- The urea-like linker (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**) is similar to polar/heterocyclic linkers in other molecules (e.g., **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** = 0.0, **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** = 0.0), which also correspond to low/zero property values.
- The presence of fluorine does not seem to increase the property value when combined with other polar features (e.g., **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** = 0.14285714, but this is still low).

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of:
- Multiple halogens (F and Cl) on aromatic rings,
- A highly polar urea-like linker, and
- The general trend that such features correspond to low/zero property values in the examples,

the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Flexible, Aliphatic Chains with Oxygen (e.g., Alcohols, Ethers):**
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(O)CC**, **CCOC(=O)CC**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, **CCCCCO**, and **CCCC(C)(O)CC** have property values of **1.0** or close to it (e.g., **0.8**, **0.9**). These are typically simple aliphatic chains with oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers) and no rigid or aromatic components.
   - The presence of oxygen (especially in alcohols or ethers) and the absence of rings/aromaticity seem to correlate with higher property values.

2. **Rigid or Aromatic Structures:**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings, halogens, or other rigid features (e.g., **Clc1cccc(I)c1**, **Oc1ccccc1O**, **Nc3nc(N)c2nc(c1ccccc1)c(N)nc2n3**) tend to have property values of **0.0** or very low values.
   - The property value decreases with increasing rigidity or aromaticity.

3. **Intermediate Cases:**
   - Molecules with a mix of aliphatic and aromatic components (e.g., **CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2**) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.38461538**).
   - The presence of small rings or partial flexibility can lead to values between 0 and 1.

### Analysis of **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a simple aliphatic ether with no rings or aromaticity: **CCCOC(C)C** (structure: propyl isopropyl ether).
- It is highly flexible, similar to molecules like **CCOC(=O)CC** (property = 0.8) or **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (property = 1.0).
- The oxygen (ether) and lack of rigidity suggest a high property value, likely close to 1.0.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong correlation between simple aliphatic oxygen-containing compounds and high property values, the predicted property for **CCCOC(C)C** is:

**1.0**

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.5555555555555556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and heavy halogen substitution (e.g., Cl, Br) tend to have a property value of 0.0. Examples:
     - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorinated biphenyl)
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (dichlorinated biphenyl)
     - `Nc1nccs1` (thiazole with no halogens)
   - Highly conjugated or polycyclic aromatic systems without polar groups also tend to have 0.0.

2. **Property = 1.0**: 
   - Simple aliphatic chains, especially those with heteroatoms like O or S but no aromaticity or halogens. Examples:
     - `CC(C)SC(C)C` (branched thioether)
     - `CCC(C)CC` (branched alkane)
     - `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (carbon tetrachloride, fully halogenated but non-aromatic).

3. **Intermediate Values (0.1–0.9)**:
   - Molecules with mixed features (e.g., aromatic + aliphatic, halogens + polar groups) tend to have intermediate values. For example:
     - `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)C(F)(F)F)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2` (complex structure with Cl, F, ester, nitrile, and ether) → 0.304.
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (brominated aromatic with amide) → 0.125.
     - `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (ester with long aliphatic chain) → 0.857.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**. Its features include:
- A **brominated heterocycle** (bromine attached to an aromatic ring).
- Two **carbonyl groups (C=O)** in the ring (highly polar).
- A **branched aliphatic chain (CCC(C))** attached to the ring.
- No fused aromatic systems or multiple heavy halogens.

### Comparison with Examples:
1. The presence of a **single Br** on an aromatic ring is seen in:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` → property = 0.125.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → property = 0.0 (but this has two Cl atoms).
   - `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → property = 0.142 (one Cl + polar methoxy).
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` → property = 0.066 (complex but with Cl and polar groups).

2. The **branched aliphatic chain (CCC(C))** is similar to `CCC(C)CC` → property = 1.0, but here it's attached to a polar heterocycle.

3. The **two carbonyl groups** increase polarity, similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` → property = 0.625 (but this has more aliphatic character).

### Prediction:
The molecule has:
- A single Br (reducing property value compared to aliphatic molecules).
- Polar carbonyl groups (increasing property value compared to non-polar aromatics).
- A branched aliphatic chain (increasing property value).

Given these competing effects, the property value is likely **intermediate**, similar to molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.125) or `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.142). However, the additional carbonyl and aliphatic chain might push it slightly higher.

### Final Prediction:
**Property value = 0.2** (approximately between 0.125 and 0.25, reflecting the balance of polar groups and halogen substitution). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is, for example, solubility or bioactivity, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Fully saturated hydrocarbons or simple halogenated alkanes** tend to have high property values (close to 1.0):
   - **CCCCCCC** (heptane): 1.0
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 1.0
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride): 1.0
   - **CO** (methanol): 1.0

2. **Aromatic systems with no polar substituents** tend to have low property values (often 0.0 or close to 0.0):
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (large polycyclic aromatic): 0.0
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (aromatic with amine): 0.0
   - **c2(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1nccnc1c2(Cl)** (chlorinated heterocycle): 0.0

3. **Biphenyl-like structures**:
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted biphenyl-like): 0.16666667
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (partially saturated biphenyl-like): 0.4

4. **Polar or functionalized aromatics** often have intermediate values:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (sulfonamide): 0.0
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 0.0

### Analysis of **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl):
- This is a simple **biphenyl** structure with no polar substituents or functional groups.
- It is purely aromatic, similar to the large polycyclic aromatic example (which scored 0.0).
- The methyl-substituted biphenyl-like structure (**Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C**) scored 0.16666667, but the unsubstituted biphenyl is even less polar/functionalized.
- Given the trend, purely aromatic systems with no polar groups tend to score **0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0** (consistent with the behavior of other unfunctionalized aromatic systems in the examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)**:
   - Saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1**, **CCC1CCCCC1**, **CCCCCC(C)C**) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
   - Unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**) have lower values (e.g., 0.66666667).
   - Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1**, **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**) tend to have **0.0** or very low values.

2. **Heteroatoms (O, N, S, Cl, etc.)**:
   - The presence of heteroatoms generally reduces the property value, especially if they are electronegative (e.g., Cl, O, N).
   - Sulfur (S) appears in some molecules (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** with 0.66666667, **CCNC(=S)NCC** with 0.8). The property value depends on the context, but sulfur doesn't always lead to a value of 0.

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - Thiols (R-SH) or thioethers (R-S-R') are not explicitly present in the examples, but sulfur-containing molecules show variability (e.g., 0.0 to 0.8).
   - Simple aliphatic thiols (like **CCCCS**) are not directly represented, but analogous aliphatic chains with heteroatoms (e.g., **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** with 0.3) suggest intermediate values.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Smaller, less polar molecules (e.g., **CC(C)I** with 1.0) tend to have higher values.
   - Larger or more polar molecules (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** with 0.0) tend to have lower values.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- **CCCCS** is a small aliphatic thiol (4-carbon chain with a terminal -SH group).
- It is not highly polar (like Cl or NO2-substituted aromatics) and lacks aromaticity.
- Similar molecules (e.g., **CCNC(=S)NCC** with 0.8, **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** with 0.66666667) suggest that sulfur doesn't necessarily drive the value to 0.
- The property value is likely intermediate, similar to other small heteroatom-containing aliphatics (e.g., **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** with 0.3).

Given the lack of exact matches, a reasonable estimate would be **0.7** (closer to the sulfur-containing aliphatic examples with higher values).

### Final Answer:
**0.7**
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Branched Alkanes with Hydroxyl Groups (-OH):**
   - Molecules like **CCCC(C)(O)CC** and **CC(C)CC(C)O** have a property value of **1.0**.
   - These are branched alkanes with a hydroxyl group, and they consistently show a high property value (1.0).

2. **Linear or Less Branched Alkanes with Hydroxyl Groups:**
   - **CCCCOC** (an ether, not a direct -OH analog) has a value of 1.0, but this is an ether, not an alcohol.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (no -OH) also has 1.0, but this is purely a branched alkane without functional groups.

3. **Presence of -OH Group:**
   - The hydroxyl group seems to strongly correlate with higher property values, especially in branched alkanes.

4. **Branched vs. Linear:**
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**, **CC(C)C**) tend to have higher property values, especially when combined with -OH.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- The structure is a branched alkane with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the end: **CCCC(C)(C)CO**.
- It is very similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = 1.0) and **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property = 1.0), which are branched alkanes with -OH.
- The branching and -OH group are present, which aligns perfectly with the examples that have a property value of 1.0.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong correlation between branched alkanes with -OH groups and the property value of 1.0 in the examples, the predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is:

**1.0**

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems:**
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, `c1ccccc1`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless substituted with functional groups.
   - Substituted aromatic systems often have higher values depending on the substituents. For example:
     - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (two methyl groups on benzene) has a value of **0.33333333**.
     - `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` (three methyl groups on benzene) also has a value of **0.33333333**.
     - `Cc1ccc(C)cc1` (two methyl groups on benzene) has a value of **0.25**.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems:**
   - `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a naphthalene derivative with one methyl group) has a value of **0.06666667**.
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (a naphthalene derivative with two methyl groups) has a value of **0.16666667**.
   - `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` (a fused aromatic system with multiple substituents) has a value of **0.5**.

3. **Molecule in Question:**
   - The molecule `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is a naphthalene derivative with one methyl group attached to the first ring. This is structurally similar to `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (property = **0.06666667**), but with slightly fewer substituents or complexity.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple naphthalene (`c1ccc2ccccc2c1`) would likely have a value of **0.0** (similar to benzene).
- Adding one methyl group (as in `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) would increase the value slightly, but not as much as adding more substituents or functional groups.

The closest analog is `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (property = **0.06666667`), but `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is slightly simpler (no additional fused ring), so the value might be slightly lower. However, since the examples show that even small changes can lead to non-linear differences, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.06666667** (same as the closest analog). 

Alternatively, if we consider that `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is simpler than `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1`, we might predict a slightly lower value, such as **0.05**, but this is speculative. Given the data, **0.06666667** is the most justifiable answer.

### Final Answer:
**0.06666667**

Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.5833333333333334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Typically associated with aromatic rings (especially with halogens like Cl, Br, I), nitro groups (NO2), or highly conjugated systems without significant flexibility or aliphatic components.
   - Example: `Clc1ccccc1`, `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`.

2. **Property = 1.0**: 
   - Associated with small, fully aliphatic molecules (no rings, no conjugation, no polar groups beyond simple halogens or alcohols).
   - Example: `CC(C)C`, `ClCCl`, `CC(C)CO`, `CNN`.

3. **Intermediate Values (0.1–0.9)**:
   - Molecules with mixed features: aliphatic chains + rings, partial flexibility, or polar groups.
   - Example: `CCSSCC` (1.0, but `CCCC=CC` is 0.666 due to unsaturation), `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` (0.375).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**

- **Structure**: It has a cyclic imide core (`O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1`) with two carbonyls and two amide nitrogens (similar to the example `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C`, which has a property of 0.375).
- **Substituents**: 
  - A branched aliphatic chain (`C(C)CCC`) and an alkenyl group (`CC=C`), adding flexibility but not as much as a fully aliphatic molecule.
- **Comparison**: 
  - The example `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` (smaller substituent: `C)CC=C`) has a property of 0.375.
  - This molecule has a larger substituent (`C(C)CCC`), which adds more aliphatic character but retains the cyclic imide's rigidity.

### Prediction:
The additional aliphatic chain (`C(C)CCC`) will increase the property value slightly compared to the example with `C)CC=C` (0.375). However, the cyclic imide core still dominates, limiting the increase. 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.45** (between 0.375 and 0.5). 

Given the examples, the closest match is likely **0.4** (rounded from 0.45 to align with the observed granularity in the data). 

However, since the example with a smaller substituent is 0.375, and this has more aliphatic character, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 0.4** (or 0.42857143 if interpolating more finely, but 0.4 is a cleaner fit). 

Given the provided examples, the most precise match would be **0.42857143** (similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`). 

But for simplicity, **0.4** is a reasonable approximation. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest structural analog (`O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C`) is 0.375, and adding more aliphatic chains (like `CCCC`) in other examples increases the value. Thus, a more precise prediction is **0.42857143**. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.42857143**

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.14285714285714285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly hydrophobic/aliphatic molecules** (e.g., **CCCCC**, **CCO**, **CC(C)CCO**) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Aromatic rings without polar substituents** (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**) have a value of **0.0**.
3. **Aromatic rings with polar or electronegative substituents** (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**, **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**) also have a value of **0.0**.
4. **Molecules with moderate polarity or mixed features** (e.g., **COC(=O)c1cccnc1**, **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.14285714**, **0.18181818**).
5. **The trifluoromethyl group (-CF3)** is highly electronegative and polar, similar to halogens (Cl, Br, I), which tend to push the property toward **0.0** when attached to an aromatic ring.

### Analysis of **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**:
- The molecule consists of a benzene ring with a **-CF3** group, which is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.
- This is analogous to molecules like **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** or **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**, which have a property value of **0.0**.
- No other functional groups or aliphatic chains are present to increase the property value.

### Conclusion:
The property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is most likely **0.0**, consistent with other aromatic systems bearing highly polar/electronegative substituents.

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with the presence of hydroxyl (-OH) groups and the overall hydrophilicity or hydrogen-bonding capacity of the molecule. 

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). It has **five hydroxyl groups** and an oxygen in the ring, making it highly hydrophilic and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a linear polyol like mannitol) has a property value of **1.0**.
- **CC(C)C(C)O** (a simple alcohol with two -OH groups) also has a property value of **1.0**.
- **CCC(C)(O)CC** (a tertiary alcohol) has a property value of **1.0**.
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol, with two -OH groups) has a property value of **0.0**, but this is likely due to the aromatic system reducing the effect compared to aliphatic polyols.

Given that the molecule is a **cyclic polyol with five -OH groups**, similar to the linear polyol with a value of **1.0**, the predicted property value is:

### **1.0**

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 0.6956521739130435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to identify patterns or trends.

### Given Molecule:
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains multiple carbonyl groups (C=O), hydroxyl groups (OH), and ester-like linkages (CC(=O)OCC(=O)...).
   - It has a complex polycyclic structure with fused rings (steroid-like or terpene-like backbone).

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, carbonyls) often have intermediate property values (e.g., 0.6–0.9), unless they are heavily halogenated or aromatic (which tend to lower the value).
   - Example: **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has a value of **0.81818182**. This is structurally similar to the given molecule but lacks some of the additional polar groups (e.g., the extra C=O and OH in the given molecule).
   - Example: **OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O** has a value of **0.65**. This is a highly polar molecule with multiple hydroxyl groups, similar to the given molecule's polarity.

3. **Steroid/Terpene-Like Structures**:
   - Example: **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **0.85**. This is a simpler steroid-like structure with fewer polar groups than the given molecule.
   - The given molecule has more polar groups (additional C=O and OH), which might slightly lower the value compared to this example.

4. **Impact of Additional Polar Groups**:
   - The given molecule has more polar groups than **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (0.81818182)**, but fewer than **OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O (0.65)**. Thus, the value is likely between these two.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the given molecule's property value is likely slightly lower than **0.81818182** due to the additional polar groups but higher than **0.65** due to the steroid-like backbone. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75** (or 3/4, matching the trend of similar molecules). 

### Justification:
- The molecule is highly functionalized with polar groups (C=O, OH), but the steroid-like core contributes to a higher value.
- The closest analog is **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (0.81818182)**, and the additional polar groups here would slightly reduce the value to **0.75**.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.9473684210526315
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to be a fractional value between 0 and 1, likely representing some form of molecular descriptor or index (e.g., branching, polarity, or functional group contribution).

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Carbonyl (=O) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with -OH or =O often have intermediate values (e.g., 0.66666667 for **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** and **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O**).
   - The presence of both -OH and =O in a cyclic/steroid-like structure (like the given molecule) tends to yield values around **0.66666667**.

2. **Fully Saturated Hydrocarbons or Halogenated Aromatics**: 
   - These often result in 0.0 (e.g., **Brc1ccccc1**, **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**).

3. **Highly Branched Aliphatic Chains with -OH**: 
   - These tend to give 1.0 (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, **CCCCCC(O)CC**).

4. **Complex Cyclic Structures with Mixed Functional Groups**: 
   - Values are often fractional, depending on the balance of polar/nonpolar groups (e.g., **0.66666667** for steroid-like molecules with -OH and =O).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
- The structure is a **steroid-like tetracyclic system** with:
  - A **carbonyl (=O)** group at position 2 in one of the rings.
  - A **hydroxyl (-OH)** group on the terminal ring (position 4).
  - No halogens or highly polar heteroatoms (N, S, etc.).
- This is very similar to the example **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O**, which has a value of **0.66666667**.

### Conclusion:
The property value is likely **0.66666667**, as the molecule fits the pattern of steroid-like structures with both -OH and =O groups.

**Final Answer:**  
**0.66666667**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group directly attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12`, `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) tend to have **low property values (0.0 or ~0.14285714)** unless other significant functional groups are present.
   - The nitro group seems to reduce the property value significantly when it is the dominant feature.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**:
   - Molecules with an amide group (e.g., `CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has a high value of 0.90909091) often have **higher property values**, especially if the amide is part of a flexible or aliphatic chain.
   - However, when the amide is attached to an aromatic ring with a nitro group (as in the target molecule), the property value may be lowered due to the nitro group's influence.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitro or other electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`, `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3`) often have **property values of 0.0**.
   - The target molecule has both an amide and a nitro group on the aromatic ring, which may partially counteract each other's effects.

4. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a nitro group and a methoxy group, giving a property value of **0.14285714**.
   - `CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has an amide and a flexible ring, giving a high value of **0.90909091**.
   - The target molecule is intermediate: it has an amide (increasing the property) and a nitro group (decreasing the property).

### Prediction for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O:
- The molecule has:
  - An amide group (`CC(=O)N`) attached to an aromatic ring (increasing property).
  - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) on the same aromatic ring (decreasing property).
  - No other significant functional groups or flexible chains.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy + nitro) has a value of **0.14285714**.
  - `CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (amide + flexible chain) has a value of **0.90909091**.
  - The target molecule is likely closer to the former due to the nitro group's strong reducing effect, but the amide may slightly offset this.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is likely **~0.16666667** (similar to other nitro-aromatic compounds with one additional moderate functional group). 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.16666667**

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.4166666666666667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br)**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br) tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`, `Brc1cccc2ccccc12`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`).
   - This suggests that halogen atoms strongly reduce the property value to zero.

2. **Oxygen and Sulfur Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with oxygen or sulfur in non-halogen contexts (e.g., alcohols, ethers, thiols) often have higher property values (e.g., `CCC(C)CO` = 1.0, `CSSC` = 1.0, `CCCO` = 1.0).
   - However, if these are part of complex or aromatic systems, the value may be lower (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` = 0.625).

3. **Phosphorus and Sulfur in Non-Halogen Contexts**:
   - The given molecule contains a **P(=S)** group and a **thioether (S)** linkage. These are not directly associated with halogens, so they may not force the property to zero.

4. **Aromatic Systems with Halogens**:
   - The molecule has a **chlorinated aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc`)**, which is a strong indicator of a property value of **0.0** based on the examples (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` = 0.0, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` = 0.0).

5. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule also contains an **ester-like group (`c(=O)oc`)**, but this is unlikely to override the effect of the halogen.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the **chlorine atom on the aromatic ring** is the dominant feature, and all examples with such a feature have a property value of **0.0**. The other groups (P=S, S-alkyl, ester) do not appear to counteract this effect in the given data.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alcohols (with -OH group) and fully saturated hydrocarbons tend to have a property value of 1.0**:
   - Examples:
     - `CCCCCCC(C)O` → 1.0
     - `CCC` → 1.0
     - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` → 1.0
     - `CC(C)CO` → 1.0
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 1.0
   - These molecules are either simple alkanes or alcohols with no significant functional groups that would reduce the property value.

2. **Molecules with aromatic rings, halogens, or other functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, etc.) tend to have lower property values**:
   - Examples:
     - `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → 0.0 (aromatic + nitro)
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` → 0.0 (aromatic + halogens)
     - `CC(=O)CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O` → 0.15789474 (aromatic + carbonyl)

3. **Branching in alcohols does not necessarily reduce the property value if the molecule is still simple and saturated**:
   - Example:
     - `CC(C)CO` → 1.0 (branched alcohol, but still saturated and simple).

### Analysis of **CC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a **branched alcohol** (tert-butanol, with a -OH group attached to a tertiary carbon).
- It is fully saturated (no double bonds, aromatic rings, or other functional groups).
- Similar to `CC(C)CO` (isobutanol, property = 1.0) and other simple alcohols in the examples.

### Conclusion:
Since **CC(C)(C)CO** is a simple, saturated alcohol with no complicating functional groups, its property value is likely **1.0**, consistent with the trend observed in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles (e.g., pyridines, imidazoles, purines):**
   - Many such molecules have property values of **0.0** or low values (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` = 0.0, `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` = 0.0, `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` = 0.14285714).
   - The presence of multiple nitrogens in a fused ring system (e.g., purine-like structures) tends to result in low or zero property values.

2. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., carbonyl, hydroxyl, nitro):**
   - Molecules with polar groups (especially in aromatic systems) often have low property values (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1` = 0.0, `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` = 0.05).

3. **Non-Polar or Hydrocarbon-Like Structures:**
   - Molecules with aliphatic chains or simple rings (e.g., `CCC1CCCCC1` = 1.0, `CC(C)CCO` = 1.0) tend to have high property values (close to 1.0).

4. **Halogenated Aromatics:**
   - Many halogenated aromatics have property values of 0.0 or low values (e.g., `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 0.0, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` = 0.0).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is a **fused bicyclic heterocycle** (resembling a purine-like structure) with:
- A carbonyl group (`O=`) at position 1.
- Multiple nitrogens in the ring system (`[nH]` and `nc`).
- High polarity due to the carbonyl and NH groups.

This structure is very similar to molecules like `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (property = 0.0) and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (property = 0.0), which are also polar nitrogen-rich heterocycles with low property values.

### Prediction:
Given the strong resemblance to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles with property values of **0.0**, the predicted property for `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is:

**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols/Ethers/Esters with No Aromaticity or Complex Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(C)O (1.0)**, **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (1.0)**, **CCCOC(C)C (1.0)**, **ClCCCCl (1.0)**, **CCC(C)(C)C (1.0)**, **CC(C)O (1.0)**, **CC(O)C(C)(C)C (1.0)**, and **CCCCCCCO (1.0)** all have property values of **1.0**. These are simple, flexible, aliphatic structures with no aromatic rings or polar/charged groups.
   - The presence of halogens (e.g., **ClCCCCl**) or branching (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**) does not reduce the property value if the molecule remains aliphatic and non-aromatic.

2. **Aromatic or Conjugated Systems**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43 (0.0)**, **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (0.0)**, **NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.0)**, **Oc1ccncc1 (0.0)**, **c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O) (0.0)**) almost always have a property value of **0.0** or very low (e.g., **0.125** for **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccccc13**).

3. **Polar or Charged Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar/charged groups (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.0)**, **NS(=O)(=O)c1cc(ccc1Cl)C2(O)NC(=O)c3ccccc23 (0.07142857)**, **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 (0.0)**) tend to have low property values, especially if combined with aromaticity.

4. **Hybrid Cases (Aliphatic + Some Polar/Aromatic Features)**:
   - Molecules like **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (0.81818182)** or **CCC(C)C(=O)C (0.83333333)** have high but not perfect property values. These are aliphatic but contain carbonyl groups or slight complexity.
   - **CCCC(=O)CC (0.83333333)** is another example of an aliphatic ketone with a high but not perfect value.

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- The structure is **isopropyl formate** (an ester: **CH3-CH(OCH3)-C=O**). 
- It is aliphatic (no aromatic rings) and has a simple, flexible structure with an ester group (**OC=O**). 
- Esters are polar but not as polar as acids or amines, and the examples show that aliphatic esters can still have high property values (e.g., **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (1.0)** is a phosphate ester with **1.0**).
- The molecule is not aromatic or conjugated, and the ester group is the only polar feature.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple aliphatic molecules with no aromaticity tend to have **1.0**.
- The ester group here is not as disruptive as aromaticity or highly polar groups (e.g., amines, nitro groups).
- Similar aliphatic esters (like **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**) have **1.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **1.0**.

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) and no polar or flexible substituents tend to have low property values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = 0.0, `c1ccncc1` = 0.0).
   - Introducing polar or flexible substituents (e.g., `-OH`, `-CO-`, `-NH-`) often increases the property value (e.g., `OCC(O)CO` = 1.0, `OC1CCCCC1` = 1.0).

2. **Amide Groups (`-CONH-`)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (`-CONH-`) tend to have intermediate property values:
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 0.125 (amide with aromatic ring).
     - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = 0.75 (cyclic diamide).
     - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` = 0.3 (amide with aromatic ether).

3. **Symmetry and Flexibility**:
   - Symmetric or flexible molecules (e.g., aliphatic rings or chains) tend to have higher property values (e.g., `C1CCCCC1` = 1.0, `CCCCCO` = 1.0).
   - Rigid or highly substituted aromatic systems tend to have lower values (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = 0.0).

4. **Multiple Aromatic Rings**:
   - Fused aromatic rings (e.g., naphthalene) tend to have low values (e.g., `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` = 0.09090909).
   - Non-fused aromatic rings with flexible linkers can have higher values (e.g., `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` is similar to this case).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (urea derivative with two phenyl groups) has the following features:
- A central urea group (`-NH-CO-NH-`) linking two phenyl rings.
- The urea group is polar and flexible, but the two phenyl rings add rigidity.
- No other substituents or flexible chains are present.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (amide with aromatic ether) = 0.3.
- `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic diamide) = 0.75.
- `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` is more rigid than the cyclic diamide but less rigid than simple aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the rigidity from the two phenyl rings but the flexibility of the urea linker, the property value is likely **intermediate**. A reasonable estimate is **0.4**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is **0.4**.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.07692307692307693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) or fused aromatic systems often have property values of **0.0** or low values (e.g., 0.125, 0.14285714). Examples:
     - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl-like): **0.0**
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (polycyclic aromatic): **0.0**
     - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene): **0.0**
     - `Brc1ccccc1` (bromobenzene): **0.0**
   - Aromatic systems with small substituents (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`): **0.125**.
   - Larger or more complex aromatic systems tend to have slightly higher but still low values (e.g., `Cc3nnc4CN=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2n34`): **0.11764706**.

2. **Non-Aromatic or Aliphatic Systems**:
   - Molecules with aliphatic chains or non-aromatic rings (e.g., `CCCCCCc1ccccc1`): **0.5**.
   - Fully aliphatic or flexible chains (e.g., `CCSCC`, `CCC1CCCCC1`): **1.0**.

3. **Heteroatoms or Functional Groups**:
   - Presence of heteroatoms (O, N, S, P) or polar groups can increase the property value, but aromaticity still dominates. For example:
     - `COC(=O)C`: **0.66666667** (ester).
     - `CCOC(=O)N`: **0.66666667** (carbamate).
     - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`: **0.0** (despite thiourea, aromaticity drives it to 0).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused benzene rings. 

- It is purely aromatic with no aliphatic or polar substituents.
- Similar purely aromatic molecules in the examples (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) have property values of **0.0**.
- Even simpler aromatic systems like biphenyl (`N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) or naphthalene-like structures have **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong correlation between purely aromatic fused-ring systems and a property value of **0.0**, the predicted property value for **fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 24
SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, hydrogen-bond donor/accepting).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2 (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: An electron-donating group (polar, hydrogen-bond donor).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple polar groups (guanidine, sulfonyl, and amino) capable of hydrogen bonding, which typically reduces the property value in the given examples (e.g., highly polar or charged molecules tend to have lower values).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**) have values like **0.33333333**.
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**) have values of **0.0**.
   - The guanidine-like group is similar to **CNN** (value **1.0**), but the additional sulfonyl and aromatic NH2 groups will likely reduce the value significantly.

4. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule is not highly symmetric or fully conjugated, which might otherwise increase the value (e.g., polycyclic aromatics with no polar groups have **0.0**).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, the value is likely **low**. A reasonable estimate is **0.25**, similar to other polar aromatic molecules in the examples (e.g., **CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has **0.25**).

### Final Answer:
**0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 25
SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.38461538461538464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to identify patterns or trends.

### Given Molecule:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Structural Features:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples:
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a property value of **0.0**.
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a property value of **0.06666667**.
   - `Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl` has a property value of **0.0**.
   - `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` has a property value of **0.0**.
   Nitro groups (and other strongly electron-withdrawing groups) seem to correlate with low property values (often 0.0 or close to it).

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. From the examples:
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (contains Cl and NO2) has a property value of **0.06666667**.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a property value of **0.22222222**.
   Halogens (Cl, F) and other electron-withdrawing groups tend to reduce the property value.

3. **Tertiary Amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is a somewhat bulky and basic group. From the examples:
   - `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1` has a property value of **0.4**.
   - `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` has a property value of **0.2**.
   The presence of an amine can contribute to higher property values, but the effect is diminished when combined with strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

4. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**: The aromatic ring is heavily substituted with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, which are strongly deactivating. This likely suppresses the property value significantly.

### Comparison to Examples:
The closest analogs are molecules with nitro groups and halogens, which tend to have property values close to **0.0**. The presence of the tertiary amine might slightly increase the value, but the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups dominate.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, the property value is likely very low. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction is:

**0.06666667** (similar to `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`, which also has nitro groups and halogens). 

### Final Answer:
**0.06666667**

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols/Ethers with No Unsaturation or Functional Groups** (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CCCCCO, ClC(Cl)Cl, BrCBr, C1CCCCCCC1):
   - These molecules typically have a property value of **1.0**.
   - They are fully saturated (no double/triple bonds) and lack polar or aromatic functional groups.

2. **Molecules with Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Aliphatic Aldehydes/Ketones**: 
     - CCC=O: 0.75
     - C=CC=O: 0.83333333 (O=C1CCCCC1)
     - CC(=O)N: 0.5
     - CC(=O)C: 0.88888889 (CCCCCCCC(=O)C)
   - The presence of a carbonyl group reduces the property value, but the extent depends on the rest of the structure.

3. **Molecules with Ether Linkages (O-R)**:
   - Ethers like CCOC(=O)C or CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC tend to have high values (0.85714286 or 1.0) unless combined with other functional groups.

4. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching (e.g., CC(C)O) does not significantly reduce the property value (still 1.0 unless other functional groups are present).

### Analysis of CC(C)OC=O:
- The structure is **isopropyl formate** (an ester: R-O-C=O).
- It has:
  - A branched aliphatic chain (CC(C)-).
  - An ether linkage (O-).
  - A carbonyl group (C=O).
- Similar molecules:
  - CC(=O)OCC: 0.85714286 (ethyl acetate, similar ester).
  - CC(C)CCOC=O: 0.83333333 (branched aldehyde with ether).
- The ester group (OC=O) is slightly more polar than a simple aldehyde/ketone but less disruptive than aromatic or nitro groups.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O (0.83333333)** and **CC(=O)OCC (0.85714286)**, the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely in the same range. 

A reasonable estimate is **0.85**, but looking at the examples, the values are often fractions with simple denominators (e.g., 6/7 ≈ 0.85714286, 5/6 ≈ 0.83333333). 

The closest match is **0.85714286** (6/7).

### Final Answer:
**0.85714286**

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Branched/Aliphatic Hydrocarbons (e.g., CC(C)C, CCCC(C)(C)C, C1CCOC1, CCI, ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl, CO, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC, etc.)**:
   - These molecules tend to have property values of **1.0** or close to it (e.g., 0.777, 0.666). They are often simple, non-aromatic, or have flexible aliphatic chains.

2. **Aromatic Rings with No Substituents or Simple Substituents (e.g., c1ccc2ccccc2c1, c1ccccc1O, Clc1cccc(c1)c2ccccc2Cl)**:
   - These tend to have property values of **0.0**, especially if they are purely aromatic or have minimal substitution.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Polar or Bulky Substituents (e.g., COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1, Cc1cccc(N)c1, Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)**:
   - These tend to have **low but non-zero values** (e.g., 0.125, 0.14285714). The presence of polar groups (OH, NO2, etc.) or small alkyl groups reduces the property value but doesn't bring it to 0.

4. **Mixed Aliphatic-Aromatic Systems (e.g., C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, CCc1ccccc1C)**:
   - These have **intermediate values** (e.g., 0.14285714, 0.33333333). The property seems to scale with the "aliphatic character" of the molecule.

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (toluene derivative with an OH group and an extra methyl).
- It has:
  - An aromatic ring (reduces property value).
  - Two methyl groups (increase property value, as seen in aliphatic-aromatic hybrids like CCc1ccccc1C, which has a value of 0.333).
  - One polar OH group (reduces property value, as seen in phenolic compounds like c1ccccc1O, which has 0.0, but here the methyls counteract this).

Given that **CCc1ccccc1C** (ethylbenzene) has a value of **0.333**, and **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (xylene) would likely be similar, adding an OH group would reduce the value slightly. However, the OH is not as strongly reducing as multiple halogens or nitro groups (which often give 0.0 or very low values).

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **0.25**, balancing the aromatic + OH reduction with the methyl group contributions. This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., Cc1cccc(N)c1 has 0.14285714, and this molecule has more alkylation).

### Final Answer:
**0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphate/Thiophosphate Esters (COP(=S)(OC)...)**:
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)** group tend to have property values of **0.25** when attached to aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., halogens or alkyl groups). Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **0.25**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **0.25**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **0.25**

2. **Aromatic Substitutions**:
   - The presence of **alkyl (e.g., methyl) or thioether (SC)** groups on the aromatic ring does not significantly increase the property value beyond what is observed for halogen substitutions (which give 0.25 in phosphate esters).

3. **Key Features of the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, which has:
     - A **thiophosphate group (COP(=S)(OC))**, similar to the examples above.
     - An aromatic ring substituted with **SC (thioether)** and **C (methyl)** groups.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The **thiophosphate group** is the dominant feature, and the aromatic substitutions (SC and C) are not more polar or electron-withdrawing than halogens (which gave 0.25 in similar cases). 
- The **SC group** is somewhat analogous to halogens in terms of bulkiness but is less electron-withdrawing. This suggests the property value should not exceed 0.25.
- No examples with **SC** are given, but **methyl (C)** alone does not increase the value beyond 0.25 in similar structures.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the consistency of **0.25** for phosphate/thiophosphate esters with substituted aromatic rings, the most reasonable prediction for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is:

**0.25**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) aromatic compounds** tend to have a property value of **0.0**:
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`: 0.0
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`: 0.0
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`: 0.0
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`: 0.0
   - `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34`: 0.0 (polycyclic aromatic without halogens, but still 0.0)
   - `Sc1ccccc1`: 0.0 (simple aromatic with sulfur)
   - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 0.0 (fluorine and bromine substitution)

2. **Non-halogenated or less halogenated aliphatic/aromatic compounds** tend to have higher property values (e.g., 0.5–1.0).

3. The molecule in question, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, is a **highly chlorinated polycyclic aromatic compound**, similar to the examples with property values of 0.0. It has:
   - Two benzene rings fused together (naphthalene-like core).
   - Five chlorine substituents, making it heavily halogenated.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong trend that heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds consistently have a property value of **0.0**, the predicted property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**:
   - **CCC** (propane): 1.0
   - **CC** (ethane): 1.0
   - **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 1.0
   - **CCCCCCCCC** (nonane): 1.0
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 1.0
   - **CC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.5
   - **CC(=C)C=C** (diene): 0.2
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): 0.0

   Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes) tend to have a property value of **1.0**, while unsaturation (double bonds) reduces the value.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): 0.0 (no nitro, but nitriles)
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): 0.0
     - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: 0.538 (nitro groups with other substituents)
     - **Nc1ccccc1O** (aminophenol): 0.0 (no nitro)
     - **CCCN(=O)=O**: This is a nitroalkane (similar to the trinitro case but simpler).

   Nitro groups tend to reduce the property value, often to **0.0** if they are the dominant feature (e.g., trinitrobenzene). However, in some cases with other balancing features (e.g., alkyl chains), the value is higher (e.g., 0.538).

   - **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
     - **CC(=O)C**: 0.5 (ketone)
     - **CCCCCC=O** (aldehyde): 0.833
     - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1=O** (cyclic ketone): 0.9
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C**: 0.5 (imide)

   Carbonyls reduce the value but not as drastically as nitro groups.

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The given molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** is a nitropropane. From the examples:
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): 0.0
     - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: 0.538 (but this has additional complexity)
     - Simpler nitroalkanes are not directly represented, but nitro groups heavily reduce the value.

   Given that nitro groups are strongly deactivating (as seen in the trinitrobenzene example), and the molecule is a simple nitroalkane, the property value is likely **low**.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: 0.538 (but this has two nitro groups and other substituents)
   - **CCCN(=O)=O** is simpler, so the value should be lower. Likely closer to **0.0** (like trinitrobenzene) or slightly higher due to the alkyl chain.

### Prediction:
Given the strong reducing effect of the nitro group and the simplicity of the molecule (no other functional groups to offset the nitro), the property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is likely **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple halogenated benzenes** (e.g., Cl or Br substitution) tend to have a property value of **0.0**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` → 0.0  
   - `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` → 0.0  
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` → 0.0  
   - `c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12` → 0.0  

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups** (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -COO, -N, etc.) often have non-zero values, but simple halogen substitutions (F, Cl, Br) on benzene rings consistently yield **0.0** unless combined with other functional groups.

3. The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a **dihalogenated benzene** (fluorine and bromine substituents), structurally similar to the examples above that have a property value of **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
Since **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a simple halogenated benzene with no additional functional groups, its property value is likely **0.0**, consistent with the observed trend in the given examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains with Terminal Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -Br):**
   - Molecules like `CBr`, `CCCCBr`, `CCCC(C)(C)O`, `CC(C)(C)CO`, `CCCOCCC`, and `CCCCCCCC(C)O` all have a property value of **1.0**. These are typically saturated hydrocarbons with a single terminal functional group (halogen or alcohol).

2. **Cyclic Structures with Oxygen or Nitrogen:**
   - Molecules with rings (especially those with oxygen or nitrogen) tend to have lower property values unless they are simple saturated rings like `CC1CCCO1` (property = 1.0).
   - For example, `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` has a property of **0.5**, while more complex or aromatic systems have even lower values.

3. **Presence of Multiple Functional Groups or Unsaturation:**
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, halogens) or unsaturation (double bonds, aromaticity) tend to have property values < 1.0.
   - For example, `CC(=O)C` has a lower value than `CCOC(=O)C` (0.75), and aromatic systems often have very low or zero values.

4. **Steroids or Polycyclic Systems:**
   - Steroid-like molecules (e.g., `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO`) have intermediate values (~0.75).
   - Simpler polycyclic systems without polar groups may have higher values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**
1. **Structure:**
   - This is a bicyclic system (two fused rings) with:
     - A tertiary alcohol (`C(O)`).
     - No unsaturation (all single bonds).
     - No aromaticity or highly polar groups beyond the -OH.
   - The structure is similar to decalin (bicyclo[4.4.0]decane) with an -OH group.

2. **Comparison to Examples:**
   - The molecule is simpler than the steroids in the examples but more complex than simple monocyclic alcohols like `CC1CCCO1` (property = 1.0).
   - The presence of the -OH group suggests some polarity, but the lack of other functional groups or unsaturation suggests a higher property value.
   - Similar molecules like `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2` (property = 0.2857) are more complex and have lower values, but this is not directly comparable.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Given the lack of unsaturation or additional functional groups, the property value is likely high but not 1.0 (due to the -OH group and bicyclic structure).
   - A reasonable estimate is **0.8**, similar to `CC(C)COC=O` (property = 0.8), which also has a single polar group and moderate complexity.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is **0.8**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.3333333333333333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to identify patterns.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a property value of **0.42857143**. This molecule contains a `P(=S)` group attached to ethoxy (`OCC`) groups and a thiol (`SC`) linker to another fragment.
   - The molecule we are predicting, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, also has a `P(=S)` group attached to ethoxy groups but links to a lactam (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) instead of a thiol.

2. **Lactam (Cyclic Amide) Groups**:
   - Molecules with cyclic amides (e.g., `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2`) tend to have moderate property values (e.g., **0.66666667**).
   - The lactam in the target molecule is aromatic (`c1ccccc1`), which may slightly reduce the property value compared to aliphatic lactams.

3. **Ethoxy (OCC) Groups**:
   - Ethoxy groups alone (e.g., `COC(=O)C`) contribute to higher values (e.g., **0.66666667**), but when combined with other features, the value may decrease.

4. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromatic rings alone (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`) tend to give **0.0**, but when combined with polar or functional groups, the value increases.

### Structural Comparison:
- The target molecule has:
  - A `P(=S)(OCC)2` core (similar to the example with **0.42857143** but without the `SC` linker).
  - A lactam (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) attached to the phosphorus, which is less polarizable than the `SC(CCl)` group in the example.
  - No highly polar or charged groups that would significantly increase the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (value = **0.42857143**) but with a less polarizable lactam replacing the `SC(CCl)` group, the property value should be slightly lower. 

A reasonable estimate is **0.4**.

### Final Answer:
**0.4**

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.18181818181818182
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aliphatic chains or rings (no heteroatoms or functional groups)** tend to have a property value of **1.0**:
   - CCCCOC (1.0)
   - CCCI (1.0)
   - CC(C)CC(C)(C)C (1.0)
   - C1CCCCCC1 (1.0)

2. **Aromatic systems with heteroatoms (N, O, S) or polar groups** tend to **lower the property value**:
   - Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (0.125) – contains N and O in aromatic rings.
   - CNc1ccccc1 (0.14285714) – aromatic N.
   - O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.72727273) – multiple polar groups.

3. **Molecules with carbonyl (C=O) groups in aromatic systems** often have **low values**:
   - O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.0) – two aromatic rings with C=O.
   - Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C (similar to this case).

4. **Halogenated aromatic systems** often have **0.0**:
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.0).

5. **Molecules with fused aromatic systems and heteroatoms** tend to have **low values**:
   - C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54 (0.1) – fused aromatic.
   - c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32 (0.0) – fused aromatic with N.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**:
- It has a **fused aromatic system** with two nitrogen atoms (n1 and n3).
- It contains a **carbonyl group (C=O)** in the aromatic ring.
- It is structurally similar to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 0.125), which also has a fused aromatic system with N and C=O.

Given the presence of:
- Fused aromatic rings,
- Nitrogen heteroatoms,
- A carbonyl group,

the property value is likely **low**, similar to other such molecules in the examples (e.g., 0.125 or 0.07692308). 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is **0.125**. 

This aligns with the observed trend for fused aromatic systems with N and C=O groups in the training examples.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.875
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophilic Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) or other highly polar groups (e.g., **-COO⁻**, **-NH₂**, **-PO₄**) tend to have property values close to **1.0** (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)CO**, **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**).
   - These groups increase solubility in water or polar environments, which seems to correlate with higher property values.

2. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes or largely non-polar molecules (e.g., **CCCCC**, **CCC(C)C(C)O**) also tend to have property values of **1.0**, suggesting that pure hydrophobicity may also contribute to higher values.
   - Branched alkanes or chains with minimal polarity often score **1.0**.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens or Low Polarity**: 
   - Aromatic compounds with halogens (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1I**, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**) typically have property values of **0.0**, indicating that heavy halogenation or lack of polar groups reduces the property value.
   - Aromatic systems without polar groups also score low (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)cnc3ccccc23**).

4. **Mixed Polarity (Polar + Non-Polar)**:
   - Molecules with both polar and non-polar regions (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCCCC1)C(=O)N2**) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.8**, **0.727**).
   - The balance between polar and non-polar features seems to scale the property value between 0 and 1.

5. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**) often have high values (e.g., **0.9**), especially if the non-polar chain is dominant.
   - Carbonyls (e.g., **O=C1CCC(=O)N1**) may have intermediate values (e.g., **0.5**).

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This molecule is **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate). 
- It has:
  - A long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCC-**) contributing to hydrophobicity.
  - An ester group (**-C(=O)OCC**), which is polar but not as strongly hydrophilic as a free carboxylate or hydroxyl group.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonyl acetate) has a property value of **0.9**.
  - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ester) has **0.809**.
  - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has **0.8**.

Given that **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a simpler ester with a moderately long aliphatic chain, its property value should be close to these ester examples. The chain is shorter than nonyl acetate, so the value might be slightly lower than **0.9** but higher than **0.8**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.85** (interpolating between the examples of similar esters). 

However, looking at the exact examples:
- **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (9-carbon ester): **0.9**
- **CC(=O)OC...** (complex ester): **0.809**
- **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (small ester): **0.8**

Since **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a 6-carbon ester, it is between the small and large esters. A reasonable estimate is **0.85**, but the closest exact match in the examples is **0.9** for the longer ester. Given the trend, I would predict:

**Final Prediction: 0.9** (consistent with the trend for aliphatic esters).
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.125
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular flexibility and the presence of polar or charged functional groups. The property tends to be **1.0** for simple, flexible aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `CCC(C)(C)O`, `CC(Cl)CCl`) and **0.0** for rigid or highly polar/charged structures (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2`, `NC(=O)c1cnccn1`). Intermediate values arise for molecules with partial flexibility or moderate polarity.

The molecule in question, **`COC(=O)c1ccccc1` (methyl benzoate)**, has:
1. A rigid aromatic ring.
2. A polar ester group (`COC=O`), but no strong charges or additional rigidifying features.

Comparing to similar examples:
- `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) has a property of **0.22222222**.
- `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC` (a diester) has **0.6**, but this is more flexible due to the long chain.
- `COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1` (a more complex ester) has **0.125**.

Given that methyl benzoate is slightly less flexible than ethyl benzoate (due to the shorter ester chain) but otherwise similar, its property should be **close to 0.22222222**, likely slightly lower.

### Predicted property value: **0.2** (rounded from ~0.222, considering the shorter chain reduces flexibility slightly). 

This aligns with the trend where simple aromatic esters without extended aliphatic chains fall in the **0.1–0.3** range.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.2
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), we can deduce the following patterns for the property:

1. **Fully saturated hydrocarbons** (e.g., **C1CCCC1**, **CCC(C)(C)CC**, **CCC(O)C(C)C**) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic systems** (e.g., **C=Cc1ccccc1**, **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
3. **Simple alkenes with isolated double bonds** (e.g., **CC/C=C/C**) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.6**), but **conjugated systems** (like 1,3-butadiene) often behave similarly to aromatic systems in many properties due to delocalization.

Given that **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene (similar in electronic structure to aromatic systems in terms of π-electron delocalization), it aligns with the trend where such systems have a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted property value for **C=CCC=C**: **0.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Fully halogenated or highly symmetric molecules** (e.g., **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) tend to have property values of **1.0** or **0.0**, depending on their structure.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a fully halogenated, symmetric molecule) has a property value of **1.0**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a fully halogenated, symmetric molecule) has a property value of **0.0**.
   - The presence of multiple halogens (Cl, Br, F) seems to influence the property, but symmetry and saturation also play a role.

2. **Simple, fully saturated hydrocarbons** (e.g., **C1CCCCC1**, **CC(C)CO**, **CCCC(C)C**) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.

3. **Molecules with aromatic rings or unsaturation** often have lower property values (e.g., **c2ccc1NCCc1c2** has **0.25**, **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has **0.0**).

4. **Molecules with a central carbon fully substituted by halogens** (e.g., **C(Br)(Br)Br**) are analogous to **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** in the first example, which has a property value of **1.0**.

### Analysis of **BrC(Br)Br**:
- The molecule is **bromotribromomethane (C(Br)₃)**, a fully halogenated, symmetric molecule with a central carbon atom bonded to three bromine atoms.
- This is structurally similar to **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (from the first example, which has a property value of **1.0**) and **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (which also has a property value of **1.0**).
- There are no aromatic rings or unsaturation, and the molecule is fully saturated with halogens.

### Conclusion:
Given the pattern, **BrC(Br)Br** is predicted to have a property value of **1.0**.

**Predicted property value: 1.0**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.42857142857142855
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple, symmetric, or highly halogenated molecules** (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, `Brc1cccc(Br)c1`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
2. **Highly flexible aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
3. **Molecules with moderate complexity and some polar/functional groups** (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`, `CCCCC#C`) have intermediate values (e.g., ~0.666).
4. **Molecules with a mix of aromatic rings, polar groups, and some flexibility** (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) have values around **0.4–0.5**.
5. **Molecules with rigid, fused aromatic systems or heavy halogenation** tend to have **0.0**.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` has:
- A **phosphate-like core** (`P(=S)(OCC)OCC`) with two ethoxy groups and a thiol linkage.
- A **chloroalkyl group** (`SC(CCl)`).
- A **fused aromatic-lactam system** (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`), which is rigid and polar.

### Comparison to Examples:
1. The phosphate/thiol part resembles `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **0.46153846**), which has a similar P=S group and flexible side chains.
2. The fused aromatic-lactam system adds rigidity, similar to some of the lower-scoring aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` = 0.0), but the presence of flexible side chains mitigates this.
3. The overall structure is less flexible than aliphatic chains (which score 1.0) but more complex than simple halogenated aromatics (which score 0.0).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between flexibility (from the ethoxy and thiol groups) and rigidity (from the aromatic-lactam system), the property value is likely **intermediate**, similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` but slightly lower due to the additional rigidity of the lactam. 

**Predicted property value: 0.4** (approximately, e.g., 0.4 to 0.45). 

For precision, based on the closest example (`COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 0.46153846), we can estimate **~0.42**.

### Final Answer:
**0.42** (approximate, likely in the range 0.4–0.45).

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (1.0 or close):**
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC`, `ClCCCCl`, `CCCCCCBr`).
   - Halogenated aliphatic compounds (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).
   - No aromatic rings or polar functional groups that significantly reduce the property.

2. **Low Property Values (0.0 or close):**
   - Aromatic systems, especially with multiple rings (e.g., `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`, `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`).
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) on aromatic rings (e.g., `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Thioamides or thioureas (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`).

3. **Intermediate Values:**
   - Molecules with mixed aliphatic and aromatic features or polar groups (e.g., `CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` → 0.21052632).
   - Amides or carbamates (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)C` → 0.75, `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` → 0.8).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** has the following features:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: A chlorinated phenyl ring (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`).
2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Tertiary amide (`CN(C)C(=O)N`).
   - Chlorine substituent on the aromatic ring.
   - Heterocyclic group (`n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C`) with an oxo (=O) group.
3. **Bulky Aliphatic Groups**: The `C(C)(C)C` (tert-butyl) group adds some aliphatic character.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of an aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent and polar groups (amide, heterocycle) suggests the property will not be high (not close to 1.0).
- The tertiary amide (`CN(C)C(=O)N`) is similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = 0.8), but the aromatic and heterocyclic components will reduce the value.
- The closest analog is `CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.21052632), which has aromatic rings and polar amide/imide groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the mixed aliphatic/aromatic nature and polar functional groups, the property value is likely in the **0.2 to 0.3 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds (Cl, Br, etc.)**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogen substitutions (especially Cl) on aromatic rings tend to have **property = 0.0**:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → 0.0
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → 0.0
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → 0.0
     - `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1` → 0.0
     - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → 0.0
   - The presence of halogens (Cl) on aromatic rings seems to strongly correlate with a property value of 0.0.

2. **Hydroxyl Groups (OH)**:
   - Hydroxyl groups alone do not necessarily override the effect of halogens. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → 0.0 (despite having OH groups).
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → 0.0 (multiple OH and Cl groups).

3. **Structure of the Given Molecule**:
   - The molecule is a **dichlorinated biphenyl derivative with two hydroxyl groups**:
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`
     - It has three Cl atoms and two OH groups attached to aromatic rings.
     - This is structurally similar to the examples above where halogenated aromatics (especially with Cl) have property = 0.0.

### Prediction:
Given the strong trend that **aromatic molecules with multiple Cl substitutions consistently have a property value of 0.0**, even in the presence of OH groups, the predicted property for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:

**Predicted Property: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.6
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples, the property seems to correlate with molecular symmetry, flexibility, and the presence of certain functional groups or halogens. Here are some observations:

1. **Highly symmetric or fully saturated hydrocarbons** (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `CCSCC`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Molecules with double bonds or rings but still flexible/symmetric** (e.g., `CC/C=C/C` with a value of **0.6**, `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` with **0.4**) have intermediate values.
3. **Aromatic systems or polar functional groups** (e.g., `O=Cc1ccccc1`, `c1ccccc1O`) tend to have a value of **0.0** unless balanced by symmetry or saturation.
4. **Molecules with halogens or branching** can vary but often trend toward lower values unless fully substituted (e.g., `ClC(Cl)Cl` is **1.0**, but `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` is **0.0**).

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C` (trans-2-pentene), which is structurally similar to `CC/C=C/C` (likely cis-2-butene, with a value of **0.6**). Both are alkenes with moderate symmetry and flexibility. 

Given the similarity, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is likely close to **0.6**. 

However, since trans-alkenes are slightly more symmetric than cis-alkenes, the value might be slightly higher. But in the examples, `CC/C=C/C` (less symmetric) is **0.6**, and `CCCC(=O)OC` (more flexible/less symmetric) is **0.8**, so **0.6** seems reasonable.

**Final prediction: 0.6**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes and alcohols** (e.g., C, CC(C)O, CC(C)Cl, CCC(O)CC, C1CCCCCC1) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
   - These are saturated hydrocarbons or simple derivatives with no significant electronegative or polar features beyond single bonds or simple functional groups (like -OH or -Cl).
   - Example: `C` (methane) = 1.0, `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) = 1.0, `CC(C)Cl` = 1.0.

2. **Ethers** (e.g., CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2) have intermediate values, but this example is complex. Simpler ethers like **CCOCC** (diethyl ether) are not explicitly listed, but structurally similar to alkanes.

3. **Molecules with double/triple bonds or aromaticity** tend to have lower values (e.g., `CC#C` = 0.333, `Cc1cccc(C)c1` = 0.25).

4. **Highly halogenated or polar/charged groups** (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = 0.0, `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = 0.0) tend to reduce the property to 0 or near 0.

5. **CCCOCC** is a simple ether with no unsaturation, halogens, or aromaticity. It is structurally similar to alkanes (like `CCC(O)CC` = 1.0) but with an oxygen bridge. Since the oxygen in ethers is less disruptive than halogens or unsaturation, and given the trend for saturated systems, it is likely close to 1.0.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCOCC** is a saturated ether with no complicating features (like halogens, unsaturation, or aromaticity), and similar saturated molecules (e.g., `CCC(O)CC`) have a value of 1.0, the predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is:

**1.0**

1. **Functional Groups and Features**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar but not highly hydrophilic.
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are hydrophobic.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to one of the phenyl rings adds significant hydrophobicity.
   - No highly polar or ionizable groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-COOH`, `-NH2`, `-SO3H`, or `-NO2`) are present.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with **hydrophobic groups (e.g., long aliphatic chains, phenyl rings)** and **no polar/ionizable groups** tend to have property values close to **1.0** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCO`, `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`, `CCCCCC`).
   - Molecules with **polar/ionizable groups** (e.g., `-NO2`, `-SO3H`, halogens, multiple `-OH`) tend to have property values close to **0.0** (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
   - The presence of **amide groups** in some examples (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` with property value **0.125**) suggests that amides can reduce the property value, but this example also has additional polar heterocycles.
   - The molecule **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two phenyl rings with an aliphatic linker) has a property value of **0.14285714**, but our molecule has additional hydrophobic bulk (tert-butyl) and no polar groups beyond the amide.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The **tert-butyl group and two phenyl rings** dominate the hydrophobicity.
   - The **amide group** is the only polar feature, but it is tertiary and not strongly hydrophilic.
   - No other polar/ionizable groups are present to pull the value toward 0.0.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong hydrophobicity and lack of polar/ionizable groups (beyond the weakly polar amide), the property value is likely close to **1.0**, but slightly reduced due to the amide. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` (hydrophobic with an amide) has a value of **0.92307692**.
- `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two phenyl rings) has a value of **0.14285714**, but our molecule is more hydrophobic due to the tert-butyl group.

Thus, a reasonable prediction is **~0.9**, similar to the example with the hydrophobic structure and amide.

### Final Answer:
**0.92307692** (matching the closest analogous example).

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Br, Cl, F):**
   - Molecules with halogens (especially aromatic halogens) tend to have property values of **0.0** or very low values.
   - Examples:
     - `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`: 0.0
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 0.0
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`: 0.0
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 0.0

2. **Amide Groups (-NHC=O):**
   - Molecules with amide groups (like `CC(=O)N-`) often have intermediate property values, but the presence of halogens can suppress this.
   - Example:
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: 0.235 (amide with no halogen)
     - `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1`: 0.625 (amide-like with Cl, but not directly comparable)

3. **Aromatic Systems with Substituents:**
   - Simple aromatic systems with halogens or polar groups often have low or zero values.
   - Example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`: 0.0 (nitro group)
     - `ClCc1ccccc1`: 0.14285714 (chlorobenzene derivative)

4. **Combination of Amide and Halogen:**
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has both an amide group (`CC(=O)N-`) and a bromine substituent on the aromatic ring. From the examples, this combination is likely to result in a low property value, possibly **0.0** or close to it.

### Prediction:
Given the strong trend that aromatic bromine substituents lead to a property value of **0.0** and the amide group does not seem to counteract this effect significantly in the examples, the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains with OH or O Groups**: 
   - Molecules like `CC(C)CO`, `CCCCC(O)CC`, `CC1CCCCC1`, `CC(C)CCO`, and `OC1CCCCC1` have property values of **1.0**. These are typically branched or linear aliphatic chains with hydroxyl or ether groups.
   
2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Aliphatic Substituents**:
   - `Cc1ccccc1N` has a property value of **~0.1429**.
   - `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` has a value of **~0.3333**.
   - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` has a value of **0.4**.
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` and `N#Cc1ccccc1` have values of **0.0**.
   - `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (naphthalene derivative) has a value of **~0.0909**.

3. **Branched Aliphatic Groups Attached to Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (isopropylbenzene with a methyl substituent) has a value of **0.4**.
   - The molecule `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (ethylbenzene with a methyl substituent) has a value of **~0.3333**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**
- This is **isobutylbenzene**, where an isobutyl group (`CC(C)C-`) is attached to a benzene ring.
- Compared to the examples:
  - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (isopropylbenzene with a methyl substituent) has a value of **0.4**.
  - `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (ethylbenzene with a methyl substituent) has a value of **~0.3333**.
  - The isobutyl group is slightly more aliphatic (longer chain) than isopropyl or ethyl, but it is still a simple hydrocarbon substituent on a benzene ring.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The presence of an aromatic ring tends to reduce the property value compared to purely aliphatic molecules (which often have values of 1.0).
- Longer/branched aliphatic chains attached to the ring (like isobutyl) seem to slightly increase the value compared to shorter chains (e.g., ethyl or methyl).
- The value for `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` is **0.4**, and `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` is **~0.3333**, so isobutylbenzene might have a value slightly higher than 0.4 but not as high as 0.5.

A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **~0.4286** (or **3/7**, a simple fraction close to the observed trend). However, looking at the examples, the closest match is likely **0.4**, as the isobutyl group is not significantly more "aliphatic" than isopropyl in this context.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **0.4**.
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): 0.0
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): 0.0
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): 0.0
   - **c1cncnc1** (heteroaromatic): 0.0
   - **Fc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O** (fluorinated heterocycle): 0.0
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (iodo + cyano phenol): 0.0
   - These suggest that aromatic rings with strongly polar or hydrogen-bonding substituents (e.g., NO₂, OH, NH, C=O) tend to have **property values of 0.0**.

2. **Aromatic rings with non-polar or weakly polar substituents**:
   - **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): 0.16666667
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): 0.14285714
   - **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O** (methyl + nitro + phenol): 0.14285714
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): 0.09090909
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (amide + dimethylamino): 0.22222222
   - These suggest that weakly polar substituents (e.g., CH₃, OCH₃) or mixed polar/non-polar groups lead to **low but non-zero property values**.

3. **Aliphatic or flexible chains**:
   - **ClCCCCl**: 1.0
   - **CC(C)(C)CO**: 1.0
   - **CCO**: 1.0
   - **CCCCI**: 1.0
   - **CCCC#C**: 0.6
   - These suggest that **fully aliphatic or flexible molecules tend to have high property values (1.0 or close)**.

4. **Aldehyde-containing molecules**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (unsaturated ketone): 0.5
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 0.80952381
   - **CC(=O)CCC**: 0.85714286
   - These suggest that **carbonyl (C=O) groups in non-aromatic contexts can lead to higher property values**, but in aromatic contexts (like benzaldehyde), the behavior may differ.

### Analysis of **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde):
- Benzaldehyde has an **aromatic ring + aldehyde (C=O) group**.
- From the examples, aromatic rings with polar substituents (especially C=O, NO₂, OH) tend to have **property values of 0.0**.
- The aldehyde group is strongly polar and likely dominates the property, similar to other polar aromatic systems (e.g., nitrobenzene, phenol, etc.).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong polar nature of the aldehyde group in an aromatic system, the property value is likely **0.0**, consistent with other polar aromatic molecules in the examples.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (especially those with nitro groups, halogens, or fused aromatic systems) often have a property value of 0.0. 
   - Examples: 
     - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (nitro and halogen-substituted aromatics).
     - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` (fused aromatic systems).
     - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (thiourea attached to an aromatic ring).

2. **Property = 1.0**: 
   - Simple aliphatic compounds (e.g., alcohols, ethers, halides with no aromaticity) tend to have a property value of 1.0.
   - Examples: 
     - `CCO` (ethanol), `ClC(Br)Br` (halogenated aliphatic), `CC(C)C` (branched alkane).

3. **Intermediate Values (0.0 < x < 1.0)**:
   - Molecules with mixed features (e.g., aromatic + aliphatic, polar groups, or heterocycles) often have fractional values.
   - Examples:
     - `c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)` (complex polycyclic with polar groups) → 0.357.
     - `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23` (sugar + heterocycle) → 0.5.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is:
```
O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2
```
- **Structure**:
  - Contains a **fused heterocyclic system** (imidazolidine-2,4-dione core: `O=C2CN(N=...)C(=O)N2`).
  - Attached to an **aromatic ring** (`c1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O`) with a **nitro group** (strongly electron-withdrawing).
  - The nitro group and aromaticity are dominant features, similar to many examples with property = 0.0.

- **Comparison to Examples**:
  - The molecule resembles `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (property = 0.0), which also has a nitro-substituted aromatic system.
  - The imidazolidine-2,4-dione core is polar but not aliphatic enough to outweigh the aromatic/nitro influence.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong aromatic/nitro character and similarity to other molecules with property = 0.0, the predicted property value is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with No Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules like `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43` (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3` (biphenyl-like structures) have a property value of **0.0**. These are purely aromatic with no polar or functional groups.
   - Similarly, `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) also has a property value of **0.0**.

2. **Nitrogen-Linked Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is structurally similar to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, but with a single nitrogen linker instead of a diazo group (`N=N`). 
   - The presence of the `N-N` linker does not introduce significant polarity or functionalization that would increase the property value, as seen in other examples where such linkers (like `N=N`) result in **0.0**.

3. **Other Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has a property value of **0.0**.
   - `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (carbazole-like structure) also has a property value of **0.0**.

### Conclusion:
The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is a diphenylamine derivative with two phenyl rings linked by an `N-N` group. It lacks polar or functional groups that would increase the property value (as seen in other examples where such groups are absent). Thus, it is most similar to the examples with a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.625
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to two carbonyl groups.

2. **Similarity to Examples**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.75): This is also a cyclic diamide (hydantoin derivative) with a 5-membered ring and two carbonyls. The property is relatively high (0.75).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.72727273): Another cyclic diamide with additional alkyl substitutions. The property is also high (~0.73).
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.75): A simpler lactam (cyclic amide) with a 5-membered ring. The property is 0.75.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Cyclic amides/diamides (especially 5-membered rings) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 0.7–0.75).
   - The lack of polar or bulky substituents (like nitro groups or halogens) suggests the property is not suppressed.
   - The symmetry and compactness of the structure (no long alkyl chains or aromatic systems) align with higher values.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to cyclic diamides with property values around **0.7–0.75**, and the absence of features that would lower the value (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, or extended conjugation), the most reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75**  

This matches closely with the examples of **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.727)** and **O=C1CCCN1 (0.75)**. The small structural variations (e.g., cyclopentane vs. pyrrolidine) do not significantly alter the trend. 

Thus, the predicted value is **0.75**.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, F, Br, I) aromatic systems** tend to have **low property values (often 0.0)** unless other functional groups are present. Examples:
   - `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2` → 0.0  
   - `Clc1ccccc1Cl` → 0.0  
   - `Ic1ccccc1` → 0.0  
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → 0.14285714 (slightly higher due to more Cl substituents).  

2. **Non-aromatic halogenated alkanes** tend to have **high property values (1.0 or close)**, e.g.:
   - `CC(Cl)CCl` → 1.0  
   - `ClCC(C)C` → 1.0  
   - `ClC(Br)Br` → 1.0  

3. The property seems to **decrease with aromaticity and increase with aliphatic/alkyl character**.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)**-like structure with:
- Two aromatic rings connected by a single bond.  
- Three chlorine substituents (two on one ring, one on the other).  

From the examples:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (a similar polychlorinated aromatic) has a property value of **0.14285714**.  
- Simpler di/tri-chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl`) have **0.0**.  

Since the target molecule is purely aromatic and heavily chlorinated (similar to the above cases), the property value is likely **very low**.  

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0** (consistent with other polychlorinated aromatic systems in the examples).  

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkylbenzenes**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = 0.5
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine): Property = 0.14285714
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): Property = 0.0
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): Property = 0.28571429

   These examples suggest that simple alkyl-substituted benzenes (without polar or functional groups) tend to have property values around **0.5** (e.g., hexylbenzene). The presence of polar groups (e.g., aldehyde, amine) reduces the value.

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a simple dialkyl-substituted benzene with no polar or functional groups, similar to hexylbenzene but with two ethyl groups instead of one hexyl group.
   - The symmetry and lack of polar groups suggest it should behave similarly to hexylbenzene.

3. **Other Symmetric/Alkyl-Substituted Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): Property = 1.0 (symmetric, small molecule)
   - **CCCCOC** (butyl methyl ether): Property = 1.0 (simple ether)
   - **CCCC(=O)OC** (methyl butyrate): Property = 0.8 (ester, less symmetric)
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate): Property = 0.875 (ester, longer chain)

   Symmetric or simple alkyl-substituted molecules tend to have higher property values (closer to 1.0), while polar or asymmetric groups reduce the value.

### Prediction for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**:
- This is a symmetric dialkylbenzene with no polar groups, similar to hexylbenzene (property = 0.5). The symmetry might slightly increase the value compared to hexylbenzene, but the examples don't show a strong trend for symmetry alone increasing the value significantly.
- The closest analog is hexylbenzene (0.5), so I predict a similar value.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is **0.5**.

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with:
   - An amino group (**NH2**) at position 1.
   - A sulfonamide group (**S(N)(=O)=O**) at position 4 (para to the amino group).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule has polar groups (**NH2** and **SO2NH2**) that can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - It lacks long alkyl chains or highly hydrophobic regions.
   - The sulfonamide group is electron-withdrawing, while the amino group is electron-donating.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: This is a nitro-substituted aniline (property = 0.0). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, and the molecule is polar but has a property of 0.0.
- **Oc1ccncc1**: A polar heterocycle with an OH group (property = 0.0).
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**: A polar purine-like structure (property = 0.0).
- **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1**: An amide-substituted benzene with iodine (property = 0.0).

These examples suggest that polar aromatic molecules with hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., **NH2**, **OH**, **NO2**) tend to have property values of **0.0**, especially when they lack significant hydrophobic regions.

### Prediction for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O:
- The sulfonamide group is polar and hydrogen-bonding, similar to nitro or amide groups in the examples above.
- The molecule is aromatic and lacks hydrophobic alkyl chains or large nonpolar regions.
- Given the similarity to other polar aromatic molecules with property = 0.0, the most reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the pattern governing the property values.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with the following structure:
- It has four fused benzene rings arranged in a non-linear, angular fashion (phenanthrene-like core with an additional fused ring).
- The SMILES notation `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` describes a structure where:
  - Ring 1: `c1ccc...` (benzene ring)
  - Ring 2: fused to Ring 1 (`c2...`)
  - Ring 3: fused to Ring 2 (`c3...`)
  - Ring 4: fused to Ring 3 (`c4...`), closing back to Ring 2.

This is a **tetracyclic aromatic system** resembling a combination of phenanthrene and another fused ring (e.g., chrysene-like but not fully linear).

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Fully saturated aliphatic chains or rings** (e.g., `C1CCCC1`, `CCCCBr`, `CCCOCC`) have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Simple aromatic rings with no halogens or heteroatoms** (e.g., `COc1ccccc1`, `Cc1ccc(O)cc1`) have values around **0.14285714**.
3. **Halogenated aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`) have a value of **0.0**.
4. **Fused polycyclic aromatic systems**:
   - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` has a value of **0.05263158**.
   - `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` has a value of **0.06666667**.
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` has a value of **0.0**.
   - `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` (thianaphthene) has a value of **0.0**.

### Key Pattern:
- The property appears to correlate with **molecular complexity and symmetry**:
  - Saturated/aliphatic structures (high flexibility, no conjugation) → **1.0**.
  - Simple aromatics → intermediate values (~0.1–0.2).
  - Fused polycyclic aromatics → very low values (~0.0–0.07), especially if they are highly conjugated or symmetric.
  - Halogenation or heteroatoms in fused systems tend to push the value to **0.0**.

### Prediction for `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`:
- This is a **fully conjugated, symmetric, fused aromatic system** with no heteroatoms or halogens. It resembles the examples `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (value = 0.0) and `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (value = 0.05263158), but is more symmetric and fully conjugated.
- The property likely decreases with increasing conjugation and symmetry in fused aromatics, approaching **0.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.0** (consistent with other fused, symmetric, fully aromatic systems in the examples).

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.13333333333333333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), an ether linkage (-O-), and a carbonyl group (C=O). These polar groups suggest some degree of polarity or hydrogen-bonding capability.
2. **Aromaticity**: The molecule has two aromatic rings (one fused with a non-aromatic ring containing the carbonyl group). Aromatic systems are present in many of the examples, but their impact on the property seems secondary to functional groups.
3. **Symmetry/Substitution**: The molecule is highly substituted with hydroxyl groups, which is reminiscent of polyphenolic or flavonoid-like structures. In the examples, heavily hydroxylated or polar molecules tend to have lower property values (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** with 0.058, **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** with 0.05).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (especially -OH) and no halogens or simple alkyl chains tend to have property values in the **0.0 to 0.3** range.
- The presence of **three or more -OH groups** in the given molecule is notable. For instance:
  - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (two -OH groups) has a value of **0.0**.
  - **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (five -OH groups) is an exception with **1.0**, but this is likely due to its sugar-like aliphatic structure.
  - **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (two -OH groups and complex structure) has **0.05**.
- The given molecule has **four -OH groups** and a fused ring system, which suggests even lower polarity-dominated behavior.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule's property value is likely **low**, similar to other polyhydroxylated aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate is **0.05**, matching the trend observed for such structures in the examples.

**Final Answer: 0.05**

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alcohols/Ethers**: 
   - Molecules like `CCCCC` (pentane), `CCC(O)CC` (3-pentanol), and `C1CCOC1` (tetrahydrofuran) have a property value of **1.0**. These are simple, non-polar, or slightly polar molecules without heavy heteroatoms or complex functional groups.

2. **Halogenated or Nitro Groups**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or multiple halogens (e.g., `Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) tend to have **low property values (0.14285714)**.
   - Highly halogenated molecules (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Phosphorus-Containing Compounds**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **0.25**.
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **0.2**.
   - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has a high value of **0.92857143**, likely due to the less polarizable sulfur and alkyl chains.

4. **Amides and Esters**:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **0.125**.
   - `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has a value of **0.125**.

5. **Sulfur-Containing Compounds**:
   - `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` has a value of **0.0**.
   - `c2ccc1scnc1c2` has a value of **0.0**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- The molecule contains:
  - A **phosphate group** (`P(=O)`), which is polar and often reduces the property value.
  - An **amide linkage** (`NC(C)=O`), which is polar and tends to lower the value.
  - A **thioether (S-C)** group, which is less polar than oxygen ethers but still polarizable.
  - No halogens or nitro groups, but the phosphate and amide are significant polar features.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analogs are the phosphorus-containing compounds:
  - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.25) has a thiophosphate and aromatic chlorides.
  - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.2) has a phosphate and aromatic chlorides.
  - The target molecule lacks aromatic chlorides but has an amide and thioether, which are less polarizing than chlorides but still polar.

Given the presence of the phosphate and amide, the property value is likely **lower than 0.25** but higher than fully halogenated or nitro compounds (0.0). The thioether might slightly increase the value compared to purely polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the trends, a reasonable estimate is **0.2**, similar to `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` but without the chlorides.

**Final Answer: 0.2**
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CC1CCCC1, CCCCO, CCCC(C)C) tend to have property values of 1.0.
2. Molecules with halogen atoms (especially multiple Cl or Br atoms) often have property values of 0.0 (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12).
3. Molecules with double bonds (C=C) that are part of simple structures tend to have intermediate values (e.g., CCCC(=C)C has 0.66666667, CCC=O has 0.66666667).
4. The presence of conjugated systems or aromatic rings with halogens tends to drive the value toward 0.0.

The molecule in question is Cl\C=C/Cl (1,2-dichloroethene). This is a simple halogenated alkene with no aromaticity or complex functional groups. 

Given that:
- Simple alkenes with halogens tend to have intermediate values (not 1.0 or 0.0)
- The molecule is symmetric and small, similar to CCCC(=C)C (which has 0.66666667) but with halogens (which typically reduce the value)

A reasonable prediction would be slightly lower than 0.66666667 due to the presence of halogens but not as low as 0.0 because it's not aromatic or heavily halogenated. 

Predicted property value: **0.5** (a balance between the alkene nature and the halogen effect).
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the property value tends to be **0.0** for aromatic or conjugated systems that are relatively simple and lack significant functional groups or branching. 

For the molecule **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)**, which is a simple aromatic heterocycle with no additional functional groups or complex substituents, the property value is likely to be **0.0**. This is consistent with other simple aromatic systems in the dataset (e.g., `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43`, `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, etc.), which all have a property value of **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 0.15789473684210525
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (1.0 or close):**
   - Simple aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., **CCC**, **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**).
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., **ClCCCl**, **BrC(Br)Br**).
   - Thioethers (e.g., **CSC**, **CC(C)SC(C)C**).

2. **Low Property Values (0.0 or close):**
   - Aromatic systems, especially polycyclic (e.g., **c1ccc2cnccc2c1**, **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**).
   - Highly halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**).
   - Conjugated systems with nitrogen (e.g., **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3**).

3. **Intermediate Values (0.1–0.5):**
   - Aromatics with simple substituents (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1Cl** → 0.14285714).
   - Mixed aliphatic-aromatic structures (e.g., **CC(=O)c1ccccc1** → 0.125).
   - Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., **CC#C** → 0.33333333, **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C** → 0.36363636).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** has:
1. **Polar Aliphatic Part (OCC(O)COC(=O))**: This resembles fragments like **OCC(O)C(O)...** (high property value).
2. **Aromatic System with Substituents (c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)**:
   - Contains a **Cl** substituent (lowers value, e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** → 0.0).
   - **Nc2ccnc3...** introduces nitrogen in a conjugated system (similar to **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** → 0.0).
   - The **C(=O)** linker is present in examples like **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** → 0.33333333.

### Balancing Contributions:
- The aliphatic part would push the value higher (toward 0.5+).
- The aromatic/heteroaromatic system with **Cl** and **N** would push it lower (toward 0.0–0.2).
- The **C(=O)** linker and **N** substitution suggest an intermediate value.

### Closest Analogues:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** → 0.22222222 (similar ester + aromatic nitro).
- **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C** → 0.36363636 (amide + aromatic ether).
- **Nc2ccnc3...** is akin to nitrogenous heterocycles (low values).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the competing effects, the value is likely **between 0.2 and 0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:

**0.28571429**  
*(This is a weighted guess based on the examples, leaning toward the lower end due to the conjugated nitrogen and chlorine, but offset slightly by the polar aliphatic chain.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular flexibility, symmetry, and the presence of polar or functional groups. The property tends to be higher (closer to 1.0) for simple, symmetric, or highly flexible molecules (e.g., CSSC, CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O, C1CCC2CCCCC2C1) and lower (closer to 0.0) for rigid, aromatic, or highly polar/charged structures (e.g., O=N(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1, Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12).

For the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
1. It is a flexible aliphatic chain with a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH), which introduces some polarity but not rigidity.
2. Similar molecules like **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol) have a property value of **1.0**, likely due to their flexibility and symmetry.
3. Linear alcohols like **CCCCCO** are less symmetric but still flexible, so the value might be slightly lower than cyclic or branched analogs.

Given the trend, **CCCCCO** is predicted to have a property value of **1.0**, as the flexibility dominates over the minor polarity introduced by the -OH group. 

**Predicted property value: 1.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**, a **carbonyl group (C=O)**, and a **benzene ring (c2ccccc2)** attached to an **N-H group (N)**. It also has a **heterocyclic ring (CCO1)** with an **alkene (C=C)** and a **methyl group (CC)**.
2. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: 
   - The sulfonyl and carbonyl groups are polar and can contribute to higher property values (as seen in molecules with similar polar groups like esters, amides, or sulfonates).
   - The benzene ring with no strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups (just an amide linkage) suggests moderate influence.
   - The heterocyclic ring with an oxygen (ether-like) may increase the property value slightly.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **CCCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.4): Contains a sulfonyl-like (P=S) and nitro group; somewhat similar polarity.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (property = 0.625): Contains multiple amides and a cyclic structure; higher value due to polar groups.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (property = 0.125): Contains an amide and fluorinated benzene; lower due to halogen.
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (property = 0.857): Simple ketone; high value due to carbonyl.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of **both sulfonyl and carbonyl groups** suggests a higher property value (similar to molecules with multiple polar groups).
- The lack of halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or multiple halogens) prevents the value from being very low (e.g., 0.0).
- The heterocyclic ring with oxygen may contribute similarly to ethers or cyclic esters (which often have values in the 0.4–0.6 range).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar groups (sulfonyl, carbonyl) and the absence of strong deactivating substituents, a reasonable estimate is **~0.5**. Looking at similar examples, **0.53333333** (for **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**) is a close match due to the sulfonyl-like (P=S) and ester groups.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1** is:  
**0.53333333** (or approximately **0.53**).

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.29411764705882354
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular flexibility, branching, and the presence of certain functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, rings, etc.). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES**: `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC`  
**Structure Highlights**:
1. Contains a **fused ring system** (benzene attached to a non-aromatic heterocycle with nitrogen).
2. Has **two ester groups** (`COC=O` and `C(=O)OC`).
3. Includes a **nitro group** (`N(=O)=O`) on the benzene ring.
4. Features **methyl substituents** (`C`) on the heterocycle.
5. The structure is **rigid** due to the fused rings and conjugated system.

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Rigid or aromatic systems** (e.g., polycyclic aromatics, halogenated aromatics) tend to have **low property values (0.0 or close)**:
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene): 0.0  
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene): 0.0  
   - `c1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (fluorene): 0.07692308  

2. **Flexible or branched aliphatic chains** tend to have **high property values (1.0 or close)**:
   - `CCC(C)(C)CC`: 1.0  
   - `CCCCCC`: 1.0  
   - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)C`: 1.0  

3. **Moderate values** occur when there is a mix of rigidity and flexibility or polar groups:
   - `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid-like): 0.73913043  
   - `CC(C)c1ccccc1` (toluene derivative): 0.33333333  

4. **Nitro groups** often reduce the property value when attached to rigid systems:
   - `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`: 0.14285714  
   - `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2` (nitrogen heterocycle): 0.18181818  

### Prediction for Given Molecule:
- The molecule is **highly rigid** due to the fused ring system and conjugation.
- The **nitro group** further reduces flexibility.
- The **esters** add some polarity but don't significantly increase flexibility.
- Comparable examples suggest values **between 0.1 and 0.3**.

Given the presence of the nitro group and fused rings, the closest analogs are:
- `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2`: 0.18181818  
- `Cc1cccc2ccccc12`: 0.09090909  
- `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O`: 0.30769231  

The given molecule is slightly more rigid than these, so the value should be **on the lower end of this range**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.15384615**  
(Roughly midway between 0.09090909 and 0.18181818, accounting for the nitro group's impact.)

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.5
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to deduce a pattern for the property.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a bicyclic structure with two amide (N-C=O) groups and a cyclopropane ring (C1(CC1)). The SMILES representation shows:
- Two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to nitrogen (N), forming imide-like functionality.
- A cyclopropane ring (3-membered carbon ring) fused to the imide structure.

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Cyclic and Polycyclic Structures**: 
   - Fully saturated rings (e.g., `C1CCCCC1`) tend to have high property values (1.0).
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Clc1cccc(I)c1`) tend to have low property values (0.0), unless they have polar or flexible substituents.
   - Partially saturated or heterocyclic structures (e.g., `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C`) have intermediate values (0.68181818).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Amides/carbonyls (e.g., `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`) often contribute to higher values (0.81818182).
   - Rigid or constrained rings (e.g., cyclopropane) may reduce the property value compared to larger, more flexible rings.

3. **Symmetry and Constraints**:
   - The cyclopropane ring introduces high rigidity, which might lower the property compared to larger rings.
   - The imide (two amides in a ring) is polar but constrained, similar to some intermediate examples.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (0.81818182): Multiple rings and carbonyls, but larger and more flexible.
- `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` (0.68181818): Complex polycyclic with heteroatoms and constraints.
- `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2` (0.28571429): Cyclopropane with substituents.

Given the rigidity of the cyclopropane and the imide, but the polarity of the carbonyls, the property value is likely **intermediate**. 

### Predicted Property:
The molecule is rigid but polar, similar to structures with values around **0.6-0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.66666667** (same as `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`, which also has a balance of rings and polar groups). 

However, the cyclopropane's extreme rigidity might slightly reduce this. Adjusting downward:

**Final prediction: 0.6** (or exactly **0.6** if interpolating between examples). 

But looking back, the closest analog is the steroid-like structure with value **0.66666667**, so I'll stick with:

**Predicted property value: 0.66666667** (2/3). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is based on structural similarity to the given examples. The property could represent flexibility, solubility, or another descriptor favoring saturated/polar over aromatic/rigid systems.)
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property value appears to correlate with molecular complexity, presence of halogens (especially chlorine), and saturation (single vs. double/triple bonds). Here are the key patterns:

1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCCC`, `CCC1CCCCC1`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Chlorinated molecules** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) consistently have a property value of **0.0** when chlorine is attached to an aromatic ring or polyhalogenated.
3. **Simple chloroalkanes** (e.g., `ClCC`) are not explicitly in the examples, but analogous cases suggest:
   - `CC#N` (a simple nitrile) has a value of **0.5**, implying that simple functionalized small molecules may have intermediate values.
   - `C1CC=CC1` (cyclopentene) has **0.6**, while `C1CCC=CCC1` (cycloheptene) has **0.714**, suggesting unsaturation reduces the value slightly compared to alkanes.
   - `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` (a complex polyhalogenated molecule) has **0.666**, but this is likely due to its complexity rather than just chlorine.

For **ClCC** (chloroethane):
- It is a simple chloroalkane with no unsaturation or aromaticity.
- Compared to `CC#N` (0.5), which is similarly small and functionalized, and `Clc1ccccc1` (0.0), which is aromatic and chlorinated, **ClCC** is likely closer to **0.5** but slightly lower due to the presence of chlorine.
- No other simple chloroalkanes are in the examples, but the trend suggests a value between **0.0** (for aromatic/polyhalogenated) and **1.0** (for pure alkanes).

Given these observations, the most reasonable prediction for **ClCC** is:  
**0.4** (intermediate between 0.0 and 0.5, accounting for the chlorine's reducing effect).  

(Note: If the property is binary-like with discrete steps, it might instead be **0.5**, but the examples suggest a continuous scale, so **0.4** is more plausible.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.16666666666666666
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br, F, I) aliphatic or non-aromatic structures** tend to have a property value of **1.0**:
   - Examples: 
     - `ClCC(Cl)Cl` → 1.0
     - `BrC(Cl)Cl` → 1.0
     - `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...` (full halogenation) → 1.0
     - `CCC(C)(C)Cl` → 1.0

2. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions** tend to have a property value of **0.0**:
   - Examples:
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → 0.0
     - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2` → 0.0
     - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` → 0.0
     - `Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl` → 0.0

3. **Mixed cases (aromatic + aliphatic halogenation)** tend to have **intermediate values**:
   - Example:
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → 0.14285714 (aromatic + CCl3 group)
     - `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...` → 0.6 (aliphatic Cl + other groups)

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which consists of:
- A **chlorinated pyridine ring (Clc1ccccn1)** (aromatic with Cl substitution).
- A **CCl3 group (trichloromethyl)** attached to the pyridine.

This is a **mixed case**: 
- The aromatic pyridine with Cl substitution would typically contribute to a **lower property value (near 0.0)**.
- The **CCl3 group** (aliphatic halogenation) would typically contribute to a **higher property value (near 1.0)**.

From similar examples:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (two aromatic rings + CCl3) → **0.14285714**
- `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...` (aliphatic Cl + other groups) → **0.6**

Given that our molecule has **one aromatic ring + CCl3**, the property value should be **higher than 0.14285714 but lower than 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is around **0.25–0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
Considering the balance between aromatic and aliphatic halogenation, the predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is:

**0.28571429** (or approximately **2/7**). 

This aligns with the trend where mixed halogenation yields intermediate values, and the presence of the CCl3 group raises the value slightly compared to purely aromatic halogenated molecules.

To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols (with -OH group and no other functional groups)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = 1.0
   - **CCC(C)CCO**: Property = 1.0
   - **CCC(CC)CO**: Property = 1.0
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property = 0.25 (lower due to aromatic ring)
   - **CC(O)CCC**: Not explicitly given, but similar to **CCCC(O)CCC** (property = 1.0).

   These examples suggest that simple aliphatic alcohols (with -OH group and no other functional groups or complicating features like rings or halogens) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.

2. **Other Functional Groups or Structural Features**:
   - Aromatic rings, halogens, or other heteroatoms tend to reduce the property value (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1** = 0.14285714, **ClC=C** = 0.0).
   - Branching in aliphatic chains does not seem to reduce the property value for alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO** = 1.0).

### Analysis of **CCCCC(C)O**:
- This is a branched aliphatic alcohol (2-hexanol). 
- It has no aromatic rings, halogens, or other functional groups.
- It is structurally similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (property = 1.0) and **CCCC(O)CCC** (property = 1.0).

### Conclusion:
The property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is most likely **1.0**, consistent with other simple aliphatic alcohols in the given examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.0**

Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1` (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Fully halogenated aliphatic compounds** (e.g., `ClCCl`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents**:
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (dichlorobiphenyl) has a value of **0.0**.
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` (dichlorophenol) has a value of **0.0**.
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.06666667`.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (1,4-dichlorobenzene) is not explicitly listed, but similar structures suggest low values (close to 0).
3. **Non-halogenated aromatic systems** (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1`, `c1ccccc1SC`) tend to have low or zero values unless functionalized with specific groups.
4. **Brominated aromatics** are not explicitly in the examples, but bromine and chlorine behave similarly in these contexts.

### Prediction for `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1` (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- This is structurally analogous to `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (1,4-dichlorobenzene), which would likely have a value close to **0.0** based on the examples of halogenated aromatics.
- The presence of two halogens (bromine) on the aromatic ring does not introduce significant polarity or functional groups that would increase the property value (as seen in the examples where such structures have values of 0 or near 0).

### Final Prediction:
The property value for `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1` is **0.0**.

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly halogenated aromatic systems** (especially with Cl or Br) tend to have a property value of **0.0**:
   - Example: `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0** (fully chlorinated biphenyl-like structure).
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` → **0.0** (nitro-substituted aromatic).
   - Example: `c1cc(O)c(O)c2OCC3(O)CC4=CC(=O)C(O)=CC4=C3c21` → **0.1875** (less halogenated, more functional groups).

2. **The given molecule** is a **hexachlorinated biphenyl derivative** (similar to the first example but with slightly fewer Cl atoms). The symmetry and high degree of chlorination suggest it is **highly hydrophobic/sterically hindered**, aligning with the **0.0** trend.

3. **Non-halogenated or less halogenated molecules** with flexible/aliphatic structures or polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O, O-alkyl) tend to have higher values (e.g., 0.75, 1.0).

### Prediction:
The molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure**, heavily chlorinated and rigid/aromatic. This matches the examples with **0.0** property values.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 0.14285714285714285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular properties such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and the presence of functional groups. Here's my reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring). Aromatic rings are present in many of the examples, and their contribution to the property depends on substitution.
2. **Phosphate Group (OP(=O)(...)...)**: This is a polar and bulky group. In the examples, polar groups like carbonyls, hydroxyls, and phosphates tend to lower the property value unless balanced by hydrophobic groups.
3. **Methyl Substituents (C)**: The molecule has methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings. Methyl groups are hydrophobic and can increase the property value (e.g., `CCCC` has a value of 1.0, and `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has 0.333).
4. **Ether Linkages (Oc...)**: These are polar but not as strongly as hydroxyl or carbonyl groups. They may moderately lower the property.
5. **Overall Polarity**: The phosphate group is highly polar, but the molecule also has significant hydrophobic regions (aromatic rings with methyl groups).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` with 0.315) tend to have lower values.
- Molecules with hydrophobic dominance (e.g., `CCCC` with 1.0) have higher values.
- The phosphate group is similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (value 0.428) and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` (value 1.0). The latter is less polar due to lack of additional polar groups, while the former is more polar and has a lower value.
- The given molecule has a phosphate group but also significant hydrophobic character from the aromatic rings and methyl groups.

### Prediction:
The molecule has a mix of polar (phosphate) and hydrophobic (aromatic + methyl) regions. The phosphate group will likely dominate, pulling the value down, but the hydrophobic regions will prevent it from being very low. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (0.428) is somewhat similar in polarity.
- `CC(C)c1ccccc1` (0.333) is simpler but has hydrophobic + aromatic character.

Given the additional polar phosphate group, I predict a value slightly lower than 0.428 but higher than 0.333. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.4** (This aligns with the balance of polar and hydrophobic features in the molecule.)

Iteration: 70
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.4166666666666667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the molecule (attached to the benzene ring). From the examples, molecules with CF3 or halogen-rich groups (e.g., Cl, F) often have lower property values (e.g., 0.14285714 for Cl-rich molecules). However, CF3 alone doesn't always imply a very low value (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C has 0.36363636).
   
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The benzene ring has a CF3 and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached. Aromatic systems with nitro (NO2) or electron-withdrawing groups tend to have lower values (e.g., 0.14285714 for Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O). Here, the CF3 is electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as NO2.

3. **Heterocycle with carbonyl and chlorines**: The N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O moiety includes:
   - A carbonyl (C=O) group, which is polar but doesn't necessarily lower the value (e.g., esters like COC(=O)C have 0.66666667).
   - Two chlorine atoms, which are electronegative and bulky. Chlorines often reduce the property value (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 has 0.14285714).

4. **No hydroxyl (OH) or long aliphatic chains**: Molecules with OH or long aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCO) tend to have higher values (1.0 or close). This molecule lacks these features.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are molecules with:
  - Multiple halogens (Cl/F) and aromatic systems (e.g., 0.14285714 for ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2).
  - CF3 and polar groups (e.g., 0.36363636 for CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C).
  - Heterocycles with chlorines (e.g., 0.55555556 for CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)(C)C#N)n1).

Given the presence of CF3, two chlorines, and a polar heterocycle, the property value is likely **lower** but not zero (since there are no nitro groups or fused polyaromatics, which often give 0.0). 

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **0.25**, balancing the effects of CF3, chlorines, and the carbonyl group. This aligns with examples like:
- COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (0.125, ester + aromatic)
- Cc1ccccc1C (0.25, simple aromatic with small substituents)
- ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (0.14285714, multiple chlorines).

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.25**

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.14285714285714285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group directly attached to an aromatic ring often have low or zero property values. For example:
     - `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` → 0.0
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → 0.0
     - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol, no nitro) → 0.0, but nitro-aromatics seem to reinforce this trend.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and may correlate with low property values in this dataset.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - The methoxy group (`OCH3`) is present in some molecules, but its effect seems secondary to other dominant features (e.g., nitro groups or hydroxyl groups). For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` → 0.2 (esters dominate here).
     - `COc2ccc1ncccc1c2` → 0.0 (nitrogenous heterocycle likely dominates).

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems without polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` → 0.0) tend to have low values.
   - Substitution with nitro or other electron-withdrawing groups further lowers the value.

4. **Hydroxyl Groups (OH)**:
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (`OH`) often have high property values (e.g., `CCO` → 1.0, `OCC(O)C(O)CO` → 1.0). This suggests that hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors may increase the property value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene, or nitroanisole). Key features:
- Aromatic ring with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) and a methoxy group (`OCH3`).
- The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and likely dominates the property value.
- The methoxy group is weakly electron-donating but unlikely to offset the nitro group's effect.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) → 0.0
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) → 0.0
- `COc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (methoxy-indole) → 0.0

The presence of the nitro group suggests the property value will be **0.0** or very low. The methoxy group does not appear to significantly increase the value in other examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**

Iteration: 72
SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.8
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule is a polycyclic alkane with **8 chlorine atoms** attached to it (fully substituted). This resembles **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane) from the examples, which has a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Fully Substituted Halogens**: The examples show that fully halogenated (Cl, Br) aliphatic or cyclic structures tend to have high property values (often **1.0**), e.g., **ClCCCl (1.0)**, **BrC(Br)Br (1.0)**, **CCCCl (1.0)**, etc.
3. **No Polar or Functional Groups**: The molecule lacks polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (like -OH, -NO2, -NH2, etc.), which in the examples tend to lower the property value (often to **0.0** or near-zero).
4. **Symmetry and Rigidity**: The rigid, cage-like structure with high chlorine substitution further supports a high property value, similar to other fully halogenated systems.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**: Property = **1.0** (fully chlorinated cyclohexane).
- **ClCCCl**: Property = **1.0** (simple dichloroalkane).
- **BrC(Br)Br**: Property = **1.0** (fully brominated methane).
- **CCCCl**: Property = **1.0** (simple chloroalkane).

The given molecule is even more heavily chlorinated than these examples, so the property value should logically be **1.0**.

### Counterexamples:
Molecules with polar/nitro/hydroxy groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**) have property values of **0.0**, but this molecule lacks such groups.

### Conclusion:
The property value is almost certainly **1.0**.

**Predicted property value: 1.0**

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Fully saturated hydrocarbons or fully halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `C1CCCCCC1`, `CC(Cl)Cl`, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
2. **Aromatic rings without polar or reactive substituents** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23`, `Clc1ccccc1I`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
3. **Molecules with polar or functional groups** (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(C)c(Cl)c1`, `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O`) have intermediate values between 0.0 and 1.0, depending on the nature and number of functional groups.
4. **Molecules with ester groups** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`) tend to have values around **0.2-0.3**.
5. **Molecules with simple aldehydes or ketones** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O`) have values around **0.25**.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O**:
- This is an ester (propyl formate), similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), which has a value of **0.22222222**.
- The molecule lacks aromaticity or additional polar groups, so the value should be in the lower range of esters.
- Compared to other esters in the examples, the simplest ester (`CCOC=O`) would likely have a value slightly lower than **0.25**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is approximately **0.2**. 

However, since the examples show esters with values like **0.22222222** and **0.25**, and this is a simpler ester, a reasonable prediction is:

**0.2** (or more precisely, **0.22222222** to match the closest ester example). 

For consistency with the given examples, I'll predict:  
**0.22222222** (same as `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`). 

But since `CCCOC=O` is simpler, a slightly lower value like **0.2** might also fit. Given the data, the closest match is **0.22222222**.

### Final Answer:
**0.22222222**
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9166666666666666
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule is a **fatty acid ester**: it has a long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**C(=O)OCC**).
   - The ester group is polar, but the long hydrophobic chain dominates the overall properties.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (benzene with a hexyl chain): Property = **0.5**.
     - This is a hydrophobic alkyl chain attached to an aromatic ring. The property value is moderate (0.5), likely due to the balance between the hydrophobic chain and the aromatic ring.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): Not in the examples, but similar esters with shorter chains (e.g., **CCOc1ccccc1**, property = **0.25**) suggest esters with small polar groups have lower values.
   - **CCCCCCCCCC** (decane): Not in the examples, but fully aliphatic chains like **CC** (ethane, property = **1.0**) and **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexylpropane, property = **1.0**) suggest long aliphatic chains tend to have high property values (close to 1.0).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Long aliphatic chains (**CCCCCCCCC**) increase the property value (as seen with **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** = 0.5 and fully aliphatic molecules = 1.0).
   - The ester group (**C(=O)OCC**) introduces some polarity, which likely reduces the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the long hydrophobic chain and the modest polarity of the ester group, the property value should be **closer to 0.5** (like **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**) but slightly lower due to the ester's polarity. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) = **0.5**.
- **CCOc1ccccc1** (ethoxybenzene) = **0.25** (smaller alkyl + polar group).

Since **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** has a much longer chain than **CCOc1ccccc1** but a polar ester group, a reasonable estimate is **between 0.5 and 0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.55** (interpolating between the examples). 

However, reviewing the examples again, **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (a branched aldehyde with some unsaturation) has a property of **0.625**, and **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (another aldehyde) has **0.875**. Since our molecule is a long-chain ester, it is less polar than an aldehyde but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon. Thus, a value slightly lower than **0.625** seems appropriate.

Given the lack of exact matches, the most plausible prediction is:  
**0.5** (same as **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, as the ester's polarity roughly balances the longer chain). 

But considering the trend for long aliphatic chains with small polar groups, a slightly higher value (e.g., **0.6**) is also reasonable. 

Given the examples, **0.5** is the safest choice. 

### Final Answer:
**0.5**

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two benzene rings, which are common in the examples. Aromatic rings alone (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**, but substitutions can change this.
2. **Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present in multiple positions. From examples like `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.14285714) and `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (0.0), Cl substitutions can reduce the property value but not always to zero.
   - **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: This group appears in `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (0.0) and tends to drive the property toward zero.
   - **Hydroxy Group (OH)**: Present in `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (0.0) and `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.14285714). It often reduces the property but not as strongly as nitro.
   - **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Present in `NC(=O)c1ccccc1` (0.0) and other examples, which also tends to lower the property.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule has multiple polar and electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, NO2, OH, amide), which collectively suggest a low property value.
   - Examples with similar combinations (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) have a value of **0.0**, while slightly less polar examples like `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` have **0.14285714**.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the presence of other polar substituents, the property value is likely **0.0** or very close to it. The examples suggest that such heavily substituted aromatic systems tend to have minimal property values.

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains (e.g., CCCC...)**:
   - Molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCCCO`) tend to have a property value of **1.0**.
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., OH, CO) in aliphatic chains can retain the value of 1.0 if the chain is still largely hydrophobic (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C` = 0.666, but `CCCC(C)O` = 1.0).

2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene, heterocycles)**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless substituted with specific functional groups.
   - Substitution with halogens (Cl, Br) or other non-polar groups often retains 0.0 (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = 0.0).
   - Substitution with polar groups (e.g., OH, CO, N) can slightly increase the value (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 0.125).

3. **Phosphorothioate Groups (e.g., P(=S)(OC)OC)**:
   - The molecule `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **0.46153846**.
   - The presence of `P(=S)(OC)` seems to contribute to a mid-range value (~0.46) when combined with aromatic and aliphatic parts.

4. **Sulfur Linkages (e.g., S, Sc1ccc...)**:
   - Thioether linkages (e.g., `CCSSCC` = 1.0) tend to increase the value if in an aliphatic context.
   - In aromatic contexts (e.g., `Sc1ccc...`), the effect is less clear, but the property tends to be lower unless combined with other features.

5. **Symmetry and Repetition**:
   - The given molecule has a symmetric structure with two `P(=S)(OC)OC` groups linked via a thioether (`S`)-bridged aromatic system. This is somewhat similar to the `COP(=S)(OC)SCC...` example (value = 0.46153846), but with more aromaticity and less aliphatic character.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- The molecule is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**.
- It contains:
  1. Two `P(=S)(OC)OC` groups (similar to the example with value 0.46153846).
  2. Aromatic rings (`c1ccc...`) linked by a thioether (`S`).
  3. No long aliphatic chains; the structure is dominated by aromatic and polar phosphorothioate groups.
- Compared to the example `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (value = 0.46153846), this molecule has:
  - More aromatic rings (reducing the value toward 0.0).
  - No aliphatic `SCC` linker (reducing the value).
  - Symmetric `P(=S)(OC)` groups (may balance the effect).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the dominance of aromatic rings and the presence of two `P(=S)(OC)` groups, the value is likely **lower than 0.46153846** but higher than pure aromatics (0.0). A reasonable estimate is **~0.3**. 

However, looking at similar examples:
- `CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C` (mixed aromatic/polar) = 0.23076923.
- `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (alkyl-substituted aromatic) = 0.4.

Given the symmetric `P(=S)(OC)` groups and aromatic-thioether linkage, the value is likely **~0.25**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.25** (similar to the example `CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C`).
==================================================
Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (`N(=O)=O`)**:
   - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`: Property = 0.0
   - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`: Property = 0.14285714
   - `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1`: Property = 0.0 (no nitro group, but has amino group)
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`: Property = 0.0 (no nitro group)
   - Molecules with `N(=O)=O` tend to have low property values (0.0 or close to 0.0).

2. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (`OH` or `O` attached to aromatic ring)**:
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: Property = 0.0
   - `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`: Property = 0.25
   - Hydroxyl groups alone do not necessarily lead to high property values.

3. **Combination of Hydroxyl and Nitro Groups**:
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both a hydroxyl group (`O` attached to the aromatic ring) and a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`). 
   - From the examples, the presence of a nitro group strongly correlates with low property values (often 0.0 or slightly higher). The hydroxyl group does not seem to counteract this effect significantly.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic systems with no polar or functional groups (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24`) have property = 0.0.
   - Functional groups like nitro or halogens reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a nitro group, which is strongly associated with low property values in the examples. The hydroxyl group does not seem to elevate the property value significantly when combined with a nitro group. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`: Property = 0.0 (nitro + hydroxyl + halogens)
- `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`: Property = 0.14285714 (nitro group alone, no hydroxyl)
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: Property = 0.0 (hydroxyl + halogens, no nitro)

Given that the nitro group dominates the property value, and the hydroxyl group does not counteract this, the most likely property value for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
0.0

50. **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (a polychlorinated biphenyl)**: 0.0

### Step 2: Identifying Patterns

Looking at these examples, I'm trying to find what correlates with higher or lower property values. Here are some observations:

- **Simple alkanes and alcohols**: 
  - CCCC... (long alkane): 1.0
  - CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (branched alcohol): 1.0
  - C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (sugar alcohol): 1.0
  - CBr (simple alkyl halide): 1.0
  These seem to have the highest property value of 1.0.

- **Highly halogenated (especially chlorinated or brominated) aromatic compounds**:
  - Clc1cc(Cl)c... : 0.0
  - Brc1cc(Br)... : 0.0
  - Ic1cccc2ccccc12: 0.0
  These consistently have a property value of 0.0.

- **Compounds with nitrile groups (-C#N)**:
  - CCC#N: 0.666...
  - NC(N)=NC#N: 0.0 (but this also has other features)
  - ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N: 0.5
  - CCC#CCC: 0.666...
  - CCCC#C: 0.6
  Nitriles seem to give values around 0.5 to 0.666...

- **Compounds with amides or cyclic amides**:
  - O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC: 0.625
  - NC(=O)NCc1ccccc1: 0.125
  - O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2: 0.0
  These vary, but amides seem to reduce the value compared to simple alkanes.

- **Compounds with aromatic rings and heteroatoms**:
  - COc1ccccc1O: 0.142...
  - CCOc1ccccc1: 0.25
  - c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24 (polyaromatic): 0.0
  Aromaticity seems to lower the value, especially with halogens.

- **Compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups**:
  - C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O: 1.0
  - CC34CCC1C(CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CC(O)C4O: 0.666...
  Multiple OH groups seem to increase the value, similar to simple alkanes.

### Step 3: Hypothesizing the Property

Given these observations, the property seems to relate to the "simplicity" or "saturation" of the molecule:

- **High values (close to 1.0)**: Simple alkanes, alcohols, sugars (no unsaturation, no halogens, no aromaticity).
- **Low values (close to 0.0)**: Highly halogenated aromatics, polyaromatics.
- **Intermediate values**: Presence of nitriles, amides, some unsaturation, or limited aromaticity.

This suggests the property might be something like "degree of saturation" or "lack of aromaticity/halogenation". Perhaps it's a measure of how "aliphatic" or "non-aromatic" the molecule is, with fully saturated aliphatics scoring 1.0 and highly aromatic/halogenated scoring 0.0.

### Step 4: Analyzing the New Molecule

The new molecule is:

**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**

This is a complex sugar-like molecule with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages. Let's break it down:

- It's a carbohydrate derivative with multiple -OH groups.
- It has no aromatic rings, no halogens, no nitriles, no amides.
- It's highly oxygenated but fully saturated (no double or triple bonds outside of the ring structures).

Comparing to the examples:

- C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (a simple sugar alcohol): 1.0
- CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (a branched alcohol): 1.0
- Other complex sugars or polyols also seem to have high values when they lack aromaticity or unsaturation.

Given that this molecule is even more complex but still fits the profile of a highly oxygenated, saturated, non-aromatic molecule like the simple sugar alcohol that scored 1.0, it's reasonable to predict a high value.

### Step 5: Considering Complexity

However, the molecule is more complex than the simple sugar alcohol. Maybe complexity reduces the value slightly, but looking at other complex molecules:

- CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O: 0.947...
- CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C: 0.818...
These are complex but still have high values if they're not aromatic/halogenated.

Our molecule is more like the simple sugar but larger, so likely still close to 1.0.

### Step 6: Final Prediction

Given that:

- Simple alkanes/alcohols: 1.0
- Complex but saturated/aliphatic: high (0.8-1.0)
- No aromaticity/halogens/unsaturation in our molecule

The most reasonable prediction is **1.0**.

### Step 7: Verifying with Similar Examples

- C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O: 1.0 (very similar in functionality)
- CC(C)CC(C)(C)O: 1.0 (simpler but same idea)
- CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O: 0.947... (complex but high)

Our molecule is more like the first two, so 1.0 seems correct.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing the given examples and comparing the structural features of the new molecule to those, the predicted property value is:

**1.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.5
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with terminal hydroxyl groups (-OH)** tend to have high property values (often 1.0 or close):
   - `CCCC(O)CCC` → 1.0
   - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 1.0
   - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 1.0  
   These are aliphatic alcohols with -OH at the end of a chain.

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, ether, ester, amide)** often have intermediate values (between 0.1 and 0.8):
   - `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` → 0.818  
     (multiple carbonyls and rings)
   - `CC(C)OC=O` → 0.75  
     (ester-like structure)
   - `CC(=O)c1ccccc1` → 0.125  
     (aromatic ketone)

3. **Molecules with no polar groups or conjugation (e.g., pure hydrocarbons, halogens, nitro groups)** tend to have low or zero values:
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` → 0.333  
     (alkyl-substituted benzene, weakly polar)
   - `Fc1cccc(F)c1` → 0.0  
     (symmetrical halogenated benzene)
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` → 0.0  
     (pure polyaromatic hydrocarbon)
   - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` → 0.0  
     (symmetrical dinitrile, no net polarity)

4. **Alkynes** are present in some examples:
   - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` → 0.0  
     (symmetrical, no net polarity)
   - `CCC#C` is a terminal alkyne (1-butyne), which has a slight polarity due to the C-H bond of the terminal alkyne (sp-hybridized carbon is more electronegative than sp³).

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- The terminal alkyne (C≡C-H) has a weakly polar C-H bond, but the molecule is otherwise nonpolar (no other functional groups).  
- Similar weakly polar hydrocarbons (e.g., `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1`) have values around **0.3–0.4**.  
- Symmetrical/nonpolar alkynes (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`) have **0.0**.  

Given that **CCC#C** is not symmetrical and has a slight polarity, but no strong functional groups, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

(Note: This is an interpolated guess based on the examples. The actual property might be a specific value like 0.25, 0.2, or 0.3, but it should fall in this range.)
==================================================
Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (close to 1.0)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCCCC**, **CC(C)C(O)C(C)C**) or small functionalized alkanes (e.g., **CCSCC**, **ClC(Br)Br**) tend to have high values (1.0 or close).
   - Molecules with few or no aromatic rings and no heavy halogens (e.g., **CCCC=C**, **CCC(=O)CC**) also have relatively high values.

2. **Low Property Values (close to 0.0)**:
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (e.g., **c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)**, **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56**) or heavy halogen substitution (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) tend to have low or zero values.
   - Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or multiple heteroatoms (e.g., **O=c1cc[nH]c(=O)[nH]1**) also have low values.

3. **Intermediate Values**:
   - Molecules with a mix of aliphatic and aromatic components (e.g., **CC12CCC(=O)C=C1CCC3C2CCC4(C)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have intermediate values (e.g., 0.4–0.8).
   - Phosphorothioate groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) are associated with intermediate values (~0.46 in this case).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is: **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**
- Contains a **phosphorothioate group (P(=S))** which is also present in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.46153846).
- Has an aromatic ring with **three chlorine substitutions (Cl)**, similar to **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.0) but with an additional phosphorothioate group.
- The presence of the **ethoxy (CCO)** and **ethyl (CC)** groups adds some aliphatic character, which may increase the value slightly compared to purely aromatic/chlorinated molecules.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.46153846):
   - Phosphorothioate + aromatic ring with one chlorine substitution.
   - Our molecule has more chlorines but similar phosphorothioate and aliphatic components.
2. **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.0):
   - Pure aromatic with multiple chlorines (no phosphorothioate or aliphatic chains).

### Prediction:
The phosphorothioate group likely increases the value compared to purely chlorinated aromatics (which are 0.0), but the multiple chlorines will suppress the value compared to simpler phosphorothioates. Given the similarity to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.46153846) but with more chlorines, the value should be slightly lower.

### Final Prediction:
**Property Value = 0.4** (rounded from an estimated range of 0.35–0.45). 

This balances the positive contribution of the phosphorothioate/aliphatic groups with the negative contribution of the heavily chlorinated aromatic ring.
==================================================
Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~1.0 or close):**
   - Simple aliphatic chains or rings with minimal functional groups (e.g., `ClCC(C)C`, `CC1=CCCCC1`, `CCCCBr`, `CCCCCCC`, `CC(C)C`).
   - No aromatic rings or very simple substitutions (e.g., halogens like Cl or Br).

2. **Low Property Values (~0.0 or close):**
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12`, `Nc1cccc2ccccc12`).
   - Heteroaromatic rings (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`, `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2`).
   - Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I`).

3. **Intermediate Property Values (0.1 - 0.7):**
   - Molecules with a mix of aromatic and aliphatic features or moderate polarity (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `CC(=O)CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O`).
   - Substituents like carbonyls, amines, or ethers that reduce the property value but don't make it zero.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`
1. **Structure:**
   - A pyridine ring (`c1nccc`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide group).
   - The pyridine is a heteroaromatic ring, which tends to lower the property value (seen in examples like `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` with value 0.0).
   - The `C(=O)NN` group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds, further reducing the property value.

2. **Comparison to Examples:**
   - Similar to `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (property = 0.0): heteroaromatic + polar/hydrogen-bonding groups.
   - Similar to `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = 0.0): aromatic + nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is more polar than simple amines or halogens, so the property value should be very low.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The molecule is highly aromatic and polar, with no aliphatic or non-polar features to increase the property value.
   - The closest analogs in the examples have property values of 0.0.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.9285714285714286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to be a value between 0 and 1, likely representing some form of molecular descriptor or fractional property (e.g., solubility, polarity, or a topological index).

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds (e.g., Cl, Br, I):** 
   - Molecules like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl` and `BrCBr` have property values of 0.0 or 1.0, suggesting halogens may dominate the property in certain contexts.
   - However, `BrCBr` is 1.0, while `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` is 0.0, indicating the property is not purely based on halogens.

2. **Aliphatic Chains with Functional Groups:**
   - `CCCCCCCI` (1.0) and `CCBr` (1.0) suggest terminal halogens in aliphatic chains give high values.
   - `CCS` (1.0) indicates sulfur-containing aliphatic chains also give high values.

3. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups:**
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` has a value of 0.33333333, suggesting phosphorus groups (like `P(=S)`) contribute moderately.

4. **Amide/Carbonyl Groups:**
   - `CCOC(=O)N` has a value of 0.66666667, indicating amide/carbonyl groups contribute significantly.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` has 0.8, further supporting this.

5. **Complex Structures:**
   - The given molecule has:
     - Aliphatic chains (`CCC`, `OCCC`, `CC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`).
     - A phosphorus group (`P(=S)`).
     - An amide group (`C(=O)N`).
     - Sulfur (`S`).

### Prediction for `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`:
- The molecule has:
  1. A `P(=S)` group (like in `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1`, which contributed 0.333).
  2. An amide group `C(=O)N` (like in `CCOC(=O)N`, which contributed 0.666).
  3. Sulfur (`S`) in a non-terminal position (unlike `CCS`, which was 1.0).
  4. Aliphatic chains (neutral contribution).

Given the combination of `P(=S)` (moderate contribution) and `C(=O)N` (high contribution), the property is likely between 0.5 and 0.7. The sulfur in the middle of the chain may reduce the contribution slightly compared to terminal sulfur.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **0.6** (or more precisely, interpolating between the examples, **0.55555556** to **0.66666667**). 

Given the presence of both `P(=S)` and `C(=O)N`, I would predict:  
**0.6** (or **0.55555556** if aligning closely with similar examples). 

However, looking at `Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O` (which has multiple heteroatoms and carbonyls) with a value of 0.5, and `CCOC(=O)N` with 0.666, the value is likely closer to **0.6**. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.6** (or **0.55555556** to match the precision of the examples). 

For exact alignment with the examples, I would round to **0.55555556**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.55555556**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify a pattern in the property values for the given molecules. The property appears to be related to the **hydrophobicity or solubility** of the molecule, where:

- **Aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., straight or branched chains without polar groups) tend to have a property value of 1.0**. Examples include:
  - `ClCCBr` (1.0)
  - `CC(Cl)Cl` (1.0)
  - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (1.0)
  - `CCC(O)CC` (1.0)
  - `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (1.0)
  - `CCCCCCCO` (1.0)
  - `CC(C)CO` (1.0)
  - `CC(C)CCO` (1.0)
  - `CC(C)(C)CO` (1.0)
  - `CCCC(C)(C)CO` (1.0)
  - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (1.0)
  - `OCC(O)C(O)CO` (1.0).

- **Aromatic or polar molecules (e.g., those with rings, halogens, nitro groups, or other polar substituents) tend to have property values less than 1.0**, often 0.0 or intermediate values.

The molecule in question, `CCCCCCCC` (octane), is a **straight-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon with no polar groups**. Based on the trend observed in the examples, this molecule would almost certainly have a **property value of 1.0**.

### Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: **1.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Symmetric or Saturated Hydrocarbons**: Molecules like **C1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptane)** and **CCCOCCC (diethyl ether)** have a property value of **1.0**. These are fully saturated or simple symmetric structures with no polar/functional groups.
2. **Presence of Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar or reactive functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, halogens, amines) tend to have lower property values. For example:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1 (benzamide)** has a value of **0.0** due to the amide group.
   - **CC(=O)C (acetone)** has a value of **0.8**, showing that a single carbonyl reduces the value but not to zero.
3. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**: Molecules like **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (a steroid-like structure) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.84210526**). These are complex but not fully saturated.
4. **Oxygenated or Hydroxylated Rings**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**) tends to give a value of **1.0**, likely due to symmetry or biological relevance.
5. **Unsaturation and Conjugation**: Molecules with double bonds or aromaticity often have lower values unless they are part of a symmetric system.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The given molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with:
- A steroid-like core (**CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)**).
- Two hydroxyl groups (**O** attached to rings).
- A triple bond (**C#C**) at the end.
- A carbonyl group (**C=O**).

Comparing to similar examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** has a value of **0.84210526**.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** has a value of **0.72727273**.

The given molecule is very similar to these but has an additional triple bond, which may slightly reduce the property value due to increased unsaturation. However, the hydroxyl groups and overall symmetry likely keep the value relatively high.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the examples with values around **0.72727273** and **0.84210526**, and accounting for the triple bond, a reasonable prediction is:

**0.76923077** (approximately midway between the two closest examples). 

This reflects the balance between the complexity/unsaturation and the stabilizing influence of the hydroxyl groups and symmetric core.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.5517241379310345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular flexibility, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups (e.g., aliphatic chains, hydroxyl groups, ethers, and carbonyls). Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~1.0 or close):**
   - Molecules with flexible aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`, `CCCCCC(C)O`, `CCSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C`).
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl or ether groups (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br`).
   - Lack of rigid aromatic systems or bulky substituents.

2. **Low Property Values (~0.0 or close):**
   - Rigid aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`).
   - Molecules with heavy halogenation or planar heterocycles (e.g., `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F`).

3. **Intermediate Values (0.1–0.5):**
   - Molecules with a mix of flexible and rigid features (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N`, `COc1ccccc1Cl`).
   - Presence of both aromatic and aliphatic components.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
- **Structural Features:**
   - Multiple ether linkages (`OCO`, `OC`, `COC`).
   - Several hydroxyl groups (`OH` or `O` attached to carbons).
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...`) but not heavily substituted or rigidified.
   - Flexible aliphatic chains and cyclic systems (e.g., `C6C2C(COC2=O)...`).
   - No heavy halogenation or planar constraints.

- **Comparison to Examples:**
   - Similar to molecules like `CCCCOCCO` (property = 1.0) or `CCCCCC(C)O` (property = 1.0) due to high flexibility and oxygen-rich groups.
   - More flexible than intermediate examples like `COc1ccccc1Cl` (property = 0.14285714), so the value should be higher.
   - No rigidifying features to lower the value significantly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the high flexibility, abundance of ether/hydroxyl groups, and lack of rigid constraints, the property value is likely close to **1.0**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.92592593**  
*(This matches the trend of highly flexible, oxygen-rich molecules in the examples, such as `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` with a value of 0.92592593.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and molecular characteristics. Here are some observations:

1. **Aromatic compounds with halogens (Cl, Br, I) and/or nitro groups (NO2) tend to have a property value of 0.0**:
   - Examples: `Clc1ccccc1I` (0.0), `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (0.0), `Fc1ccccc1` (0.0), `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (0.0), `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (0.0).

2. **Compounds with hydroxyl (-OH) or ether (-O-) groups and no other strongly deactivating groups (like NO2 or multiple halogens) often have higher property values**:
   - Examples: `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O` (1.0), `CC(C)CCO` (1.0), `CCCCCCCCO` (1.0).

3. **The molecule `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is chlorophenol**, which has:
   - An aromatic ring with a hydroxyl (-OH) group (which would typically increase the property value).
   - A chlorine substituent (which, based on the examples, tends to reduce the property value to 0.0 when combined with other halogens or nitro groups, but not necessarily alone).

4. **Similar molecules**:
   - `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrophenol) has a property value of 0.0 (due to the nitro group).
   - `Fc1ccccc1` (fluorobenzene with no hydroxyl) has 0.0.
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (another nitrophenol) has 0.0.
   - However, `Oc1ccccc1` (phenol, no halogen) is not in the examples, but hydroxyl alone seems to favor higher values.

Given that `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has only one chlorine and no other strongly deactivating groups, but chlorine is still a deactivating substituent, the property value is likely **0.0**, similar to other halogenated aromatics in the dataset.

### Predicted property value: 0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.18181818181818182
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (1.0 or close):**
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCC`, `CC(C)C(C)O`, `CCCO`).
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (e.g., `BrC(Br)(Br)Br`, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`).
   - Molecules with no aromatic rings or conjugated systems.

2. **Low Property Values (0.0 or close):**
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`).
   - Molecules with conjugated systems or polar groups (e.g., `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F`).
   - Molecules with heterocycles or extended conjugation (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23`).

3. **Intermediate Property Values (0.1 to 0.5):**
   - Molecules with a mix of aliphatic and aromatic components (e.g., `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` → 0.333, `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` → 0.2).
   - Molecules with polar groups attached to aromatic rings (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1` → 0.14285714).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**. Its structure includes:
- An aliphatic chain with a triple bond (`ClCC#CCO`).
- An ester group (`OC(=O)N`).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (`c1cccc(Cl)c1`).

### Key Features:
1. The presence of an aromatic ring (low property value tendency).
2. The aliphatic chain with a triple bond and ester group (could increase the property value slightly).
3. Chlorine substituents (can increase the property value, as seen in some examples).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (aromatic + ester) → 0.2.
- `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (aromatic + amide + ether) → 0.3.
- `CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (aromatic + ester + aliphatic chain) → 0.36363636.

The target molecule has a similar structure to these examples but with a triple bond and additional chlorine. The triple bond is not present in the examples, but it is likely to behave similarly to an aliphatic chain, slightly increasing the property value. The chlorines may also contribute to a higher value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.4**. A reasonable estimate is **0.33333333** (similar to `CCc1ccc(C)cc1`).

### Final Answer:
**0.33333333**

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.058823529411764705
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to be a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0, likely representing some form of "fractional property" (e.g., solubility, reactivity, or a specific functional group contribution).

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: Often seen in symmetric, aromatic, or highly halogenated molecules with no flexible/aliphatic chains (e.g., `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br`).
2. **Property = 1.0**: Seen in fully aliphatic or flexible chains (e.g., `CCCBr`, `CC(C)C(C)C`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
3. **Intermediate values**: Occur when there is a mix of aromatic and aliphatic components or polar functional groups (e.g., `COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C` has 0.3478).

### Analysis of the given molecule:
- **Structure**: `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`
  - Central oxygen with three substituents:
    1. A phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1`).
    2. A pyrimidine-like ring (`c2cncnc2`).
    3. Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent (`c3ccccc3Cl`).
  - No flexible aliphatic chains; rigid and aromatic-dominated.
  - Two chlorine atoms and a heterocyclic ring introduce polarity but no aliphatic flexibility.

### Comparison to examples:
- Similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (property = 0.1429), which has multiple aromatic rings and chlorine substituents.
- Also resembles `ClC2=C(Cl)C3(Cl)C1C=CCC1C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl` (property = 0.6), but our molecule lacks aliphatic flexibility.
- The presence of the pyrimidine ring (`c2cncnc2`) might slightly increase the property compared to pure aromatic systems, but the rigidity dominates.

### Predicted property:
Given the rigidity, aromaticity, and lack of aliphatic components, the property is likely **low but not zero**. A reasonable estimate is **0.1333** (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2`, which has mixed aromatic/polar features).

### Final answer:
**0.1333**
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.8
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes or alkyl chains** (e.g., CCCCBr, CCCCCCCCC(=O)C, C1CCCCCCC1) tend to have high property values (1.0 or close to it).
2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups** (e.g., NO2, COOH, CO, OH, halogens) tend to have lower property values, especially if they introduce significant polarity or hydrogen bonding.
3. **Aromatic systems** (e.g., benzene rings) often reduce the property value, especially if substituted with polar groups.
4. **Molecules with esters or aldehydes** (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC, CCCCCC=O) tend to have intermediate values (~0.833).

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O**:
- This is a linear molecule with an **alkyl chain (CCCC)** and an **ester-like group (OC=O)**. The OC=O group is an aldehyde (formyl group) attached to an oxygen, making it a formate ester (HCOOR).
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (butyl acetate): property = 0.833.
  - **CCCCC=O** (hexanal): property = 0.833.
  - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...** (complex ester): property = 0.68.
- The formate ester (OC=O) is slightly more polar than a simple aldehyde or ketone but less polar than a carboxylic acid. The alkyl chain (CCCC) is nonpolar and contributes to a higher property value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (0.833) and **CCCCC=O** (0.833), and considering the slightly higher polarity of the formate group, the property value for **CCCCOC=O** is likely slightly lower than 0.833 but still in the same range. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.8** (rounded from ~0.8 to account for the formate group's polarity). 

However, since the examples with similar structures (CCCC(=O)OCC and CCCCC=O) both have 0.833, and the formate group is not drastically more polar, the value is likely very close to 0.833. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.83333333** (same as the similar examples). 

### Final Answer:
**0.83333333**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value tends to be **1.0** for simple, small, and fully saturated molecules without significant functional groups or aromaticity. Examples include:

- `CCCC` (butane) → 1.0
- `CCBr` (ethyl bromide) → 1.0
- `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane) → 1.0
- `CC(C)(C)CCO` (tert-butanol derivative) → 1.0
- `CCCCCCCCBr` (octyl bromide) → 1.0

The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is structurally similar to `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane), which has a property value of 1.0. Both are small, fully saturated, and contain halogens without additional functional groups or unsaturation. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `ClCCl` is:  
**1.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH):**
   - Molecules with a free -OH group (not part of a larger functional group like carboxylic acid or ester) often have property values of **0.0** or **0.14285714** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` = 0.0, `c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2` = 0.14285714).
   - However, if the -OH is part of a more complex or hindered structure, the value may be higher (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` = 0.4).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents:**
   - Simple aromatic rings with -OH or -O- tend to have low property values (e.g., `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = 0.0, `Brc1ccccc1` = 0.0).
   - If the aromatic ring has alkyl substituents (like -CH3), the value may increase slightly (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` = 0.4).

3. **Molecule in Question: Cc1cccc(C)c1O**
   - This is a toluene derivative with a methyl group (-CH3) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the aromatic ring.
   - Structurally similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (property = 0.4), but with one fewer methyl group.
   - The -OH is not sterically hindered, and the molecule is relatively simple.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of -OH and the simplicity of the aromatic system, the property value is likely **low**. The closest analog is `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (0.4), but with fewer alkyl groups, the value might be slightly lower. 

A reasonable prediction is **0.25**, as this aligns with other simple aromatic -OH compounds and accounts for the slight increase due to the methyl group.

### Final Answer:
**0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, I observe the following patterns:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings tend to have a property value of 0.0 (e.g., Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, etc.).

2. The given molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl derivative with chlorine atoms on both aromatic rings, similar to the examples that have property values of 0.0.

3. There are no counterexamples where polychlorinated aromatic compounds have non-zero property values in the provided data.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to the zero-valued examples and the consistent pattern observed for polychlorinated aromatic systems, I predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl to be:

0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Fully saturated hydrocarbons (no functional groups, no rings, no double/triple bonds except terminal alkenes)**:
   - **CC(C)(C)C** (neopentane): Property = 1.0
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = 1.0
   - These molecules have no polar or aromatic features and are purely hydrophobic, leading to the highest property value (1.0).

2. **Molecules with one terminal double bond**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (2-ethylhexanal): Property = 0.875
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1-nonene): Property = 0.8
   - The presence of a terminal double bond reduces the property slightly compared to fully saturated hydrocarbons, but it remains high.

3. **Molecules with internal double bonds or branching**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene) is structurally similar to the above examples but with a more central double bond and branching.
   - Branching and internal unsaturation tend to reduce the property further compared to terminal alkenes or saturated hydrocarbons.

4. **Other trends**:
   - Aromatic rings, polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO), or halogens drastically reduce the property (often to 0 or near 0).
   - Simple alkenes without additional functional groups retain moderately high values.

### Prediction for CC=C(C)C:
- This is a branched alkene with an internal double bond. It lacks polar or aromatic features, so the property should still be relatively high but lower than fully saturated or terminal alkene examples.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1-nonene, terminal alkene): 0.8
  - **CC=C(C)C** is more branched and has an internal double bond, which likely reduces the property further.
  - A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than 0.8, perhaps **0.75**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC=C(C)C** is **0.75**.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (especially chlorine) aromatic or aliphatic molecules** tend to have **low or zero property values**:
   - Examples: 
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` → 0.0
     - `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → 0.0
     - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) → 0.0
     - `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` → 0.0
   - These molecules are heavily chlorinated and often have property values of **0.0**.

2. **Small aliphatic chlorinated molecules** also follow this trend:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) → 0.0
   - `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is structurally similar—a small, fully chlorinated aliphatic compound.

3. **Non-chlorinated or less chlorinated flexible/aliphatic molecules** tend to have **higher values (e.g., 1.0 or close)**:
   - Examples: 
     - `CCCC(C)(C)CO` → 1.0
     - `CC(C)C(C)O` → 1.0
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 1.0

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- **ClCCl** is a small, fully chlorinated aliphatic molecule (similar to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, which has a value of 0.0).
- No examples of small chlorinated aliphatics deviate from the 0.0 trend.
- Thus, the predicted property value is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to the examples to predict the property.

**Molecule to predict:** Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl

This is a chlorinated phenol derivative with three chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring (specifically, it's 2,4,6-trichlorophenol). 

Looking at the examples, we can see a few similar chlorinated aromatic compounds:
1. `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (property = 0.0) - This is very similar to our molecule, just with a slightly different chlorine substitution pattern (likely 2,4,5-trichlorophenol).
2. `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` (property = 0.0) - A fully brominated benzene ring.
3. `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (property = 0.0) - A biphenyl structure.

All these aromatic compounds with multiple halogen substitutions or extended conjugation have a property value of 0.0. 

The only chlorinated phenol in the examples (`Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl`) has a value of 0.0, and our molecule is nearly identical in structure and substitution pattern.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with the presence or absence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H) or simple alcohols/ethers** tend to have a property value of **1.0** (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CO`, `CC1CCCC1`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
2. **Molecules with polar or reactive functional groups** (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, carbonyls `C=O`, halogens, heterocycles, or conjugated systems) tend to have **lower values**, often **0.0** or fractional values (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` → 0.333, `Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` → 0.0).
3. **Complex molecules with a mix of hydrocarbon and polar groups** tend to have **intermediate values** (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` → 0.809, `O=c2[nH]c1CCCc1c(=O)n2C3CCCCC3` → 0.692).
4. **Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, cyano) often have **0.0** (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` → 0.0, `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → 0.0).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Key features:
1. **Multiple ether linkages (`OCH3`, `OCO`) and hydroxyl groups (`OH`)** – these are polar but not as strongly deactivating as nitro or carbonyl groups.
2. **Aromatic rings with methoxy substitutions** – these are electron-donating, not electron-withdrawing.
3. **A carbonyl group (`C=O`)** – this is a polar feature that may reduce the property value.
4. **Fused ring systems and sugar-like moieties** – these add complexity but are not strongly deactivating.
5. **No strongly electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., no nitro, cyano, or sulfonyl groups).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles **complex sugar-like structures** (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` → 1.0) but with additional aromatic and carbonyl features.
- The presence of the carbonyl group and fused rings may reduce the value slightly, but the lack of strongly deactivating groups suggests it won't drop to 0.0.
- Similar examples with mixed features (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` → 0.809) suggest a **high fractional value**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the molecule likely has a **high fractional property value**, similar to other complex molecules with carbonyls and ethers but no strongly deactivating groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.75** (or in the range 0.7–0.8, based on comparable examples). 

This balances the hydrocarbon-like regions (pushing toward 1.0) with the polar carbonyl and ether groups (reducing the value slightly).

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.625
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like ring** (with N and C=O groups). This is somewhat similar to the structure **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C**, which has a property value of **0.7**.
   - Both molecules have:
     - A heterocyclic ring with N and S atoms.
     - A tertiary butyl group (**C(C)(C)C**).
     - A carbonyl group (**C=O**).
     - An amide-like nitrogen (**N**).

2. **Key Differences**:
   - The given molecule has a **thioether (CS)** group instead of a **thione (C=S)** in the reference molecule.
   - The reference molecule has an additional **hydroxy (OH)** group, which might increase its property value.

3. **Other Comparisons**:
   - Molecules with **tertiary butyl groups** and **heterocyclic rings** tend to have higher property values (e.g., **0.7** in the reference above).
   - Molecules with **simple aromatic rings** or **halogens** tend to have lower values (often **0.0**).
   - The presence of **C=O** and **N** in the ring suggests moderate polarity, which might align with intermediate values.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.7)** but with a slightly less polar **thioether (CS)** instead of **thione (C=S)**, the property value is likely slightly lower. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.6**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the given data.)

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.2222222222222222
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) tend to have high property values (e.g., **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has a value of **1.0**, **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** has **1.0**).
   - Ethers (**-O-**) and esters (**-COO-**) often have intermediate to high values, especially if they are part of a flexible aliphatic chain (e.g., **CCCCCC(=O)OC** has **0.85714286**, **CCCCC(=O)OCC** has **0.85714286**).

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Pure aromatic systems (e.g., **o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, **Nc1ccccc1**) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they are substituted with polar or hydrogen-bonding groups.
   - Aromatic rings with ester or other polar substituents can have intermediate values (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** has **0.2**).

3. **Hybrid Structures**:
   - Molecules with both aliphatic and aromatic components (e.g., **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** has **0.09090909**, **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has **0.14285714**) tend to have low to intermediate values, depending on the polarity of the substituents.

### Analysis of **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
- This is **ethyl benzoate**, consisting of:
  - An aromatic ring (**c1ccccc1**).
  - An ester group (**-COO-** attached to the aromatic ring and an ethyl group (**CCO-**).
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (more complex, with additional polar groups) has a value of **0.2**.
  - **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (aliphatic ester) has **0.85714286**.
  - **CCCCC(=O)OCC** (aliphatic ester) has **0.85714286**.
- The aromatic ring reduces the property value compared to purely aliphatic esters, but the ester group still contributes some polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the presence of the ester group (which is polar but not as strongly hydrogen-bonding as hydroxyl groups) and the aromatic ring (which tends to lower the value), the property value is likely **intermediate**. 

A reasonable estimate is **0.8**, but looking at the examples, aromatic esters with simple substituents are not directly listed. The closest analog is the more complex **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)...** with **0.2**, but this is likely lower due to the additional bulky/polar groups. For **ethyl benzoate**, a higher value is expected due to the simpler, more flexible ester. 

Given that **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (aliphatic ester) is **0.857**, and the aromatic ring reduces this somewhat, a plausible prediction is **0.75**. However, to match the precision of the given examples, let's round to a fraction like **0.8** or **0.75**. 

But looking back, the values are often fractions with denominators like 7, 9, 11, etc. (e.g., 0.857 = 6/7, 0.714 = 5/7). For consistency, let's pick a fraction like **5/7 ≈ 0.714** or **6/7 ≈ 0.857**. Since the aromatic ring reduces the value slightly from **0.857**, **0.714** seems reasonable.

However, the exact pattern isn't perfectly clear, so I'll go with **0.71428571** (5/7), matching the **CCCC/C=C/C** example, which is also a somewhat polar but not highly functionalized molecule.

### Final Answer:
**0.71428571**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes with Terminal Functional Groups:**
   - **CI (iodomethane):** Property = 1.0
   - **CCCCCCCO (1-heptanol):** Property = 1.0
   - **CCN(=O)=O (nitroethane):** Property = 1.0
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO (glycerol):** Property = 1.0
   - **CSSC (disulfides like dimethyl disulfide):** Property = 1.0
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC (organophosphate with sulfur):** Property = 1.0

   These molecules have terminal polar or reactive functional groups (e.g., -OH, -I, -NO2, -SS-, -S-) and tend to have property values of **1.0**.

2. **Halogenated Alkanes:**
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O:** Property = 0.6
   - **CC(C)N(C(C)C)C(=O)SCC(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl:** Property = 0.7
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl:** Property = 0.0 (aromatic chlorides)
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (brominated aromatic):** Property = 0.0

   Aliphatic halogenated compounds (e.g., with -Cl or -Br) seem to have intermediate values unless they are aromatic (which tend to be 0.0).

3. **Brominated Alkanes:**
   - The only direct example is **CI (iodomethane)** with property = 1.0, but bromine is less polarizable than iodine. 
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear alkyl bromide, similar to **CCCCCCCO (1-heptanol)**, which has property = 1.0. The terminal -Br is a good leaving group and polar, akin to -OH or -I.

4. **Long Hydrocarbon Chains:**
   - **CCCCCCC=C (1-heptene):** Property = 0.75
   - **CCCCCCCO (1-heptanol):** Property = 1.0
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is structurally similar to these, with -Br being more polar than a double bond but less polar than -OH.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Terminal polar groups (e.g., -OH, -I, -NO2) give property = 1.0.
- Bromine is less polar than iodine but still a good leaving group (similar to -OH in reactivity trends).
- No examples of simple alkyl bromides are given, but **CCCCCCCO (1-heptanol)** is a close analog with property = 1.0.

Thus, **CCCCCCCBr (1-bromoheptane)** is likely to have a property value close to **1.0**, similar to other terminal polar groups.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **1.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional groups. The molecule **CO (carbon monoxide)** is a small, linear molecule with a polar covalent bond (C≡O), but it lacks hydrogen atoms or other functional groups that could participate in hydrogen bonding or significant interactions like hydroxyl (-OH) or amine (-NH) groups.

Looking at the examples:
- Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC**, **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O**) often have high property values (1.0 or close), especially if they contain hydroxyl groups.
- Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**), aromatic rings without polar substituents, or highly halogenated structures (e.g., **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**) tend to have low or zero property values.
- **CO** is somewhat analogous to **CCC** or **CC#C** (small, non-complex molecules), but its polarity might reduce the property value compared to purely hydrophobic alkanes.

Given the lack of hydrogen-bonding donors/acceptors beyond the weak dipole of CO, and comparing to similar small molecules in the dataset (e.g., **CC#C** has 0.333), I predict the property value for **CO** to be:

**0.5** (intermediate between small hydrocarbons and polar/non-interacting molecules). 

However, if the property is specifically tied to hydrogen-bonding or solubility-like features, CO's lack of H-bonding might push it lower. Given the examples, I lean toward **0.5** as a reasonable estimate. 

(Note: If the property is something like "hydrogen-bond donor count," CO would score 0, but the examples suggest a more complex metric. Given the ambiguity, 0.5 is a plausible midpoint.) 

Final answer: **0.5**
