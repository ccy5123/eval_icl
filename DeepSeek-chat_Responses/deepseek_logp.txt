SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 3.3001000000000023
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, I can predict the property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structure Analysis**: The molecule is a long-chain aliphatic ester with a **C10 chain (CCCCCCCCC)** and a **methyl ester group (C(=O)OC)**. 

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (given in the dataset) has a property value of **4.0803**. This is a **C12 chain with a methyl ester** (similar but slightly longer).
   - **CCCCCC(=O)C** (a shorter ketone) has a value of **2.5458**.
   - **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (a long-chain alcohol) has a value of **2.7277**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **3.2227**.

3. **Trends Observed**:
   - Longer carbon chains generally increase the property value.
   - Polar functional groups (like esters) tend to have higher values than pure hydrocarbons but lower than highly halogenated or aromatic systems.
   - The ester group in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is similar to the one in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (4.0803)**, but with a slightly shorter chain.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Since **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (C12 ester) is **4.0803**, the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (C10 ester) should have a **slightly lower value** due to the shorter chain.
   - A reasonable estimate would be **~3.8 to 4.0**.

However, looking back at the dataset, **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is explicitly listed with a value of **4.0803**, which matches the given molecule's structure. 

### Final Predicted Property Value: **4.0803** (same as the identical molecule in the dataset). 

(Note: If this was a typo and the query molecule is shorter, e.g., **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, the value would likely be closer to **~3.5** based on interpolation.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 1.7744999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** scaffold (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl group and NH). This is a polar, heterocyclic system with potential hydrogen-bonding (NH and C=O) and aromaticity.
2. **Substituent**: A **chlorine atom** is attached to the benzene ring, which increases lipophilicity (log P contribution ~0.7–1.0, depending on position).
3. **Polarity**: The NH and C=O groups introduce polarity, which would typically lower log P, but the aromatic system and chlorine counterbalance this.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Cl-containing aromatic systems**: 
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (5.9672) and `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (5.929) have high values due to multiple Cl atoms and large aromatic systems.
  - `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4.6592) has high Cl count but polar OH, reducing log P slightly.
- **Heterocycles with polar groups**: 
  - `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (0.1343) is very polar (low log P).
  - `c1cncnc1` (0.4766) is a polar heterocycle with no Cl.
- **Chlorinated + polar**: 
  - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (2.699) has two Cl atoms and one OH, giving intermediate log P.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of **one Cl** and **polar NH/C=O** suggests a balance between lipophilicity and polarity.
- The fused aromatic system adds ~2.0–3.0 to log P, while the polar groups subtract ~1.0–1.5.
- Chlorine adds ~0.7–1.0.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** likely has a **log P in the range of 1.5–2.5**. A reasonable estimate is **~2.1**, considering:
- Similar to `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (2.699) but with one fewer Cl and an additional polar NH group.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.1** (estimated log P).

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6715
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups** (e.g., nitro, nitroso, amide, etc.) often lower the property value, especially when polar or charged. For example:
   - `Nc1nccs1` (thiazole amine) has a low value of **0.7253**.
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (fluorinated pyrimidone) has a negative value of **-0.5088**.
   - `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` (cyclic urea) has a very low value of **-2.1798**.

2. **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** specifically appear to reduce the property value significantly. For example:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (nitroimidazole) has a very low value of **0.09202**.

3. **Alkyl groups** (e.g., `CC`, `CCC`) tend to increase the property value modestly unless counteracted by polar groups. For example:
   - `CCC(C)CC` (branched alkane) has a value of **2.4425**.
   - `CCCOCC` (ether) has a value of **1.4329**.

### Analysis of **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
- The molecule has a **nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)** attached to an isopropyl group (`CC(C)`).
- The nitro group is highly polar and likely dominates the property value, pulling it downward.
- The isopropyl group is a small alkyl substituent, which may slightly offset the nitro group's effect but not enough to raise the value significantly.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (nitroimidazole) has a value of **0.09202**.
- `NC(=O)CCl` (chloroacetamide) has a value of **-0.2895**.
- `CCCCCl` (chlorobutane) has a value of **2.0253**.

Given that **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler than the nitroimidazole but still has a nitro group, its value should be slightly higher than the nitroimidazole but lower than typical alkyl halides. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.5**, considering the balance between the nitro group's strong polar effect and the small alkyl group's modest contribution.

However, looking more closely, the nitro group's impact is stronger, so a value closer to **0.1 - 0.3** might be more accurate. Given the example of `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (0.09202), which has additional heterocyclic complexity, **CC(C)N(=O)=O** might be slightly higher due to its simpler structure.

### Final Prediction:
**0.25** (approximate, based on trends). 

If forced to pick a specific value from the given examples' range, I would lean toward **0.25**, but the closest match in behavior suggests **~0.1**. 

For precision, I'll predict:  
**0.15** (reflecting the nitro group's dominant effect). 

However, since the examples with nitro groups are around **0.09202**, and this is a simpler nitroalkane, a slight increase is plausible. 

### Adjusted Final Answer:  
**0.20** (interpolating between the nitroimidazole and simpler nitroalkane trends). 

But to align with the given examples' granularity, I'll round to:  
**0.25**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trend of nitro groups reducing the value significantly.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 2.666700000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Molecular Complexity**: The molecule is a steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (tetracyclic framework), similar to the example **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**, which has a property value of **4.7235**. This suggests that complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values (often in the range of 4-5).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O) groups**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (one in a ring and one as a terminal aldehyde), which can increase the property value.
   - **Hydroxyl (OH) group**: Polar but not as impactful as carbonyls in this context.
   - **Size and rigidity**: The fused ring system contributes significantly to the property value due to its bulk and hydrophobicity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = 4.7235), which is also a steroid-like molecule with two carbonyls. The given molecule has an additional hydroxyl group and a slightly more polar side chain (CH2OH), which may slightly increase the property value due to enhanced polarity.

4. **Trends**:
   - Simple alkanes/ethers have low values (~1-2).
   - Aromatic systems with halogens or nitro groups range from ~2-4.
   - Polycyclic systems (especially with carbonyls) tend to be >4.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (4.7235) but with slightly higher polarity due to the OH and CH2OH groups, the predicted value would be **~4.9**.

### Final Answer:
**4.9** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trends observed in the examples).

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 3.5801000000000016
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a value of **2.9934**.
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene) has a value of **2.7054**.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of **3.4932**.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule has two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), which are polar and can influence the property.
   - Example: **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (thiourea derivative) has a value of **1.3421**.
   - Example: **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** (hydrazide) has a value of **-0.3149**.

3. **Halogen Substituents**:
   - Fluorine and chlorine atoms are present, which can increase the property value due to their electronegativity and size.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has **2.9934**.
   - Example: **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (trichlorophenol) has **3.3524**.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is larger than simple mono- or di-substituted benzenes but smaller than polycyclic systems like naphthalene.
   - Example: **Cc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylmethane-like) has **3.66202**.
   - Example: **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (polycyclic) has **4.411**.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The presence of two aromatic rings with halogens and polar amide groups suggests a value higher than simple halogenated benzenes (~3.0) but lower than large polycyclic systems (~4.5).
- The amide groups may slightly reduce the property compared to pure halogenated aromatics, but the fluorine and chlorine substituents counterbalance this.
- A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **3.2 to 3.6**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above factors, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is:

**3.45** (approximate, based on structural analogies). 

This is consistent with the trends observed in the given examples for similar-sized molecules with halogen and polar functional group contributions.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.8214000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl ethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether groups tend to have moderate property values, often between **1.0 and 2.5**.
   - Example: **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl acetate) has a value of **0.9595**, but this also includes an ester group.
   - Example: **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate) has a value of **2.204**.
   - Example: **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol) has a value of **1.4008**.

2. **Branching/Alkyl Groups**:
   - Branching tends to increase the property value slightly compared to linear chains.
   - Example: **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol) has a value of **1.8034**.
   - Example: **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **3.4687**.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Non-Polar Molecules**:
   - Molecules like **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl ethyl ether) are relatively non-polar but have an oxygen linker, which may slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCO** (1-propanol) is not in the dataset, but **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) has a value of **1.1689**.
   - **CCC(C)(O)CC** (a branched alcohol) has a value of **1.9475**.
   - Ethers like **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl acetate) have lower values, but **CCCOC(C)C** is simpler and less polar.

### Prediction for **CCCOC(C)C**:
- The molecule is a simple ether with branching (isopropyl group) and a short alkyl chain (ethyl group).
- Given the trends, the property value is likely in the range of **1.4 to 1.8**.
- Comparing to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (1.8034) and **COc1ccccc1O** (1.4008), I would expect a value slightly lower than **1.8034** but higher than **1.4008** due to the lack of aromaticity or additional polar groups.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is approximately **1.65**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being measured, such as logP, solubility, or another descriptor.)

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1.5785200000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (uracil-like) core** with substitutions:
   - A **bromine (Br)** substituent (electron-withdrawing, increases polarity).
   - A **tert-butyl-like group (CCC(C))** attached to nitrogen (bulky, hydrophobic).
   - Two **carbonyl (C=O) groups** (polar, hydrogen-bond acceptors).
   - A **methyl (C)** substituent (moderate hydrophobicity).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Bromine and carbonyl groups will increase the property value (likely related to **logP or a similar hydrophobicity metric**) compared to purely aliphatic molecules.
   - The bulky alkyl group (CCC(C)) adds hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar Br and C=O groups.
   - Similar molecules in the examples with Br/Cl and polar groups (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, 2.9934; CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 2.4075) have values in the **2.4–3.0 range**.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (2.4075)**: Contains Br and polar amide, similar to our molecule.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (2.9934)**: Two chlorines (less polar than Br but similar effect).
   - **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3 (3.5752)**: Polyaromatic with polar NH, but more hydrophobic.
   - Our molecule has **more polar groups (2 C=O, Br)** but also a **bulky alkyl group**, so it should be **higher than 2.4075 but lower than 3.5752**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar (Br, C=O) and hydrophobic (CCC(C), methyl) groups, the predicted value is likely **~2.65**.

**Final Answer**: **2.65** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 3.353600000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to molecular structure and the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values in the range of **~2.5 to ~4.5**, depending on substitutions and conjugation.
   - For example:
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a high value of **6.9192** due to extensive conjugation and size.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system) has a value of **4.7284**.
     - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative) has a value of **3.45664**.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which allows for some conjugation but not as extensive as fused systems.
   - Compared to naphthalene (fused rings), biphenyl is less conjugated, so its value should be slightly lower than naphthalene derivatives but higher than simple benzene rings.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a benzene ring with a cyclohexane substituent) has a value of **2.5654**.
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **3.45664**.
   - Biphenyl is intermediate in conjugation between these two, so a reasonable estimate would be **~3.0 to ~3.5**.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2)** is likely close to **3.0**. 

Looking at the examples, **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (less conjugated) is **2.5654**, and **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (more conjugated) is **3.45664**. Biphenyl's conjugation is between these, so a good estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.1** (approximately). 

However, since the examples show that fused systems (like naphthalene) are ~3.45 and simpler systems are ~2.5, biphenyl would likely be **~3.0 to 3.2**. 

Given the data, I predict:  
**3.1** (or more precisely, **3.0** to align with similar examples). 

But for specificity, let's say **3.1**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** is **2.5654**, and biphenyl is more conjugated, so **~3.0** seems reasonable. 

Final answer: **3.0**. 

But to be more precise, given the trends, I'll refine to **3.1**. 

However, looking at **CC(C)c1ccccc1C** (a toluene derivative with branching), which is **3.11842**, biphenyl (more conjugated) should be slightly higher. 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**3.2**. 

But to match the closest example, **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** is **3.45664**, and biphenyl is less conjugated, so **3.2** is reasonable. 

Final prediction: **3.2**. 

However, the simplest aromatic systems (like **CCCCCCC**, alkanes) are ~2.9-3.0, and biphenyl is more conjugated, so **3.2** is a safe estimate. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is **3.2**.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.7163
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to molecular structure and the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length**: 
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (7 carbons): 3.2227  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with propyl substituent): 2.9767  
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (5 carbons with a double bond): 2.3626  
   - **CC(C)I** (3 carbons with iodine): 1.8298  
   - **CC1CO1** (3 carbons with an epoxy group): 0.4051  

   Longer hydrocarbon chains generally have higher property values, while polar or functional groups reduce the value.

2. **Sulfur-Containing Compounds**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**: 0.8517 (complex thiophosphate)  
   - **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1**: 0.74091 (thioamide)  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 1.4455 (ester with nitrogen)  

   Sulfur atoms tend to moderately increase the property value compared to oxygen or nitrogen analogs, but the exact effect depends on the molecular context.

3. **Simple Alkanes vs. Functionalized Alkanes**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C**: 2.3626  
   - **CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O)**: 2.878 (unsaturated ketone)  
   - **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 1.8356 (ester with aromatic amine)  

   The property decreases with polar functional groups (e.g., OH, CO, NH) and increases with nonpolar hydrocarbon character.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- **CCCCS** is a 4-carbon thiol (butyl mercaptan). 
- Compared to **CCCC(=C)C** (2.3626), the sulfur atom in **CCCCS** is less polar than a double bond but adds some molecular weight and polarizability. 
- Thiols are less polar than alcohols or amines, so the property value should be higher than for an alcohol (e.g., **CC(C)(C)CO** would likely be lower). 
- From the examples, **CC(C)I** (3 carbons + iodine) is 1.8298, and **CCCC(=C)C** (5 carbons + double bond) is 2.3626. A 4-carbon thiol should fall between these, closer to the latter because sulfur is less polar than iodine.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCS** is **~2.1**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCC_S: 2.1** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.8050000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Influence**: The property values appear to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity. Higher values indicate greater hydrophobicity.
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** = 2.4425) have moderate values.
   - Branching reduces hydrophobicity slightly (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)O** = 1.4133).
   - Polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-CO**) decrease the value significantly (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C** = 0.0443).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **-OH groups**: Reduce the property value (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)O** = 1.4133, **CCCC(C)(O)CC** = 1.9475).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)**: Increase the value (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl** = 1.9864, **BrC(Br)Br** = 2.4547).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Increase hydrophobicity (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1** = 2.34).

3. **Structure of CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - The molecule is a branched alkane (**5 carbons in the main chain, 2 methyl branches, and a terminal -OH**).
   - Similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = 1.9475) but with one less carbon and a primary -OH instead of a tertiary -OH.
   - The -OH group will reduce the value compared to pure alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** = 2.4425).

### Prediction:
Given the structure:
- The branching and -OH group will lower the value compared to linear or non-polar analogs.
- A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (1.9475) due to the primary -OH being more polar than a tertiary -OH.

**Predicted property value: ~1.85**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trend of -OH reducing the value by ~0.5–1.0 compared to analogous hydrocarbons.)*  

### Final Answer:
**1.85**

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **1.6866**.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (1,2-dimethylbenzene) has a value of **2.61186**.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) also has a value of **2.61186**, suggesting that additional methyl groups on a benzene ring may not always increase the property significantly if the substitution pattern is similar.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** (toluene with one additional methyl) has a value of **2.30344**.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a naphthalene derivative with a methyl group) has a value of **4.30142**.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (a methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **3.45664**.
   - The molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a very high value of **8.5808**, but this is likely due to the heavy halogen substitution.

3. **Target Molecule: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
   - This is **methylnaphthalene** (a naphthalene ring with one methyl group).
   - Comparing to the examples:
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (4.30142) is a more substituted naphthalene, so its value is higher.
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (3.45664) is a dimethylnaphthalene, so the mono-methyl version should be lower.
     - The base naphthalene (**c1ccc2ccccc2c1**) is not in the examples, but benzene is 1.6866, and adding a methyl to benzene (toluene) increases it to ~2.30344. Extending this to naphthalene, the base value is likely higher than benzene, and adding a methyl group would further increase it.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Methylbenzene (toluene) is ~2.30344, and methylnaphthalene should be higher due to the larger aromatic system.
- The dimethylnaphthalene example is 3.45664, so the mono-methyl version should be slightly lower.

A reasonable estimate for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (methylnaphthalene) is **~3.0**. Looking at the examples, the closest match is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (3.45664), but since this is dimethylnaphthalene, the mono-methyl version would likely be slightly lower. 

However, another similar molecule is **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1C** (not in the examples, but analogous to the dimethyl case), which would be higher. Since the given molecule is mono-methyl, a good estimate is **~3.2**.

But reviewing the examples again, **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** is 3.45664, and **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is less substituted, so likely **~3.1 to 3.3**.

Given the data, the most precise estimate is **3.2**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **3.2**. 

(Note: If more precise interpolation is needed, a value of **3.25** could also be reasonable, but based on the examples, **3.2** is a solid estimate.)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 1.3510999999999993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogens. This is similar to the example:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **-0.0652**).

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **C(C)CCC** group (a branched alkyl chain) and a **CC=C** group (an alkenyl side chain). 
   - Compared to the example above, this molecule has a **longer/bulkier alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC)** instead of just a methyl group (**C**). 

3. **Impact of Substituents**:
   - The **CC=C** group is identical to the example, which likely contributes similarly to the property.
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is more hydrophobic and larger than a methyl group, which would typically **increase the property value slightly** compared to the example (where the property was -0.0652).

4. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - Molecules with **cyclic ureas/hydantoins** and **alkyl/alkenyl substituents** tend to have property values in the **low to moderate range** (e.g., -0.0652 to ~2.0).
   - The addition of a **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** would likely increase the value modestly compared to the methyl-substituted example.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (-0.0652)** but with a bulkier substituent, the property should be **higher but still in a similar range**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**~0.5 to 1.0**.  

Looking at other examples with similar features (e.g., **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2, 4.6046** has alkenes and aromatic rings, but our molecule lacks aromatics), a conservative prediction is:  
**0.85**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.85**.  

*(This is based on the structural similarity to the example with property -0.0652, adjusted upward due to the larger alkyl substituent.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.705400000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to the property (which appears to be **logP**, the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient, a measure of hydrophobicity). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings)** increase logP.  
   - Example: `CCCCC` (pentane) has logP = 2.1965.  
   - Benzene derivatives with non-polar substituents (e.g., `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1`, logP = 2.8114) have higher logP.  

2. **Polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -Cl, -F, -N, -S=O)** decrease logP.  
   - Example: `CCO` (ethanol) has logP = -0.0014 due to the -OH group.  
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to moderately increase logP but less than alkyl groups.  
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has logP = 2.9446.  

3. **Fluorine substituents** are unique:  
   - Fluorine is highly electronegative but also small, so its effect on logP is less predictable.  
   - Perfluorinated groups (e.g., -CF3) are strongly hydrophobic despite the polarity of C-F bonds.  

### Analysis of **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**:
- The molecule is benzene with a **-CF3** (trifluoromethyl) group.  
- The -CF3 group is highly hydrophobic (similar to a tert-butyl group in terms of sterics but with some polarity).  
- Comparing to similar molecules:  
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (dichlorobenzene) has logP = ~2.94.  
  - `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1` (diethylbenzene) has logP = 2.8114.  
  - The -CF3 group is less hydrophobic than an ethyl group but more hydrophobic than a single Cl.  

### Predicted logP:
Given the balance between the hydrophobic benzene ring and the moderately hydrophobic -CF3 group, the predicted logP for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is approximately **2.5**.  

### Final answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.5** (estimated logP).  

*(Note: The actual experimental logP of trifluoromethylbenzene is ~2.68, so this prediction aligns reasonably well with the trend observed in the examples.)*

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -3.2214000000000005
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be **logP (logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. 

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (**highly hydrophilic**) have **low (negative) logP values** (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a logP of **-3.5854**).
- The given molecule has **6 hydroxyl groups**, making it even more hydrophilic than some of the examples.

Comparing structurally similar examples:
1. `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (5 OH groups): **-3.5854**
2. `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2` (less hydrophilic): **-0.0872**
3. `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (polar but fewer OH groups): **-0.0649**

Given the **higher number of hydroxyl groups** in `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (6 OH groups) compared to the example with 5 OH groups, we can infer that its logP will be **even lower (more negative)** than **-3.5854**. 

### Predicted logP: **~ -4.0**  
(Estimated range: **-4.0 to -3.8** based on the trend of increasing hydrophilicity with additional OH groups.)

### Rationale:
- The cyclic structure with 6 OH groups is **extremely hydrophilic**, similar to sugars like glucose or mannitol, which typically have logP values in the range of **-4 to -3**.
- The linear polyol example (`OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`) already has a logP of **-3.5854**, and cyclization with an additional OH group would further reduce logP. 

Thus, a reasonable prediction is **-4.0**.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 2.1284
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule contains a multi-ring steroid-like structure (similar to some of the larger examples, e.g., "CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O" and "CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C"). These structures tend to have higher property values due to their size and complexity.
2. **Polar functional groups**: It has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O), hydroxyl groups (C-OH), and an ester linkage (C(=O)O), which can influence the property. Polar groups can either increase or decrease the value depending on their arrangement (e.g., "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" has a very negative value due to high polarity, but steroid-like structures with polar groups often have higher positive values).
3. **Conjugation**: The presence of conjugated systems (C=CC=C) and carbonyls may contribute to the property value.
4. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., "ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl" with a value of 6.223).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest structural analogs are the steroid-like molecules in the dataset:
  - "CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C" has a value of **4.2693**.
  - "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C" has a value of **4.8401**.
- The given molecule has additional polar groups (ester and hydroxyl) and conjugation, which may slightly increase the value compared to these examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid-like examples and the additional polar/conjugated features, the predicted value is likely in the range of **4.5 to 5.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 4.75**  

This balances the influence of the steroid core (high value) with the polar groups (which could slightly elevate it further).

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 3.9591000000000034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be related to **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity (higher values = more hydrophobic).

### Key observations from the given examples:
1. **Hydrophobic groups (alkyl chains, aromatic rings)** increase logP (e.g., **CCCCCCC#C** has logP = 2.59).
2. **Polar groups (OH, C=O, N, O)** decrease logP (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1** has logP = -1.6476 due to multiple polar groups).
3. **Steroids and polycyclic structures** tend to have moderate logP values (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** has logP = 3.6092).

### Analysis of the target molecule:
The structure is a **steroid-like polycyclic system** with:
- **Four fused rings** (high hydrophobicity contribution).
- **One ketone (C=O)** and **one hydroxyl (OH)** group (polar, reducing logP).
- **No highly polar or charged groups** (e.g., no acids, amines, or halogens).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (logP = 3.6092):  
  Similar fused rings + 1 OH group. The target molecule has an additional C=O but fewer aromatic rings, which may balance out.
- **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (logP = 0.501):  
  Has polar amides, which are more polar than the target's C=O/OH.

### Predicted logP:
Given the steroid-like core and moderate polarity, the logP is likely **~3.5–4.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted logP = 3.75** (midway between 3.6092 and 4.0, accounting for the C=O/OH balance).

### Final answer:

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.5531999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Attached to the benzene ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene): Property = 1.6034.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (nitrobenzene): Property = 1.5948.
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** (nitro-substituted amide): Property = 1.1077.
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1** (acetamide derivative, but no nitro): Not directly in the dataset, but simpler amides tend to have lower values (~1.0-1.5).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The nitro group tends to increase the property value compared to simple aromatic systems (e.g., nitrobenzene = 1.5948).
   - The acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) is polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro, so it may moderate the effect.
   - The molecule is a **nitro-acetanilide**, which combines the effects of both groups.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The presence of both nitro and acetamide groups suggests a value higher than nitrobenzene (1.5948) but not as high as heavily halogenated or large hydrophobic systems (e.g., >3.0).
   - The closest analog is **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (1.6034), where the methoxy group is less polar than acetamide. The acetamide is more polar but not drastically so.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **1.6 to 1.8**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted Property: 1.65**  

This balances the contributions of the nitro group (raising the value) and the acetamide group (moderating the increase).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 4.236100000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a bulky, polar group with sulfur, which may increase the property value due to its size and potential for interactions.
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC)**: The sulfur in this group can also contribute to higher property values, as seen in molecules like **CSSC (1.6274)**.
3. **Chlorinated benzoxazole (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The benzoxazole core is aromatic and planar, contributing to moderate property values (similar to other aromatic systems like **c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC) (1.5528)**).
   - The chlorine substituent (Cl) tends to increase the property value, as seen in **Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (3.4932)** and **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 (3.6468)**.
4. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as halogens or sulfur.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines features from multiple high-property-value examples:
  - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (3.4932)**: Chlorinated aromatic.
  - **CSSC (1.6274)**: Disulfide linkage.
  - **CC34CC(=O)C1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4(=O) (3.2664)**: Bulky polycyclic structure.
  - **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 (3.6468)**: Multiple chlorines.
- The presence of **P(=S)**, **Cl**, and **SC** suggests a higher property value than simple aromatics but likely less than highly chlorinated or polycyclic systems like **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7.274)**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combination of a chlorinated aromatic, phosphorothioate, and thiocarbamate groups, the property value is likely in the range of **3.5 to 4.0**. 

A reasonable estimate is **3.8**, balancing the contributions of the sulfur and chlorine substituents with the moderately bulky core.

### Final Answer:
**3.8**

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.0248
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a property value of **0.6347**.
   - **CC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol) is not explicitly listed, but **CC(C)(C)CO** is a similar structure with an extra methylene group.
   - Longer alkyl chains or branching tend to increase the property value slightly (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O** has a value of **2.7277**).

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching generally reduces the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCC** has a value of **1.4163**, while **CC(C)CO** has **0.6347**).
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO**, so we expect a slightly lower value.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.6347
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is more sterically hindered, which may further reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The additional branching in **CC(C)(C)CO** (compared to **CC(C)CO**) suggests a slight decrease in the property value.
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **0.6347**, likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.6**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.55** (approximate, based on structural similarity and branching effects). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.*

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.35380000000000006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Rings**: 
   - `c1ccccc1` (benzene) is not directly given, but derivatives like `Cc1ccccc1N` (methylaniline) have a value of 1.57722, and `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has 1.2688. This suggests that simple aromatic systems with small substituents tend to have values around 1-2.

2. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen and Oxygen**:
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (a fluorinated uracil derivative) has a negative value (-0.5088), likely due to the polar and hydrogen-bonding nature of the molecule.
   - `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1` (a nitro-dichlorobenzene) has 2.9016, indicating that nitro groups and halogens increase the value.
   - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a methoxy-purine-like structure) has 0.4284, showing that fused nitrogen heterocycles with oxygen substituents can have lower values.

3. **Fused Nitrogen Heterocycles**:
   - The molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is a fused bicyclic system with multiple nitrogens and a carbonyl group (similar to purine or imidazole derivatives). From the examples, such structures tend to have lower values, especially when hydrogen-bonding groups (like `[nH]`) are present.

4. **Hydrogen Bonding and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with strong hydrogen-bonding donors/acceptors (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C` with value 0.491) tend to have lower values. The presence of `[nH]` and `C=O` in the target molecule suggests significant hydrogen bonding, which may reduce the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`: This is a pyrimidine derivative with a carbonyl and fluorine, value = -0.5088.
- `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2`: This is a methoxy-purine derivative, value = 0.4284.
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C`: This is a hydantoin derivative, value = 0.491.

The target molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is a fused imidazole-pyrimidine system with two `[nH]` groups and a carbonyl, making it highly polar and hydrogen-bonding. This is most similar to the pyrimidine derivative with a value of -0.5088, but with an additional fused ring and more hydrogen-bonding sites. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong hydrogen-bonding character and similarity to the pyrimidine derivative, the value is likely slightly higher than -0.5088 but still negative or very low positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.35** 

This accounts for the additional fused ring and hydrogen-bonding effects compared to the examples.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5678
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Values**:
   - **Esters (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, 2.204)**: Esters tend to have moderate property values (~1.5–2.5).
   - **Ethers (e.g., CCOC(C)C, 1.8214)**: Ethers also fall in the moderate range (~1.5–2.0).
   - **Carbonyls (e.g., CC(=O)O, not explicitly listed but similar to esters)**: Carbonyl-containing compounds (aldehydes, ketones, esters) often have values in the 1.5–2.5 range.
   - **Small polar molecules (e.g., CC(C)O, 0.3871)**: Small alcohols or polar molecules have lower values (<1.0).
   - **Aromatic/cyclic systems**: Larger or more conjugated systems (e.g., polyaromatics) have higher values (>3.0).

2. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is an ester (R-COOR') with a small alkyl group (methyl) and an acetyl group. Structurally, it is similar to other esters and small polar molecules in the dataset.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CCOC(C)C (ether)**: 1.8214
     - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (phosphate ester)**: 2.204
     - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4... (steroid ester)**: 4.8401 (but this is much larger and more complex).
   - Methyl acetate is simpler than most esters in the dataset but should fall in the lower-mid range of ester values.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given its small size and ester functionality, the property value is likely slightly lower than the phosphate ester (2.204) but higher than the simple ether (1.8214). A reasonable estimate would be around **1.9–2.0**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **1.92**.

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 3.3306000000000013
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl (benzene) rings attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea functional group (**N-C(=O)-N**). The structure can be broken down as:
- A central urea group (**O=C(N-)N-**).
- Two **N-phenyl** substituents (attached to the urea nitrogens).

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substitution**:
   - Molecules with phenyl rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) tend to have property values in the range of **2.0–3.5**, depending on substituents.
   - For example:
     - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol with chloro substituent): **2.0456**
     - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthalene derivative): **3.14822**
     - **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** (polyaromatic): **3.388**

2. **Urea/Carbamate Functional Groups**:
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (carbamate): **2.02164**
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic urea): **0.3772**
   - Urea derivatives with aromatic groups tend to have higher values than aliphatic ones.

3. **Symmetry and Additional Phenyl Rings**:
   - The presence of two phenyl rings (like in **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**) suggests additive or synergistic effects, likely increasing the property value compared to single-phenyl analogs.

### Comparison and Prediction:
- The molecule is structurally similar to **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (property = **2.02164**), but with two phenyl rings instead of one and no alkyl groups. The additional phenyl ring and urea core would likely increase the value.
- The property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** should thus be higher than **2.02164** but not as high as polyaromatic systems like naphthalene derivatives (~3.0–3.5).
- A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **2.5–2.8**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the symmetry and the urea core with two phenyl rings, the predicted property value is:  
**2.6147** (this aligns with the trend of aromatic urea derivatives in the given data). 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 3.2578000000000014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring. It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant aromaticity and planarity.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) typically have property values in the range of **1.5–2.6** (e.g., `c1ccccc1` would likely fall in this range, though not explicitly given). 
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, a polycyclic aromatic) have a higher value of **5.1462** due to extended conjugation.

2. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH) has a value of **5.1462**.
   - Fluorene is smaller but still has fused aromatic rings, so its value should be lower than this but higher than simple benzenes.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` (a fused ring with substitutions) has a value of **0.8498**, but this is less aromatic due to substitutions.
   - `C1C=CCC=C1` (a non-aromatic cyclic structure) has a value of **1.8926**.

### Prediction:
Fluorene is more aromatic and conjugated than simple benzenes but less extended than larger PAHs. Based on the examples:
- It should be **higher than benzene-like systems (~2.0)** but **lower than large PAHs (~5.0)**.
- A reasonable estimate is **~3.5–4.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to its fused aromaticity.

Looking at the closest examples:
- `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (complex fused heterocycle) has **3.3381**.
- `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two linked phenyl rings) has **4.102**.

Given fluorene's structure, a value **closer to 4.0** is plausible. 

### Final Prediction:
**4.102** (same as `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, as fluorene has similar aromatic conjugation but slightly more rigidity). 

However, since fluorene is more fused, I'd adjust slightly higher. A refined estimate is **4.25**. 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I'll predict:  
**4.2335** (similar to the trend for fused aromatics). 

### Exact Answer:
**4.2335** (based on interpolation of similar structures). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is, for example, logP or polarizability, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)*

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.5594299999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains highly polar groups: **sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O))**, **guanidine-like (NC(=N)N)**, and an **aromatic amine (c1ccc(N)cc1)**. These groups can significantly influence the property, likely increasing its value due to their polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The presence of a benzene ring with an amine substituent (electron-donating) and a sulfonamide group (electron-withdrawing) suggests moderate to high polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamide groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**, property = 3.22838) tend to have values in the 3-4 range.
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, property = 0.5809) can vary widely, but the sulfonamide here is more dominant.
   - The guanidine-like moiety (NC(=N)N) is highly polar, similar to the sulfonamide, and may push the value higher.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is medium-sized with a balance of polar and aromatic components, suggesting a property value in the mid-range (not extremely high like large hydrophobic molecules or very low like small, highly polar ones).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above analysis, the molecule's property value is likely in the range of **2.5 to 3.5**. A reasonable estimate, considering the sulfonamide and guanidine-like groups, is:

**Predicted Property Value: 3.0** (with an uncertainty of ±0.5 based on the examples). 

For specificity, I would predict **3.1**, as it aligns with sulfonamide-containing molecules in the dataset (e.g., 3.22838 for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**) while accounting for the additional polarity of the NC(=N)N group. 

### Final Answer:
**3.1**

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.9242000000000035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Highly substituted aromatic ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring with two nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) and a trifluoromethyl group (**C(F)(F)F**), which are strongly electron-withdrawing. This will significantly increase the molecule's polarity and likely its property value.
2. **Tertiary amine group (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is a moderately polar but bulky substituent, which may not dominate over the nitro and trifluoromethyl effects.
3. **Alkene substituent (CC(C)=C)**: This is a non-polar group, but its impact is likely minor compared to the strongly polar nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (4.6604)**: This has two aromatic rings with chlorine substituents (electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro or CF3). The property value is high due to symmetry and halogen substitution.
- **CCC(=C(CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2 (4.8286)**: Two aromatic rings with polar hydroxyl groups, leading to a high value.
- **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (5.929)**: Multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings, resulting in a very high value.
- **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (1.3004)**: A nitro group and a hydroxyl group, but only one aromatic ring, leading to a lower value.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (3.0869)**: Two chlorines and a polar amide group, giving a moderately high value.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has **two nitro groups and a CF3 group** on a single aromatic ring, which are even more electron-withdrawing than chlorines or hydroxyls. However, it lacks the symmetry or multiple rings seen in the highest-value examples. 

Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects, we expect a **high property value**, likely between **3.5 and 4.5**. A reasonable estimate is **3.8–4.2**, but considering the CF3 group's strong impact (similar to multiple chlorines), I predict:

**Predicted property value: 4.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend that strongly polar/electron-withdrawing groups increase the value in the given examples.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5678
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Hydrocarbon chains (e.g., CCCC...)**: Longer chains tend to increase the property value (e.g., CCCCCCC(C)O = 1.9475, CCCCCCCC(=O)C = 2.9359).
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, C=O)**:
     - Alcohols (-OH): Generally moderate values (e.g., CCCCCO = 2.3392, OC1CCCCCC1 = 1.7015).
     - Ethers (-O-): Slightly lower than alcohols (e.g., CCOC(=O)C = 1.7397).
     - Esters (-COO-): Moderate values (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1 = 0.8682).
     - Aldehydes (-CHO): Lower values (e.g., CCCC=O = 0.9854, C=CC=O = likely similar).
   - **Branching**: Branching tends to slightly reduce the property value (e.g., CCC(C)(C)O = 1.1673 vs. CCC(O)CC = 1.1673).
   - **Multiple polar groups**: Can significantly lower the value (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO = -2.3072).

2. **Specific Examples Similar to CC(C)OC=O**:
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide): -0.5084 (contains C=O and N, polar).
   - **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid): Not directly given, but esters/aldehydes with C=O are ~0.8-1.7.
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): Not given, but similar to CCC(C)(C)O = 1.1673.
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): Not given, but similar to CCOC(=O)C = 1.7397.

3. **CC(C)OC=O Structure**:
   - This is **isopropyl formate** (an ester with a branched alkyl group).
   - It has:
     - A branched chain (CC(C)-).
     - An ester group (-OC=O).
   - Compared to **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate, likely ~1.7), the branching (isopropyl) may slightly reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Esters with simple chains: ~1.7-2.0.
- Branching reduces the value slightly (e.g., by ~0.2-0.5).
- Thus, **CC(C)OC=O** would likely be slightly lower than **CCOC=O** (~1.7), perhaps around **1.4-1.6**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **1.5**.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 2.0090399999999997
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (cresol derivative) with a methyl group at position 1 and another methyl group at position 3, and a hydroxyl group at position 4.
   - It resembles **phenolic compounds** in the dataset (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` with a value of **1.3922** and `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` with a value of **0.59**).
   - The presence of **two methyl groups** will increase hydrophobicity slightly compared to phenol, but the hydroxyl group retains some polarity.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **1.3922**
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene): ~**2.5** (not in dataset, but similar to `Cc1ccccc1C` with **2.55742**)
   - The hydroxyl group reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Adjustment for Substitution**:
   - Adding a second methyl group (as in xylene) increases the value, but the hydroxyl group offsets this.
   - The dataset shows that **electron-donating groups (like -OH and -CH3) on aromatic rings** tend to result in values in the **1.5–2.0** range.

4. **Predicted Value**:
   - Given the balance between the two methyl groups (increasing hydrophobicity) and the hydroxyl group (decreasing it), the predicted value is likely close to **1.6**.

### Final Prediction:
**1.62** (rounded to match the precision of similar examples in the dataset). 

This aligns with trends observed for substituted phenols and toluenes in the provided data.

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 3.6130200000000023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate Derivatives (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules containing the **P(=S)** group with aromatic substitutions tend to have property values in the range of **4.1 to 4.7**.
     - Example: `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **4.652**
     - Example: `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **4.4941**
     - Example: `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **4.5429**

2. **Aromatic Substitutions**:
   - The presence of **Cl, Br, or I** on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value slightly compared to other substituents (e.g., alkyl or thioether groups).
   - Example: `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` → **2.699** (higher than non-halogenated aromatics).

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The **SC** group (thioether) is present in the target molecule. From the examples, thioether substitutions (e.g., `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → **1.177**) do not drastically increase the property value like halogens, but they may contribute moderately.

4. **Methyl (C) Group**:
   - Methyl substitutions (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` → **2.00904**) tend to have a neutral or slight increasing effect on the property.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The target molecule is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**  
- Contains the **P(=S)** core (consistent with the high-value phosphorothioate examples).
- Has a **thioether (SC)** and a **methyl (C)** substitution on the aromatic ring (no halogens).
- Compared to the phosphorothioate examples with halogens (values ~4.5), the lack of halogens and presence of SC/C may slightly reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the phosphorothioate core and the substituents (SC and C), the property value is likely slightly lower than the halogenated phosphorothioates but still in the **high range**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**~4.2 to 4.4**.  

Looking at the closest analog without halogens (but with P(=S)), the value is likely similar to:  
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` → **4.1983**  
- The target molecule has slightly more aromatic contributions, which may increase the value slightly.

### Final Predicted Value:  
**4.3** (approximate, likely between 4.2 and 4.4).  

If forced to pick a specific value from the trend, I would predict:  
**4.3** (closer to the non-halogenated phosphorothioate examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the apparent trend in the data where P(=S) derivatives with aromatic substitutions yield high values, and substituents like SC/C moderate it slightly.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 6.620600000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **7.274**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **7.9274**.
   - These molecules are heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structures, and their property values are very high (~7-8).

2. **Less Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** has a property value of **2.699**.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a property value of **4.0058**.
   - These show that increasing chlorine substitution increases the property value.

3. **Given Molecule**:
   - The molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a chlorinated biphenyl derivative with **6 chlorine atoms** (similar to the examples above but slightly less chlorinated than the highest examples).
   - It is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (7.274) but has one fewer chlorine on the second ring.

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- The molecule is less chlorinated than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (7.9274) but more chlorinated than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (7.274).
- The missing chlorine (compared to the 7.9274 example) would likely reduce the property slightly, but the presence of 6 chlorines still suggests a very high value.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction would be **~7.6**, interpolating between the two closest examples.

### Final Answer:
**7.6** (approximate, based on structural similarity and chlorination trend).

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6731
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes**: 
   - **CC (ethane)**: 1.0262  
   - **CCC (propane)**: 1.4163  
   - **CCCCCCCCO (octanol)**: 2.3392  
   - **CCCCCCCCC (nonane)**: 3.7569  
   As chain length increases, the property value generally increases.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:  
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): 1.4112  
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): 1.42996  
     Nitro groups tend to give values in the ~1.4 range unless other factors dominate.  
   - **Polar Groups (e.g., OH, C=O)**:  
     - **O=C1CNC(=O)N1**: -1.1742 (highly polar, cyclic amide)  
     - **CC(=O)C**: Not explicitly given, but similar to **CC(=C)C=O** (1.7485).  

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - No direct examples of simple nitroalkanes, but **CCCN(=O)=O** is a nitropropane.  
   - Comparing to **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (4.1482), which has multiple nitro and other groups, the value is higher.  
   - The nitro group is polar but less so than multiple nitro groups or other heavy substituents.

4. **Chain Length + Nitro**:
   - **CCCN(=O)=O** has a 3-carbon chain + one nitro group.  
   - Similar to **CCC (propane)**: 1.4163, but the nitro group will increase polarity slightly.  

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The nitro group adds some polarity but not as much as multiple nitro groups or heavy halogens.  
- The value should be slightly higher than propane (1.4163) but lower than trinitrobenzene (1.4112).  
- A reasonable estimate is **~1.45**, balancing the alkane contribution and the nitro group's effect.  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 1.45**

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 2.5882000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher property values, especially when multiple halogens are present or when they are on aromatic rings.
   - Example: 
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 3.1025 (Cl and Br on benzene)
     - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl → 5.9672 (multiple Cl on two benzene rings)
     - BrC(Br)Br → 2.4547 (three Br on a single carbon)

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - Monosubstituted halogens on benzene rings give moderate values:
     - Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 → Not directly given, but similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (COc1cccc(Cl)c1 → 2.3486, where OCH3 is slightly electron-donating).
   - Disubstituted halogens (especially ortho/para) increase the value:
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → 3.1025 (Cl and Br are para to each other).

3. **Fluorine Substitution**:
   - Fluorine is less bulky and less polarizable than Cl/Br, so it may contribute less to the property value. For example:
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 → 1.7841 (F on benzene, but with an amide group).
   - No direct example of F and Br on benzene, but we can interpolate.

4. **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**:
   - This is a benzene ring with F and Br substituents (likely para to each other, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1).
   - Fluorine is less electron-withdrawing than Cl/Br, so the property value may be slightly lower than Cl/Br analogues.
   - Comparing to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (3.1025), replacing Cl with F (smaller, less polarizable) might reduce the value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (3.1025)**, but with F instead of Cl, the property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is expected to be slightly lower. A reasonable estimate would be around **2.9**.

However, looking at other examples:
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 → 2.3486 (Cl + OCH3, electron-donating)
- Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O → 1.90322 (NO2 is strongly electron-withdrawing)
- BrC(Br)Br → 2.4547 (three Br on aliphatic carbon)

Given that F is less impactful than Cl but still electron-withdrawing, and Br is heavy/polarizable, a value between **2.8 and 3.1** seems plausible. A precise interpolation suggests **~2.95**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is **2.95**.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 2.1935000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Framework**: The molecule is a bicyclic structure with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and two tertiary carbons (attached to methyl groups). It resembles steroid-like or terpene-like frameworks seen in some of the examples (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a property value of 2.4188).
2. **Polarity**: The hydroxyl group introduces some polarity, but the bulky alkyl groups (methyl and cyclic) reduce overall polarity. This is similar to **CC(C)(C)CO** (property = 1.0248), which also has a hydroxyl group and bulky alkyl groups.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is medium-sized (bicyclic, 10 carbons) but less complex than some of the larger polycyclic examples (e.g., the steroid-like molecule with property = 2.4188).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (1.0248): Smaller, less cyclic, but similar -OH and bulky alkyl groups.
- **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (2.4188): Larger, more polar groups, but similar bicyclic/steroid framework.
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (6.1133): Much larger, with aromatic rings and halogens, but shares some bicyclic character.

Given the smaller size and lack of highly polar or aromatic groups, the property value should be lower than the steroid-like examples but higher than simple alcohols like **CC(C)(C)CO**. 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**, balancing the hydroxyl group's polarity and the bulky bicyclic framework's hydrophobicity. 

**Final Prediction: 1.55** (rounded to match the precision of the given examples).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 2.5801000000000007
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 3.8782). The presence of P(=S) with alkoxy groups (OCC) suggests moderate hydrophobicity.
   
2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure (a cyclic imide with an aromatic ring), which is polar but also has significant hydrophobic character due to the aromatic ring. Compare this to simpler cyclic imides or amides in the dataset (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C**, property = 1.3511), but the aromaticity here increases hydrophobicity.

3. **Overall Polarity vs. Hydrophobicity**: The molecule has both polar (P=O, C=O, N) and hydrophobic (aromatic ring, alkyl chains) regions. The balance leans toward moderate hydrophobicity, similar to the example with P(=S) and phthalimide (property = 3.8782).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**: Property = 3.8782. This is very similar to the target molecule but has an additional thioether (S-C) group, which is slightly more hydrophobic. The target molecule replaces this with an N-lactam, which is slightly less hydrophobic.
- **Other aromatic + polar groups**: Molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** (property = 2.8699) or **CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = 1.6288) have lower values due to more polar groups.

### Adjustment:
The target molecule lacks the thioether (S-C) group present in the closest example (property = 3.8782), so its hydrophobicity should be slightly lower. However, the aromatic lactam still contributes significantly. 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~3.6**, considering the balance between the phosphorothioate (moderate hydrophobicity) and the aromatic lactam (high hydrophobicity), but slightly less than the 3.8782 example due to the absence of the thioether.

**Final Prediction: 3.7** (rounded from the inferred trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—likely logP or a similar hydrophobicity metric—this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 1.4844199999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core (two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring with a carbonyl group, resembling a uracil or hydantoin derivative). This is similar to some of the provided examples with heterocyclic cores (e.g., **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2**, property = 0.7004).
2. **Aromatic Systems**: It has two aromatic rings (a benzene ring and a pyridone-like ring), which can increase the property value due to conjugation and hydrophobicity (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**, property = 3.00254).
3. **Substituents**: Two methyl groups (**C**) are attached to the nitrogen atoms, which add hydrophobicity but are less polar than other substituents like halogens or hydroxyl groups.
4. **Polarity**: The carbonyl group (=O) introduces some polarity, but the overall molecule is moderately hydrophobic due to the aromatic systems and methyl groups.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 3.00254): This has a similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and methyl groups, but with more extended conjugation. Our molecule is slightly less conjugated, so the property value might be slightly lower.
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = 3.3211): This has a carbazole-like structure, which is more hydrophobic due to the fully fused aromatic system. Our molecule is less fused but has a carbonyl group, balancing the hydrophobicity.
- **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.7004): This has a more polar core (two carbonyls and NH groups) and a single aromatic ring, leading to a much lower value. Our molecule is less polar and more aromatic.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the moderately hydrophobic aromatic systems, the polar carbonyl group, and the methyl substituents, the property value is likely in the range of **2.5 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.85**  

This aligns with the structural similarity to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (3.00254)** but accounts for the slightly reduced conjugation and polarity in the given molecule.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 2.1298000000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Carbon chain length and branching**: 
   - Longer carbon chains tend to increase the property value (e.g., **CCCCC** has 2.1965, while smaller molecules like **COC=O** have negative values).
   - Branching slightly reduces the value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCC(C)C** vs. **CCCCC**).

2. **Functional groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - **CCOC(=O)N** has 0.1016 (small ester with an amide-like group).
     - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate) has 2.91.
     - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is similar to methyl nonanoate but with one fewer carbon and an ethyl group instead of methyl. The ethyl group might slightly increase the value compared to methyl.

3. **Polar groups**:
   - Hydroxyl (**-OH**) and other polar groups (e.g., **-NH**, **-Cl**) can significantly reduce the value if present (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)CO** has -2.3072).
   - The ester group (**-COO-**) is less polar than hydroxyl but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a 6-carbon ester (ethyl hexanoate).
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate, 9-carbon ester) has 2.91.
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has 2.1965.
   - The ester group adds some polarity but the long carbon chain dominates.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Hexane (**CCCCCC**) would likely have a value slightly higher than pentane (~2.5, extrapolating from **CCCCC** = 2.1965).
- The ester group (**-COO-**) adds a slight polar component but not as much as hydroxyl/amine groups.
- Ethyl hexanoate is smaller than methyl nonanoate (2.91), so its value should be slightly lower.

A reasonable estimate is **~2.6**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC: 2.6** (likely between 2.5 and 2.7 based on trends).
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 1.4732
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **1.8633**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, differing only by one fewer carbon in the ester group (methyl instead of ethyl).

2. **Effect of Ester Chain Length**:
   - Shorter alkyl chains in esters tend to slightly decrease the property value compared to longer chains (e.g., ethyl vs. methyl). For example:
     - **CC(=O)OC** (methyl acetate) has a lower value than **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate).
   - However, the difference is often small (~0.1–0.3 units).

3. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic esters (e.g., benzoates) tend to have higher values than aliphatic esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)C** at 0.9579 vs. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** at 1.8633).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyl benzoate (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) = **1.8633**,
- Methyl benzoate (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is nearly identical but with a shorter alkyl chain, we expect a slightly lower value.

A reasonable estimate is **~1.75–1.80**. Averaging similar examples and accounting for the methyl/ethyl difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.78** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the given data). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is based on structural analogies and trends in the provided data. If more context were available (e.g., the property is logP), the prediction could be refined further.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.7485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (2-butene): Property value = **1.9725**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property value = **2.3296**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon): Property value = **4.4872**

   These examples suggest that conjugation (alternating single and double bonds) or extended π-systems tend to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes or isolated double bonds.

2. **Simple Alkenes vs. Conjugated Dienes**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (isolated double bond): **1.9725**
   - **C=CCC=C** (conjugated diene): Expected to be higher due to conjugation.

3. **Comparison with Other Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): **2.6391**
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): **1.9505**

   The property value for **C=CCC=C** should be higher than simple alkenes but lower than aromatic systems or highly conjugated polyenes.

### Prediction for **C=CCC=C**:
- The molecule is a conjugated diene, which increases electron delocalization compared to isolated double bonds. 
- Based on the examples, the value should be slightly higher than **C/C=C/C (1.9725)** but lower than **C=Cc1ccccc1 (2.3296)**.
- A reasonable estimate would be around **2.1 to 2.3**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is **2.15**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples. The actual value may vary depending on the specific property being measured, but this prediction aligns with the trends observed in the data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 2.4547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a very high value (7.9274), indicating that heavy halogenation increases the property.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of 3.6023.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of 3.4932.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a bromo-chloro-fluoro compound) has a value of 2.5085.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated methane, analogous to chloroform (CHCl₃), but with bromine instead of chlorine.

2. **Size and Halogen Count**:
   - Smaller molecules with multiple halogens tend to have moderate-high values (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** at 2.5085).
   - The property increases with the number of halogens and their size (bromine > chlorine > fluorine).

3. **Aliphatic vs. Aromatic Halogenation**:
   - Aromatic halogenation (e.g., bromonaphthalene) tends to have higher values than aliphatic halogenation (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**).

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
- This is a small, fully brominated aliphatic molecule (analogous to chloroform but with bromine). 
- Compared to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (2.5085), **BrC(Br)Br** has three bromines (larger and more polarizable than fluorine/chlorine), so the property should be higher.
- However, it is not as large or conjugated as aromatic halogenated compounds (e.g., bromonaphthalene at 3.6023), so the value should be lower than those.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **BrC(Br)Br** is **~2.8**. 

This balances:
- The high contribution from three bromines (similar to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but higher due to bromine's larger size).
- The lack of aromaticity or extended conjugation (which would push the value higher, as in bromonaphthalene).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 2.8** (estimated range: 2.7–3.0).

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 3.878200000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 4.3319). This group tends to increase the property value due to its bulkiness and polarity.
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many examples, contributing moderately (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** = 2.7683).
3. **Chlorine substituent (CCl)**: Halogens like Cl often increase the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** = 4.3002).
4. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: Similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 3.1013), contributing polarity and rigidity.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are moderately polar but less impactful than halogens or phosphorothioate.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is most similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4.3319), but with additional complexity (lactam ring, ethoxy groups). The lactam ring may slightly reduce the property compared to the simpler aromatic Cl-substituted case.
- Another close example is **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (4.3002), but our molecule has less halogenation and more polar groups.

### Adjustments:
- The phosphorothioate group suggests a value >4, but the lack of multiple halogens and the presence of the lactam ring may pull it down slightly.
- The ethoxy groups are less impactful than halogens, so the value should be lower than 4.3319 but higher than simpler aromatic systems (e.g., ~3.0).

### Predicted Property:
Considering the balance of these factors, a reasonable prediction is:  
**3.8**  

This accounts for the high contribution from the phosphorothioate group, moderate contributions from the Cl and aromatic ring, and the dampening effect of the lactam and ethoxy groups.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of higher values correlating with bulkiness/polarity/halogenation in the examples.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.8699000000000012
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be related to **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which measures hydrophobicity/lipophilicity. 

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar/ionizable groups**:
   - Amide (**C(=O)N**): Moderately polar (reduces logP).
   - Tertiary amine (**N(C)C**): Slightly polar but less than primary/secondary amines.
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic ring (**c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)**): Adds hydrophobicity (increases logP).
   - Heterocycle with N and O (**n2nc(oc2=O)**): Polar but balanced by the aromaticity and carbonyl.
   - Bulky tert-butyl group (**C(C)(C)C**): Highly hydrophobic (significantly increases logP).

2. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (logP = 0.2296): Less hydrophobic due to two polar amides.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (logP = 4.6604): High logP due to two chloro-substituted aromatic rings.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O** (logP = -0.8561): Very polar due to multiple H-bond acceptors/donors.
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC** (logP = 6.4876): Pure hydrocarbon (maximal hydrophobicity).

3. **Key observations**:
   - The chloro-substituted aromatic ring and tert-butyl group dominate, pushing logP higher.
   - The amide and heterocycle moderate the hydrophobicity but are offset by the bulky nonpolar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar and nonpolar features, the logP is likely **~2.5–3.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted logP = 3.1**  

This aligns with:
- The chloro-aromatic contribution (~2.5–4.5 in examples).
- The tert-butyl group adding ~0.5–1.0 over simpler alkyls.
- The polar groups reducing logP by ~1.0–1.5 compared to a fully nonpolar analog.  

Thus, **3.1** is a plausible intermediate value.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 5.144700000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I)**:
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (4.6604) has two Cl atoms.
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4.0058) has four Cl atoms.
     - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` (4.007) has one Cl atom but a fused aromatic system.
   - The property increases with the number of Cl atoms and their proximity to aromatic rings.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Fused or extended aromatic systems (e.g., biphenyl-like structures) increase the property value. For example:
     - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` (4.007) has a biphenyl-like structure with one Cl.
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (4.6604) has a biphenyl-like structure with two Cl atoms.

3. **Hydroxy Groups (-OH)**:
   - Hydroxy groups on aromatic rings (phenolic -OH) tend to slightly lower the property value compared to pure halogenated aromatics, but the effect is less pronounced than halogens. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2.699) has two Cl and one -OH.
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4.0058) has four Cl and one -OH (still very high due to Cl dominance).

4. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - Symmetrical molecules with multiple halogen substitutions (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`) will likely have additive effects from the halogens and aromatic systems.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**:
- It has **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other).
- It has **two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen bridge** (diphenyl ether-like structure).
- It has **two phenolic -OH groups**.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2.699) has two Cl and one -OH.
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (4.6604) has two Cl and a biphenyl structure.
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4.0058) has four Cl and one -OH.

The target molecule has fewer Cl atoms than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` but more than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`. The diphenyl ether structure is similar to biphenyl but with an oxygen linker, which may slightly reduce the property compared to direct fusion. The two -OH groups will also slightly lower the value.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value should be between **3.5 and 4.5**, closer to the biphenyl-like structures but adjusted for the -OH groups and oxygen linker. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.85**

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 1.9725
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property being predicted appears to be **logP (logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient)**, which is a measure of a molecule's hydrophobicity. 

Looking at the given molecules and their logP values, we can observe trends:
- Simple hydrocarbons like `CC/C=C/C` (1.9725) and `CCCC` (not explicitly listed, but similar to `CC/C=C/C`) have logP values around 1.5–2.0.
- The molecule `CC/C=C\C` is structurally very similar to `CC/C=C/C` (both are butene isomers with the same molecular formula and similar branching). 

The only difference between `CC/C=C/C` (1.9725) and `CC/C=C\C` is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs. trans). However, stereochemistry typically has a minor effect on logP unless there is significant polarity or steric hindrance. 

Given the similarity, the predicted logP for `CC/C=C\C` would be very close to that of `CC/C=C/C`. 

### Predicted logP for `CC/C=C\C`: **~1.97** (likely in the range of 1.95–2.0). 

For specificity, I would predict:  
**1.97** (same as `CC/C=C/C` due to negligible stereochemical impact on logP in this case).

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.4329
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**:
   - **C** (methane): 0.6361  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): 0.6395  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 1.0296  
   - **CC=C** (propene): Not explicitly given, but similar to propyne, likely ~0.6-1.0).  
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): 3.1428 (longer chain increases the property).

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 0.3871  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): 1.1673  
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): 1.2055  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): 1.8633  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol): 1.4008 (ether + phenol).  
   Ethers (C-O-C) seem to have moderate values, e.g., **COc1ccccc1O** (1.4008).

3. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to lower the property slightly (e.g., **CC(C)O** vs. linear alcohols).  
   - **CCCOCC** is a linear ether, so it may have a higher value than branched ethers.

4. **Molecular Size**:
   - Larger molecules (more carbons/atoms) generally have higher property values (e.g., **CCCCCCC=C** at 3.1428).  
   - **CCCOCC** has 5 carbons and an oxygen, placing it in the mid-range.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- It is a linear ether (similar to **COc1ccccc1O** but without the aromatic ring).  
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate, 1.8633), **CCCOCC** lacks the aromatic and carbonyl groups, so its value should be lower.  
- Compared to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, 1.1673), the ether linkage (O) is less polar than an alcohol (OH), so the value may be slightly lower.  
- The closest simple analog is **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate, 1.2055), but **CCCOCC** lacks the carbonyl group, so its value should be slightly lower.  

### Estimated Property Value:
Given these comparisons, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOCC** is:  
**1.10** (with uncertainty ~±0.2).  

However, looking at the trend for ethers and similar-sized molecules, a more precise estimate might be closer to **1.30**.  

### Final Answer:
**1.30** (predicted property value for CCCOCC).

True Property: 3.767700000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a tertiary amide group (**N(C=O)C**) linked to two aromatic rings (phenyl groups, **c1ccccc1** and **c2ccccc2**) and a bulky **C(C)(C)** group (tert-butyl-like fragment attached to one of the phenyl rings).
2. **Polarity**: The amide group is polar, but the two large aromatic rings and the bulky tert-butyl-like group dominate the molecule's hydrophobicity.
3. **Size/Weight**: The molecule is relatively large (MW ~ 280-300 g/mol) with significant hydrophobic surface area due to the two phenyl rings.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Aromatic Rings + Bulky Groups**: 
  - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two phenyl rings linked by an ethyl bridge) has a property value of **3.4718**.
  - **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (polyaromatic with methyl groups) has a value of **5.76304**.
- **Amide-Containing Aromatics**:
  - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (amide + aromatic rings) has a value of **3.3381**.
  - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (amide + aliphatic rings) has a value of **2.0823**.

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of two phenyl rings and a bulky **C(C)(C)** group suggests higher hydrophobicity than simpler amides but less than polyaromatic systems.
2. The tertiary amide adds some polarity, but the overall structure is dominated by hydrophobic character.
3. The value is likely between **3.0** and **3.5**, closer to **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (3.4718)** but slightly lower due to the polar amide.

### Predicted Property Value:
**3.2** (approximate, likely between 3.1 and 3.3 based on the examples). 

Given the similarity to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (3.3381)**, but with slightly less hydrophobicity due to the lack of a thiophene ring, a refined prediction is:

**Predicted value: 3.25** (interpolated between 3.1 and 3.4). 

However, rounding to two decimal places (as in many examples), the final answer is:

**3.25** (or **3.3** if rounded further). 

For consistency with the precision in the examples, I'll select **3.25** as the predicted value. 

### Final Answer:
**3.25**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 2.4074999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular features. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with small substituents (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, halogens) tend to have property values in the range of **1.5 to 3.0**.
     - Example: `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)` → **1.5772**
     - Example: `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` → **2.61186**
     - Example: `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` → **2.9934**
     - Example: `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` → **1.5948**
     - Example: `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` → **2.5882**
     - Example: `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` → **1.2047**
     - Example: `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **2.1547**
     - Example: `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` → **1.57722**

2. **Amide Groups (-NHC=O)**:
   - The presence of an amide group (e.g., `-NHC=O`) tends to slightly reduce the property value compared to similar aromatic systems without it.
     - Example: `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` → **0.3772**
     - Example: `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → **3.7677** (higher due to bulky groups)

3. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine on an aromatic ring tends to increase the property value compared to hydrogen or smaller substituents.
     - Example: `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` → **2.5882**
     - Example: `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **2.1547**
     - Example: `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` → **3.9741**

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** has:
     - An aromatic ring with a bromine substituent (similar to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **2.1547**).
     - An amide group (`-NHC=O`) attached to the ring, which may slightly reduce the value compared to a simple hydroxyl or halogen substituent.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends:
- The bromine substituent alone (as in `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`) gives **~2.1547**.
- The amide group (`-NHC=O`) is less polar than a hydroxyl group (`-OH`) and may slightly reduce the value.
- The acetyl group (`CC=O`) is moderately polar but not as impactful as the bromine or aromaticity.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely slightly lower than **2.1547** but still in the same general range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: ~1.85**

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. If the property is something like logP or molar refractivity, the reasoning would align well.)

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 2.8851000000000013
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to the property (which appears to be **logP**, the partition coefficient representing hydrophobicity). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with alkyl substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): 1.57722  
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): 2.55742  
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): 3.11842  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (pyrene, highly aromatic): 5.1462  

   The property increases with larger/less polar alkyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

2. **Branching effects**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): 0.6347  
   - **CCCC(C)O** (pentanol with branching): 1.1673  
   Branching tends to slightly increase hydrophobicity compared to linear chains.

3. **Isobutylbenzene structure**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an isobutyl group (branched 4-carbon chain) attached to benzene.  
   - Compare to **CCc1ccccc1** (ethylbenzene, linear 2-carbon chain): 2.55742  
   - Compare to **CC(C)c1ccccc1** (isopropylbenzene, branched 3-carbon chain): ~3.11842  

   The isobutyl group is longer than isopropyl but less branched than tert-butyl, so its contribution should be between ethyl and isopropyl, adjusted for the extra carbon.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Ethylbenzene: **2.55742**  
- Isopropylbenzene: **3.11842**  
- Adding one more carbon (isobutyl) would likely increase the value slightly but not as much as going from ethyl to isopropyl due to reduced branching impact.  

A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **~2.8–3.0**.  

Looking at the examples, **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene, with an extra methyl) is **3.11842**, so isobutylbenzene (one fewer methyl) should be slightly lower.  

**Final predicted property value: ~2.9**  

*(Note: If the property is indeed logP, experimental values for isobutylbenzene are ~3.0–3.3, aligning with this reasoning.)*  

**Answer: 2.9** (approximate based on the given data).  

*(If more precision is needed, a value like 2.92 or 2.95 could be justified, but the examples suggest rounding to 2–3 decimal places.)*

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 1.4990999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic aldehydes/ketones**: 
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide with a hydroxyl group) has a value of **0.4911**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **1.503**.
   - **c1cncnc1** (a simple heteroaromatic) has a value of **0.4766**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (a cyclic urea with two phenyl groups) has a value of **1.7696**.

2. **Benzene derivatives with polar groups**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole) has a value of **1.6952**.
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a value of **1.3004**.

3. **Aldehyde/ketone contributions**:
   - The aldehyde group (**O=C**) tends to increase the property value slightly compared to simple aromatic systems but less than nitro or hydroxyl groups.

### Analysis of **O=Cc1ccccc1**:
- This is **phenylacetaldehyde**, which has:
  - A benzene ring (contributing ~1.5–2.0 based on simple aromatics like **c1ccccc1**).
  - An aldehyde group (**O=C**) directly attached to the ring (similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**, but without the hydroxyl or amide group).
- The aldehyde is less polar than a nitro or hydroxyl group, so the value should be lower than **1.3004** (nitrophenol) but higher than **0.4766** (heteroaromatic).

### Comparison with Similar Structures:
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.4911) has two polar groups (amide and hydroxyl), while **O=Cc1ccccc1** has only one (aldehyde). The aldehyde is less polar than an amide, so the value should be slightly lower than **0.4911** but still in the same range.
- **c1cncnc1** (0.4766) is a heteroaromatic with no aldehyde, so **O=Cc1ccccc1** should be slightly higher due to the aldehyde.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is likely in the range of **0.4–0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.48** (close to the heteroaromatic and benzamide examples, adjusted for the aldehyde group). 

However, looking more closely, **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.4911) has two polar groups, while **O=Cc1ccccc1** has one, so the value should be slightly lower. A more precise estimate is:

**Final predicted property value: 0.45** (reflecting the aldehyde's intermediate polarity). 

But given the variability in the examples, **0.48** is also plausible. For consistency with the closest analog (**NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** at 0.4911), I'll round to:

**Predicted property value: 0.49**. 

However, since the aldehyde is less polar than the amide+hydroxyl, a slight reduction gives:

**Final answer: 0.47**. 

After reconsidering, the most balanced estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.48**. 

But to align with the trend, I'll settle on:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**. 

Given the examples, the most reasonable single-point prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.47**. 

However, reviewing the data again, the closest simple analog is **c1cncnc1** (0.4766), and the aldehyde should add a small increment, so:

**Final predicted property value: 0.50**. 

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.48**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll provide:

**Predicted property value: 0.486**. 

Rounding to 3-4 decimal places as in the examples:

**Final answer: 0.486**. 

However, the examples often have 4-5 decimal places, so for consistency:

**Predicted property value: 0.4860**. 

But given the variability, I'll stick to:

**Predicted property value: 0.486**. 

After further reflection, the most defensible estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.49**. 

Thus, the final predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is:

**0.49**. 

---

**Final Answer: 0.49** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the majority of the examples). 

However, some examples have higher precision, so if more decimals are preferred:

**0.4860**. 

But the most practical answer is:

**Predicted property value: 0.49**.

**Final Predicted Value: 0.49**

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.07349999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the aromatic ring (similar to the first example, where Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of 4.6939). Nitro groups are highly polar and can significantly increase the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring with heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a furan-like ring (o1) and a nitro-substituted aromatic ring, which can contribute to polarity and conjugation.
3. **Urea-like fragment (N-C(=O)-N)**: This is a polar and hydrogen-bonding moiety, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a value of 3.7677).
4. **Additional carbonyl (C=O) groups**: These increase polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The presence of the nitro group and multiple polar groups (C=O, N) suggests a higher property value, similar to molecules like:
  - Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (4.6939)
  - CN(C(=O)N(C)C)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3 (3.2829)
  - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (1.3421, but this is simpler and lacks nitro)
- The urea-like fragment and additional conjugation push the value higher than simpler nitroaromatics.

### Predicted Value:
Given the combined effects of the nitro group, polar carbonyls, and urea-like structure, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **3.5 to 4.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 3.85**  

This balances the contributions from the nitro group (high polarity) and the urea-like fragment (moderate polarity). The exact value would depend on finer details of the molecular conformation, but this is a plausible estimate based on the given examples.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 3.1256000000000013
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic systems like **c1ccccc1** (benzene) are not directly listed, but substituted aromatics are present.
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **1.2688**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **4.102**.

2. **Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - Nitrogen substitutions (e.g., -NH2, -N=) tend to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - The presence of multiple aromatic rings or conjugated systems increases the property value (e.g., **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** has a value of **5.0206**).

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This reduces conjugation slightly but retains significant aromatic overlap.

4. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a value of **4.102**.
   - The single-bonded version (**N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) would likely have a slightly lower value due to reduced conjugation, but still higher than simple aniline (**1.2688**).

### Prediction:
Given the reduced conjugation compared to the azobenzene-like structure but still significant aromatic and nitrogen contributions, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is likely slightly lower than **4.102** but higher than **1.2688**. A reasonable estimate would be around **3.5**.

However, looking at the example **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (4.102)**, the single-bonded version might be closer to **3.7-3.8**, but the closest match in the given examples is **Nc1ccccc1 (1.2688)** and **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (4.102)**. 

Given the lack of exact matches, a conservative estimate would be **3.7**.

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.08720000000000011
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring). 
   - It resembles a cyclic imide (similar to succinimide or glutarimide derivatives).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically reduces hydrophobicity or increases solubility in polar solvents.

3. **Ring Systems**: 
   - The 5-membered ring (cyclopentane) and the fused 6-membered ring (with two carbonyls) suggest moderate lipophilicity, but the polar amides dominate.

4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 1.185): This is a similar cyclic imide with alkyl substituents. The additional alkyl groups here increase lipophilicity slightly compared to our target molecule.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not in the list, but simpler imides like succinimide would likely have lower values, e.g., ~0.5-1.0).
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.3772): This is a less lipophilic cyclic urea/amide, but our target has more ring strain and fewer alkyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar amides and the moderately lipophilic cyclic structure, the property value is likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.95** (specific value interpolated from similar examples). 

This aligns with cyclic imides of this size and polarity in the provided dataset.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 5.313800000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with three chlorine atoms attached to two connected benzene rings. Specifically:
- It has two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl structure).
- One ring has two chlorines (positions 1 and 4), and the other ring has one chlorine (position 2).

### Comparison to Given Examples:
1. **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **2.9934**.
2. **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl-like structure) has a property value of **6.4955**.
   - This is a heavily chlorinated biphenyl with 6 chlorines, leading to a much higher value.

Our molecule (**Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**) has **3 chlorines**, which is intermediate between these two examples. 

### Key Observations:
- Chlorine substituents increase the property value (hydrophobicity/logP-like property).
- Biphenyl structures (two rings) increase the value compared to single-ring systems.
- The value scales with the number of chlorines but not linearly (e.g., 2 Cl → ~3.0, 6 Cl → ~6.5).

### Prediction:
Given the structure:
- It is less chlorinated than the hexachloro example (6.4955) but more than dichlorobenzene (2.9934).
- The biphenyl core adds ~1.5–2.0 over a single ring (compare **Cc1ccccc1C** at 3.11842 vs. **Cc1ccccc1N** at 1.57722).
- Adding a third chlorine (compared to dichlorobenzene) would increase the value further.

A reasonable estimate is **~4.2–4.6**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 4.5** (approximate, likely between 4.2 and 4.8 based on structural trends). 

This aligns with the trend of increasing value with more chlorines and larger aromatic systems.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 2.811400000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - The property values appear to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity. Higher values indicate greater hydrophobicity.
   - Simple alkyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., toluene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene) have values in the range of **2.0–3.8**:
     - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): 1.577  
     - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): 1.644  
     - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 3.8094  
   - The property increases with longer alkyl chains (e.g., hexylbenzene has a higher value than toluene).

2. **Diethylbenzene Structure**:
   - The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is **diethylbenzene**, with two ethyl groups attached to a benzene ring.
   - Ethylbenzene (one ethyl group) would likely have a value around **2.5–3.0** based on trends (e.g., toluene ~2.0, propylbenzene ~3.0).
   - Adding a second ethyl group increases hydrophobicity further, but not linearly (due to steric effects and reduced incremental contribution of each alkyl group).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 3.8094  
     - A single long alkyl chain contributes significantly.
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): 1.644  
     - Nitrogen in the ring reduces hydrophobicity compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** has two shorter ethyl groups, so the value should be lower than hexylbenzene but higher than ethylpyridine or toluene.

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends:
- Toluene (~2.0) < Ethylbenzene (~2.5) < Diethylbenzene (~3.0) < Hexylbenzene (3.8094).  
- The symmetric substitution (two ethyl groups) suggests a slight increase over mono-substituted ethylbenzene but not as high as a single long chain.

**Predicted value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1: ~3.2**  

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the examples:
- **CCCC(=O)CC** (4-carbon ketone): 1.7656  
- **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ester): 2.1298  
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 3.8094  

Diethylbenzene is less hydrophobic than hexylbenzene but more than smaller alkylbenzenes. A reasonable estimate is:

**Final predicted value: 3.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on logP-like behavior. If the property is something else, the reasoning would differ.)

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.08379999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline group (Nc1ccc(cc1))** attached to a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)**. 
   - The aniline moiety is aromatic with an electron-donating **-NH2** group.
   - The sulfonamide group is polar and electron-withdrawing due to the **S=O** bonds and the **-N** attached to sulfur.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 1.177): This is an aniline with a nitro group (**-NO2**), which is also electron-withdrawing. The sulfonamide group in our target molecule is somewhat analogous in terms of polarity and electron-withdrawing effects, though sulfonamides are typically less strongly electron-withdrawing than nitro groups.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property = -0.0649): This is a purine derivative with multiple nitrogens, showing that highly polar/N-containing heterocycles can have lower values.
   - **Oc1ccncc1** (property = 0.7872): A pyridine derivative with an -OH group, indicating moderate polarity.

3. **Electron Effects**:
   - The **-NH2** group donates electrons to the ring, while the **-S(N)(=O)=O** group withdraws electrons. This push-pull effect is similar to the nitroaniline example but with slightly less extreme withdrawal (sulfonamide vs. nitro).

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar due to the sulfonamide and amine groups but is not excessively large or hydrophobic.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 1.177) but with a slightly less electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group, the property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** should be **slightly higher** (less negative/more positive) than 1.177. 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **1.3 to 1.6**. Splitting the difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.45**

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 4.487200000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like** or **benz[a]anthracene-like** structure. It can be represented as:

```
      4
    /   \
1---2   3
    \   /
      5
```
(Where the numbers represent the fused rings, and the structure is highly conjugated.)

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with extended conjugation (e.g., fused aromatic rings) tend to have higher property values. 
   - Example: 
     - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (5 fused rings) → **5.45462**
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (5 fused rings) → **5.6404**
     - `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (4 fused rings) → **4.30142**

2. **Substituents and Heteroatoms**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) or polar groups often increase the property value slightly, but the dominant factor here is the aromatic system size.

3. **Given Molecule**:
   - The molecule has **4 fused benzene rings**, similar to benz[a]anthracene.
   - No heteroatoms or substituents are present, so the value will be lower than halogenated analogs but higher than smaller fused systems (e.g., naphthalene or anthracene).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is approximately **4.6**.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 2.2155000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) or other polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, halogens) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (4.0676) has polar groups and aromatic rings.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (1.0978) has two -OH groups but is smaller and less complex.
   - **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** (7.1837) has multiple -OH, aromatic rings, and a bromine atom.

2. **Aromatic Rings and Conjugation**: Extended conjugation (e.g., fused aromatic rings) increases the property value. For example:
   - **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** (5.6404) is highly conjugated.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (5.3138) has two aromatic rings with halogens.

3. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: Larger molecules with multiple functional groups or rings tend to have higher values. For example:
   - **CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3** (6.372) is large and has multiple ether and aromatic groups.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (5.929) is large and heavily halogenated.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is:
```
Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
```
- **Structure**:
  - It has **three hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and **one carbonyl group (C=O)**.
  - It contains **two fused aromatic rings** (benzofuran-like structure) and **an additional aromatic ring (c3ccc(O)c(O)c3)**.
  - The molecule is **highly polar and conjugated** due to the -OH groups and aromatic systems.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs in the examples are:
  - **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** (7.1837): This has multiple -OH, aromatic rings, and a bromine atom. Our molecule lacks the bromine but has similar -OH density and conjugation.
  - **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (3.5601): This has two aromatic systems with -OH groups and a carbonyl, but our molecule has more -OH groups and a fused ring system.
  - **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (4.0676): This has polar groups and aromatic rings but fewer -OH groups than our molecule.

### Prediction:
Given the **three -OH groups, fused aromatic rings, and carbonyl group**, the molecule is highly polar and conjugated. Its property value should be **higher than 4.0676** (due to more -OH groups) but **lower than 7.1837** (due to lack of heavy halogens). 

A reasonable estimate is **~5.2**, considering:
- The additional -OH groups increase the value compared to simpler aromatic systems.
- The lack of halogens or very large hydrophobic regions prevents it from reaching the highest values (e.g., >6).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 5.2** (likely between 5.0 and 5.5 based on structural similarity to the examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 1.24
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate group (P=O)**: Present in many of the higher-valued examples (e.g., 4.5429, 5.6015, 4.1983). This group tends to increase the property value.
2. **Thioester (SC)**: The presence of sulfur (S) in a thioester linkage is somewhat polar but not as strongly as other sulfur-containing groups in the examples (e.g., Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1 has a low value of 0.0586).
3. **Amide (NC(C)=O)**: Amides are polar but not as strongly contributing as nitro or multiple halogens. Examples with amides (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1: 0.1805) suggest moderate contributions.
4. **Methoxy (CO)**: Ether linkages are common in mid-range examples (e.g., COc1ccc(C=CC)cc1: 2.7283).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: This has a value of 4.5429, but it has multiple chlorine atoms which significantly increase the value. Our molecule lacks halogens.
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: This has a very high value (5.6015) due to multiple chlorines and a phosphate group. Our molecule is simpler.
- **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: This has a value of 4.1983, with a phosphate-like group and sulfur, but also a larger alkyl chain and amide. Our molecule is smaller but has similar features.

### Predicted Value:
Given the phosphate group (P=O) and the thioester (SC), but no strongly contributing groups like halogens or nitro groups, the property value is likely in the mid-to-upper range but not as high as the heavily halogenated examples. 

A reasonable estimate would be around **3.8 to 4.2**. 

Given the similarity to **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (4.1983)**, but with a slightly simpler structure, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 4.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

For a more precise estimate, I would lean toward **3.95**. 

However, since the examples suggest values like 4.1983 for somewhat similar structures, I'll refine my prediction to:

**Final predicted value: 4.1** (balancing the phosphate contribution and the simpler structure). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is **4.1**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of polar/functional group contributions in the given data.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 1.9352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a high value of **7.274**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2,4-dichlorophenol) has a value of **2.699**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4-chloroaniline) has a value of **1.9222**.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a value of **1.4012**.
   - **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane) has a value of **2.1814**.

   Halogen substitution generally increases the property value, with heavier/more halogens leading to higher values.

2. **Small Alkenes with Halogens**:
   - The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small alkene with two chlorine atoms. 
   - Compared to **CCBr** (1.4012) and **CCCCBr** (2.1814), the presence of two chlorines and a double bond would likely increase the property value further due to increased polarity and molecular weight.

3. **Double Bonds**:
   - **CCC=O** (butanal) has a value of **0.5953**, but this includes a carbonyl group.
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (2-methyl-2-pentene) has a value of **2.3626**, suggesting that unsaturation (double bonds) increases the property value compared to saturated analogs.

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- The molecule is a small, symmetrical dichlorinated alkene. 
- Given that **CCBr** is 1.4012 and **CCCCBr** is 2.1814, two chlorines would likely increase the value further. 
- The double bond adds polarity and rigidity, contributing to a higher value.
- Comparing to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2.699), which has two chlorines and a phenol ring, **Cl\C=C/Cl** is smaller but similarly polar.

A reasonable estimate for **Cl\C=C/Cl** would be slightly lower than **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** but higher than **CCCCBr**. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**2.45** (approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the examples, but the value fits the trend of halogenated small molecules.

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 1.0816
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values in the range of **1.7 to 3.5**, depending on substituents.
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) has a value of **1.7283**.
   - **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **3.45664**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a high value of **5.7372**, suggesting that larger conjugated systems increase the property value.

2. **Heteroaromatic Systems**:
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a complex heteroaromatic) has a very low value of **0.4284**, likely due to its highly polar and nitrogen-rich structure.
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (a nitrogen-rich bicyclic heteroaromatic) has a value of **0.72822**.
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a nitrogen-containing polycyclic) has a value of **2.783**.

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a simple 6-membered heteroaromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is less polar than poly-nitrogen heterocycles but more polar than benzene.
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline, where nitrogen is exocyclic) has a value of **1.7283**.
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (more complex nitrogen-containing system) has a value of **2.783**.
   - Pyridine is likely to have a value between these, closer to the simpler aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is expected to have a property value slightly higher than benzene derivatives but lower than poly-nitrogen systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: ~1.85**  

This is based on:
- Simplicity of the ring (like benzene derivatives).
- Presence of one nitrogen (increasing polarity slightly compared to benzene).

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 3.141800000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups, likely representing **logP (partition coefficient)** or a similar hydrophobicity-related metric. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Polar groups**: 
   - Two hydroxyl groups (**OCC(O)**), an ether linkage (**COC(=O)**), and an amide-like **Nc2ccnc3** (hydrogen-bond acceptor/donor).
   - These reduce hydrophobicity (lower logP).

2. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - A benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**) and a fused heteroaromatic system (**nccnc3** with a chloro-substituted ring). 
   - Aromaticity increases logP, but polar substitutions (e.g., **Cl**) moderate this.

3. **Chlorine substituent**: 
   - **Cl** on the aromatic ring (electron-withdrawing) slightly increases logP compared to unsubstituted analogs but less than non-polar alkyl groups.

4. **Ester linkage (**COC(=O)**)**: 
   - Moderately polar, contributing a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic character.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (logP = 3.3306): Similar diphenylamide core but with more aromaticity. Our molecule has fewer aromatic rings but additional polar groups.
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (logP = 3.4789): Biphenyl ether, highly hydrophobic. Our molecule has more polar groups but similar conjugated systems.
- **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (logP = 2.9446): Halogenated aromatic, but our molecule has more polar moieties offsetting this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar groups (OH, ether, amide) and aromatic/chlorine contributions, the predicted value is likely **~2.4 to 2.8**. A refined estimate based on the examples is:

**Predicted property value: 2.65**  
*(This aligns with the structural hybrid of polar and hydrophobic features, similar to mid-range examples like Cc1ccccc1Cl (2.64842) but with additional polarity from the glycol and amide groups.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.1689
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): 2.6391  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): 3.2752  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 3.3918  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): 2.0237  
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): 0.1793  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): -0.2108  

   Longer and more branched hydrocarbon chains tend to increase the property value, while polar functional groups (e.g., esters like C=O) reduce it.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)...** (a complex ester): 2.1284  
   - **COc1ccc...** (methoxy-substituted aromatic): 2.4421  
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1O...** (dihydroxy-substituted aromatic): 5.1447  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol): 2.0916  

   Hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) generally increase the property value, especially in aliphatic chains or aromatic systems. The effect is more pronounced with multiple hydroxyl groups.

3. **Aliphatic Alcohols**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol, 2-methyl-2-pentanol): 1.8034  
   - **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) is a primary alcohol with a linear chain.  

   Compared to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched, tertiary alcohol with value 1.8034), a linear primary alcohol like **CCCCCO** would likely have a higher property value due to less steric hindrance and increased accessibility of the hydroxyl group.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- The molecule is a linear aliphatic alcohol with 5 carbons.  
- Similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol, 2.0916) but with a shorter chain, the value should be slightly lower.  
- Compared to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (1.8034), the linear chain and primary alcohol nature suggest a higher value.  
- The presence of the hydroxyl group dominates over the hydrocarbon chain's contribution.  

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCO** is:  
**Predicted property value: ~2.0** (likely between 1.9 and 2.1).  

For specificity, I will predict:  
**2.05** (close to the cyclooctanol example but adjusted for chain length).  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: 2.05**

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.3016
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, often contributing to moderate property values (e.g., ~2.5–3.5).
2. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Polar and electronegative, likely increasing the property value.
3. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Polar and hydrogen-bonding, contributing to higher values (e.g., ~3.0–4.0 in similar structures).
4. **Heterocyclic ring (CCO1)**: Adds complexity and polarity.
5. **Alkyl group (CC)**: Small hydrophobic contribution, but minor compared to polar groups.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (3.2711)**: Contains sulfonyl-like (P=S) and aromatic systems.
- **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (4.3432)**: Contains amide and aromatic rings, similar to our molecule.
- **CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2 (4.3991)**: Polar groups and aromatic systems lead to higher values.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of aromaticity, sulfonyl, and amide groups, the property value is likely in the **3.5–4.0 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 3.75**  

This balances the contributions of the polar groups (raising the value) and the lack of extreme halogenation or very large hydrophobic chains (which could push it higher).

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 2.1756
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to correlate with molecular size, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.). 

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES**: `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`  

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly electron-withdrawing.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Two ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`), which are polar and moderately electron-withdrawing.
   - A methyl group (`C`) and an imine-like nitrogen (`NC=`), contributing to steric and electronic effects.
3. **Conjugation**: Extended conjugation between the aromatic ring, nitro group, and carbonyl groups, likely increasing the property value.
4. **Similar examples**:
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (large aromatic system) has a high value of **6.9192**.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (highly halogenated) has **7.9274**.
   - `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroids/cyclic systems) has **5.2797**.
   - `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (fused aromatics) has **3.14822**.
   - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrobenzene derivative) has **1.90322**.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- A nitrobenzene moiety (contributing ~2.0-3.0).
- Two ester groups (adding polarity, similar to carbonyls in other examples).
- Extended conjugation (increasing the value further).

Given these features, the property value is likely higher than simple nitrobenzenes but lower than highly halogenated or large fused systems. A reasonable estimate is between **3.5 and 4.5**. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC` (disulfide + thiocarbonyl) has **3.6212**.
- `CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid-like) has **4.5153**.

The given molecule is less bulky than steroids but more conjugated/polar than simple nitrobenzenes. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: ~3.8** (likely between 3.6 and 4.0). 

A precise estimate would be **3.75**.

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.8674000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two amide groups (**NC=O**), one cyclic ketone (**C=O**), and a cyclopropane ring (**CC1C**).
   - The molecule is a bicyclic structure with fused 5- and 3-membered rings.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The presence of multiple polar amide/ketone groups suggests moderate polarity.
   - The small bicyclic structure (5+3 rings) is compact but not as large as polyaromatic systems in the examples.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1 (1.0816)**: A small heterocycle (pyridine) with modest polarity. Our molecule is more polar but similarly small.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (4.8401)**: A large steroid-like molecule with ketones. Our molecule is much smaller but has similar polar groups.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (-0.0649)**: A polar, hydrogen-bonded heterocycle with a low value. Our molecule lacks H-bond donors but has more carbonyls.
   - **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C (1.6215)**: A small ketone with a low value. Our molecule has more polar groups but is still small.

### Key Observations:
- The property seems to correlate with **size, polarity, and aromaticity**. Large/polyaromatic systems (e.g., 3.993, 5.7372) have high values, while small polar molecules (e.g., 1.0816, 1.6215) have lower values.
- Our molecule is **small but has significant polarity** due to the amides and ketone. It lacks aromaticity or extended conjugation.

### Predicted Value:
Given its compact size and moderate polarity, the value should be **higher than small ketones (e.g., 1.6215)** but **lower than larger fused-ring systems (e.g., 3.4346)**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.1** (likely between 1.8 and 2.5 based on the examples). 

For specificity, I'll refine to **2.15**, considering the balance of polarity and size. 

### Final Answer:
**2.15**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.2451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes**: 
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a value of **2.1965**.
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane) has a value of **2.9767**.
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene) has a value of **1.7265**.
   - **C1CCC=CCC1** (cycloheptene) has a value of **2.5067**.

   These suggest that simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes) tend to have values in the range of **1.7 to 3.0**, with increasing size or branching slightly increasing the value.

2. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **2.34**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorobenzene) has a value of **4.3002**.
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorinated polycyclic) has a value of **5.2702**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of **7.274**.

   Chlorine substitution increases the property value, and the more chlorines present, the higher the value. A single chlorine (as in chlorobenzene) gives ~2.34, while multiple chlorines dramatically increase the value.

3. **Small Chloroalkanes**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is not explicitly in the examples, but we can compare it to similar small molecules:
     - **CC#N** (acetonitrile) has a value of **0.52988** (small polar molecule).
     - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a value of **2.1965** (nonpolar).
     - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **2.34** (single chlorine on aromatic ring).

   Chloroethane is a small molecule with one chlorine, similar in size to pentane but with a polar C-Cl bond. The presence of chlorine likely increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons but not as much as in aromatic systems (where conjugation plays a role).

### Prediction for ClCC:
Given that:
- Small alkanes (e.g., pentane) are ~2.2.
- A single chlorine on an aromatic ring (chlorobenzene) is ~2.34.
- A single chlorine on a small alkane (like chloroethane) would likely have a slightly lower value than chlorobenzene because aromatic systems often have higher polarizability.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **ClCC** would be slightly lower than chlorobenzene but higher than pentane, likely in the range of **2.0 to 2.3**. 

A precise prediction based on the trends would be:  
**Predicted property value for ClCC: 2.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For a more accurate prediction, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 3.5617
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl)** group and a **chlorine (Cl)** atom. 
   - Pyridine is aromatic but more polarizable than benzene due to the nitrogen heteroatom.
   - The trichloromethyl group is highly electron-withdrawing and bulky.

2. **Substituents**:
   - Chlorine atoms on the ring and the trichloromethyl group increase **molecular weight** and **polarizability**.
   - The trichloromethyl group is similar to examples like **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (2.0289)** but attached to an aromatic system, which typically increases the property value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (6.4955)**: This has two aromatic rings and a C(Cl)(Cl)Cl group, giving a high value (6.4955). Our molecule has one aromatic ring but a similar trichloromethyl group, so the value should be lower.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (5.3138)**: Two aromatic rings with chlorine substituents give 5.3138. Our molecule has one ring but a more polarizable trichloromethyl group, so the value should be slightly lower.
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl (4.8618)**: Highly chlorinated aromatic with a nitro group gives 4.8618. Our molecule lacks the nitro group but has a trichloromethyl group, which is similarly polarizable.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above comparisons, the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** likely has a property value between **4.5 and 5.0**, closer to the trichloromethyl-substituted aromatic examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 4.75**  

This balances the effects of the pyridine ring, chlorine substituents, and the highly polarizable trichloromethyl group.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 1.5574
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and trends observed in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values, I can predict the property for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol or a branched hexanol). 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols with similar chain lengths**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (likely 4-heptanol) has a property value of **1.9475**.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (likely 1-phenylethanol) has a property value of **1.7399**.
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (likely 2-methyl-1-pentanol) has a property value of **1.4149**.
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (likely 3-methyl-1-pentanol) also has a property value of **1.4149**.

2. **Branching effects**:
   - Branching tends to slightly lower the property value compared to linear alcohols (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC** is higher than **CCC(C)CCO**).
   - The position of the hydroxyl group also matters, with primary alcohols often having lower values than secondary alcohols (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC** is higher than **CCC(C)CCO**).

3. **CCCCC(C)O** is a secondary alcohol (2-hexanol) with a 6-carbon chain and one branch (methyl group at the second carbon). 

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCCC(O)CCC** (secondary alcohol, 7 carbons) = **1.9475**
- **CCC(C)CCO** (primary alcohol, 6 carbons, branched) = **1.4149**

The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (secondary alcohol, 6 carbons, branched) should have a value **between these two**, likely closer to **1.7-1.8** due to the secondary alcohol effect but slightly lower than the 7-carbon analog.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O ≈ 1.75**  

(Note: If forced to pick from the given examples, the closest analog is **CC(O)c1ccccc1 = 1.7399**, so **~1.74** would be a defensible prediction.)  

### Final answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O ≈ 1.74**

Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 3.2116000000000007
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **4.6604**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl) has a value of **5.929**, showing that larger conjugated systems increase the property.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol) has a value of **2.699**, likely lower due to the polar -OH group.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which typically increases properties like logP (lipophilicity) or molar refractivity. For example:
     - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane): 1.4215
     - **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform): 1.9864
     - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride): 2.5938  
     This suggests heavier halogens increase the property incrementally.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted benzenes (like 1,4-dibromobenzene) tend to have higher values than monosubstituted or ortho-substituted analogs due to additive effects.

### Prediction:
- **1,4-dibromobenzene** is structurally similar to 1,4-dichlorobenzene (4.6604) but with bromine instead of chlorine. Given the trend that bromine increases the property more than chlorine (e.g., compare chloroform vs. bromoform), we can estimate a **~0.5–1.0 unit increase** over the dichloro analog.
- The presence of two bromines (heavier halogens) will further elevate the property compared to chlorines.

### Estimated Property Value:
**5.2** (approximate; likely between 5.0 and 5.5 based on the halogen effect and symmetry).

### Refined Estimate:
Given that:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = 4.6604 (dichloro)  
- **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** = 2.5938 (vs. **ClCCl** = 1.4215),  
the jump from chloro to bromo is roughly +0.8–1.0 per substitution. Thus, for dibromobenzene:  
**4.6604 + (2 × 0.8) ≈ 6.3**, but this seems high.  

Alternatively, comparing **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene, not listed) to **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene, not listed), the increase is typically +0.5–0.7 per Br. Thus:  
**4.6604 + (2 × 0.6) ≈ 5.9**.  

However, the biphenyl analog (**Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl**) is 5.929, so dibromobenzene (smaller than biphenyl) should be slightly lower.  

### Final Prediction:
**5.4** (conservative estimate, balancing the halogen effect and molecular size).  

---
**Predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: 5.4** (likely between 5.2 and 5.6).

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 7.274000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic System**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (6 chlorines in total). This is similar to the second example in the dataset:  
   **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **9.8876**),  
   which has 10 chlorines and a very high property value.  

2. **Fewer Chlorines Than the Second Example**: The given molecule has 6 chlorines, while the second example has 10. The second example's property is **9.8876**, which is exceptionally high, likely due to the extreme chlorination and symmetry.  

3. **Comparison to Other Chlorinated Aromatics**:  
   - The first example, **ClC(Br)Br**, has only 3 halogens and a property of **2.2986**.  
   - Another example, **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12**, has a nitro group and fused rings, yielding **2.748**.  

4. **Impact of Chlorination**: The property seems to increase with the number of chlorines and aromatic rings. The given molecule has two fused chlorinated rings (like a chlorinated biphenyl), which would likely have a higher value than simpler chlorinated aromatics but lower than the extreme case of 10 chlorines.  

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the second example but with fewer chlorines, the property should be **lower than 9.8876** but still **relatively high** due to the aromaticity and multiple chlorines.  

Looking at other examples:  
- **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (5.76304) is a polyaromatic hydrocarbon with no halogens.  
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (9.8876) is the extreme case.  

The given molecule is intermediate in chlorination, so a reasonable estimate would be **~6.5 to 7.5**.  

### Final Prediction:
**7.2** (This is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing property value with chlorination and aromaticity.)  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is a structural similarity-based estimate.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 6.256760000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be related to **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity (lipophilicity). 

### Given Molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one substituted benzene ring), which contribute to hydrophobicity. 
2. **Substituents**: 
   - **Methyl groups (C)**: These are hydrophobic and increase logP.
   - **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)**: This is polar and hydrophilic, which would decrease logP. However, it is esterified with two aromatic rings (Oc2cccc(C)c2 and Oc3ccccc3C), reducing its polarity.
   - **Ether linkages (Oc)**: These are moderately polar but are flanked by aromatic rings, reducing their impact on hydrophilicity.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is large and has significant hydrophobic character due to the aromatic systems and methyl groups.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and hydrophobic substituents (e.g., Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1, logP = 5.3167) tend to have high logP values.
- The phosphate group here is less polar than free phosphate due to esterification, so its impact on logP is muted.
- The molecule resembles **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (logP = 5.3138) in terms of aromaticity and substituent effects, though the phosphate group may slightly reduce logP compared to chlorine substituents.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of hydrophobic (aromatic rings, methyl groups) and moderately polar (phosphate ester) features, the predicted logP value is likely in the range of **4.5 to 5.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted logP = 5.1**

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where large, multi-aromatic systems with hydrophobic substituents yield high logP values. The phosphate ester does not significantly reduce hydrophobicity due to its aromatic conjugation.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 3.514400000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**: 
   - The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (**CF3**) and a heterocyclic moiety (**N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**). 
   - Similar to examples like **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = 2.2482) or **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 1.177), where aromatic rings with polar substituents (NO2, NH2, Cl) have properties in the 1.1–2.2 range.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (CF3)**:
   - The **CF3** group is highly electronegative and lipophilic, which may increase the property value. Compare to **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (property = 2.9446), where halogens increase the value.

3. **Heterocyclic Moiety (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**:
   - This is a complex, polar, and halogenated (Cl) group with a ketone (=O). Similar to **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C** (property = 2.52334), where polar/heterocyclic groups with halogens contribute to higher values.

4. **Halogens (Cl)**:
   - Multiple Cl atoms are present, which typically increase the property value (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** has a value of 5.929).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines features of aromatic rings with polar substituents, halogens, and a heterocycle. 
- It is more complex than **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (2.2482) but less heavily halogenated than **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (5.929).
- The **CF3** group and the heterocycle with Cl and =O suggest a higher value than simple aromatic systems but not as high as heavily halogenated systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above analysis, a reasonable estimate is **~3.5**. This balances the contributions from the aromatic ring, CF3, and the polar/halogenated heterocycle.

**Final Answer: 3.5**

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.6033999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: This is an electron-donating group (EDG) that increases electron density on the aromatic ring.
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: This is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) that decreases electron density on the aromatic ring.
   - The molecule is a **para-substituted benzene ring** with these two groups.

2. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups, no EDG): Property = 1.503.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol, one -OH EDG): Property = 1.3922.
   - **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (electron-withdrawing Cl and CCl3): Property = 3.5617.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups): Property = 1.503.
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene, no EWG): Likely lower than phenol due to weaker EDG effect of -OCH3 vs. -OH.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The nitro group is a stronger EWG than Cl or CCl3, but the methoxy group is a moderate EDG.
   - The property seems to correlate with the balance of EDG/EWG effects and aromaticity.
   - In **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, the EDG (-OCH3) and EWG (-NO2) are in para positions, which may partially cancel each other's effects, leading to a moderate value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the examples and the structural balance, the property for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely **~1.6**. This is slightly higher than the dinitrobenzene example (1.503) due to the EDG effect of -OCH3 but lower than strongly electron-withdrawing systems like Cl-heavy molecules.

### Final Answer:
**1.6** (approximate predicted value based on structural analogy).

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 5.682800000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations:
1. **High Chlorine Substitution**: The molecule is heavily chlorinated (8 chlorine atoms), similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane, property value = 3.6444). This suggests a significant increase in the property due to halogenation.
2. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule is a polycyclic (tricyclic) hydrocarbon, akin to steroidal or fused-ring systems in the examples (e.g., **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, property = 5.2797). Such structures tend to have higher values due to increased molecular complexity and hydrophobicity.
3. **Electronegativity and Polarity**: The high chlorine content introduces electronegativity, but the overall symmetry and lack of polar functional groups (like -OH or -NO₂) suggest the property is dominated by size/halogenation rather than polarity.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- **Hexachlorocyclohexane (3.6444)**: Less chlorinated and simpler cyclic structure.
- **Steroid-like polycycle (5.2797)**: Larger but less halogenated.
- **Clc1ccccc1 (2.34)**: Monochlorobenzene, much smaller.

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and polycyclic nature, the property value should be **higher than hexachlorocyclohexane (3.6444)** but likely **lower than the large steroid (5.2797)** due to the absence of additional hydrophobic groups (e.g., methyl or carbonyl). 

A reasonable estimate is **~4.8**, balancing the effects of chlorine and ring complexity.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 4.8**

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.5694
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 2.7307  
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 3.923  
   - **CCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 3.4193  
   These suggest that larger aliphatic chains or rings increase the property value.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (complex polyether): 1.3386  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): 1.4455  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C(C)C** (uracil derivative): 1.1051  
   Oxygen-containing groups (ethers, esters, carbonyls) tend to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, especially when polar or hydrogen-bonding is possible.

3. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 3.6038  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 1.4455  
   Esters show variability, but simpler esters (like ethyl formate analogs) tend to have values around 1.5-2.0 unless conjugated or aromatic.

4. **Small Polar Molecules**:
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): 0.52988  
   - **NC(=O)N** (urea): -0.9762  
   Highly polar or small molecules with strong H-bonding have lower (even negative) values.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate):
- This is a simple aliphatic ester (formate ester with a propyl group). 
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, 1.4455), propyl formate lacks aromaticity and conjugation, which likely reduces the property value slightly.
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (3.6038), propyl formate is much simpler and less polarizable, so its value should be lower.
- The presence of the ester group (polar C=O and O-alkyl) suggests a value between 1.0 and 2.0, likely closer to the lower end due to lack of aromaticity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOC=O** is **1.25**. 

This is based on:
- Simplicity of the ester (no aromaticity or extended conjugation).
- Comparison to similar esters in the dataset (e.g., ethyl 4-aminobenzoate at 1.4455, but propyl formate is less polarizable). 

Thus, the predicted value is **1.25**.

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 3.6902000000000026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule is a **fatty acid ester**: it has a long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**C(=O)OCC**).
   - The ester is derived from a decanoic acid (C10) and ethanol (OCC).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Long hydrophobic alkyl chain (10 carbons).
   - Polar ester group (but less polar than a free carboxylic acid).
   - No aromatic rings or other highly polar/charged groups.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
  - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (alkylbenzene, 7C chain + benzene) has a value of **3.8094**.
  - **CCCCCC** (pure hydrocarbon) would likely have a higher value than smaller hydrocarbons like **CC** (1.0262) or **CCC1CCCCC1** (2.9767).
- **Esters and Polar Groups**:
  - **COCC(=O)N(...)** (ester + amide + aromatic) has **1.84434**.
  - **CCOc1ccccc1** (ether + aromatic) has **2.0853**.
  - **CCCOC** (ether) has **1.0428**.
  - Esters generally reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but not as much as alcohols or acids.

### Property Trend:
The property appears to correlate with **hydrophobicity/lipophilicity** (e.g., logP). Longer hydrocarbon chains increase the value, while polar groups (esters, ethers, alcohols) decrease it. 

For **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- The long 10-carbon chain suggests a high baseline (similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, but without the aromatic ring, which might slightly lower it).
- The ester group reduces the value compared to a pure hydrocarbon but not drastically (similar to how **CCOc1ccccc1** is lower than **c1ccccc1**).

### Estimated Value:
Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** would be slightly lower than **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (3.8094) but higher than simpler esters like **COCC(=O)N(...)** (1.84434). 

A good prediction is:  
**3.5** (specific value: **3.512**).

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.8595000000000006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to be **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures hydrophobicity (higher values = more hydrophobic).

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**: Present in examples like **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (logP = 2.5454)** and **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (logP ~ 2.3486)**.
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Chlorine increases logP (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has logP = 2.2482**).
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (logP = 4.2258)**.
4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (logP = 2.2482)**.
5. **Aromatic rings**: Multiple rings increase logP (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23 has logP = 4.0545**).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The molecule resembles **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (logP = 4.2258)** but has an additional nitro group and chlorine, which would increase hydrophobicity further.
- The nitro group's effect is somewhat balanced by its polarity, but the two chlorines and extended aromatic system push logP higher.

### Estimated logP:
Given the contributions:
- Base phenol + chloro + amide: ~4.2 (from the similar example above).
- Additional chloro and nitro: ~+0.5 to 0.8.

Thus, the predicted **logP ≈ 4.7 to 5.0**. A reasonable estimate is **4.85**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains two **thiophene-like rings** (due to the sulfur linkage) connected via a **disulfide-like bridge (S)**. Each ring is substituted with a **phosphate group (OP(=S)(OC)OC)**. 
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Phosphate groups (OP(=S)(OC)OC)**: These are polar and contribute to higher property values (similar to Cl-substituted aromatics in the examples).
   - **Aromatic rings with sulfur (thioether linkage)**: Sulfur-containing aromatic systems (e.g., thiophenes or disulfides) tend to increase the property value, as seen in examples like **CCSSCC (2.4076)** or **ClC=C (1.3687)** when combined with halogens.
   - **Multiple substitutions**: The molecule is highly substituted with bulky, polar groups, which typically increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **7.274** due to heavy Cl substitution).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analogs are heavily halogenated or sulfur/phosphorus-containing molecules:
     - **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: 7.274 (high due to many Cl atoms).
     - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**: 4.3319 (P=S and Cl substitution).
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 5.3138 (two Cl-substituted rings).
   - This molecule has **two phosphate groups** and **sulfur linkages**, which are less polar than Cl but still significant. The lack of halogens is offset by the P=S groups and aromaticity.

### Prediction:
Given the **two aromatic rings with sulfur bridges and two phosphate groups**, the property value is expected to be **high but slightly lower than heavily halogenated examples**. 

- The presence of **P=S** (similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a value of **4.3319**) suggests a baseline.
- The **additional aromatic ring and sulfur linkage** would increase the value further, but not as much as Cl substitutions. 

Thus, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **5.0 to 6.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 5.42**

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.3003999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule is a nitrophenol derivative (phenol with a nitro group). 
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methyl-substituted nitrobenzene) has a property value of **1.90322**.
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the benzene ring (phenol) may increase the property value compared to simple nitrobenzene derivatives due to additional polarity or hydrogen bonding.

2. **Substitution patterns**:
   - **Clc1cccc(Br)c1** (halogen-substituted benzene) has a value of **3.1025**, indicating halogens increase the property.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (tri-chlorophenol) has a value of **3.3524**, showing that multiple electronegative substituents increase the property further.
   - The nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to halogens, and would contribute significantly to the property.

3. **Hydroxyl and nitro combination**:
   - The molecule has both -OH and -NO2 substituents, which are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions. This combination typically increases the property value more than either group alone.

4. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (a more complex nitro- and chloro-substituted benzene) has a value of **4.6939**, but this is larger due to additional chloro substituents.
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** (chloroaniline) has a value of **1.9222**, which is lower due to the less electron-withdrawing -NH2 group compared to -NO2.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitrobenzene derivatives with simple substituents (e.g., methyl) are ~1.9.
- Adding a hydroxyl group (phenol) increases the property due to polarity/hydrogen bonding.
- The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, further increasing the value.

A reasonable estimate for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) would be slightly higher than **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (1.90322)** but lower than **Clc1cccc(Br)c1 (3.1025)** or tri-chlorophenol (3.3524). 

Given the strong influence of the nitro group and the hydroxyl group, the predicted value is likely around **2.4 - 2.6**. 

Looking at the examples, **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(C)C** (a carbamate ester with aromatic and branched alkyl groups) has a value of **2.5282**, which is structurally somewhat similar in terms of polarity. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is approximately **2.5**. 

### Final Answer:
**2.5** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trend). 

(Note: If more precision is required, a value like **2.52** could also be reasonable, but the examples suggest reporting to 1-2 decimal places is sufficient.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -7.571399999999989
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be **logP (logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient)**, which is a measure of a molecule's hydrophobicity or lipophilicity. 

### Analysis of the given molecule:
The molecule in question is a **complex carbohydrate (oligosaccharide)** with the structure:
```
OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
```
This is a highly polar, water-soluble molecule with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (C-O-C), which significantly increase its hydrophilicity.

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Highly polar molecules (e.g., sugars, polyols) have very low or negative logP values**:
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple sugar) has a logP of **-2.5823**.
   - `NC(N)=NC#N` (a polar, hydrogen-bonding molecule) has a logP of **-1.25912**.
2. **Hydroxyl groups and ether linkages reduce logP**:
   - `COc1ccccc1O` (guaiacol) has a logP of **1.4008**, while `CCOc1ccccc1` (phenetole) has a logP of **2.0853** (fewer -OH groups = higher logP).
3. **Larger, more polar molecules have lower logP**:
   - The given molecule is much larger and more polar than any sugar in the examples, suggesting an even lower logP.

### Prediction:
The molecule is **far more hydrophilic** than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (logP = -2.5823) due to its additional hydroxyl groups and larger size. Thus, its logP should be **significantly lower (more negative)**.

### Estimated logP:
Given the trend, a reasonable prediction is:
**-3.5 to -4.5**

For specificity, I will predict:
**-3.9** (reflecting its extreme hydrophilicity and structural complexity).

### Final answer:
**-3.9**

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 1.0295999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length and Branching**: 
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains tend to have higher property values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` = 5.0699, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` = 6.2402).
   - Branching reduces the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., `CC(C)CCOC(=O)C` = 1.5956 vs. linear analogs).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2) can increase or decrease the property depending on their electronegativity and position.
   - Aromatic rings contribute significantly (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` = 3.993).

3. **Triple Bonds (Alkynes)**:
   - The molecule `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene) has a property value of 1.42996, but this includes two nitrile groups, which are polar.
   - The triple bond in `CCC#C` is non-polar (like in hydrocarbons), but it introduces rigidity and reduces the effective "chain length" compared to a saturated analog.

4. **Small Hydrocarbons**:
   - `CCCC(=O)C` (2-pentanone) = 1.3755.
   - `CCCC(O)CCC` (4-heptanol) = 1.9475.
   - `CCCC=O` (butanal) = 1.7656.

### Prediction for CCC#C (1-butyne):
- **Structure**: A 4-carbon chain with a terminal triple bond (C≡C). 
- The triple bond is more compact than a single or double bond, so the effective "size" is smaller than butane (`CCCC`), which would likely have a value around ~2.0 (based on trends).
- The lack of polar groups or branching suggests the value should be lower than alcohols or ketones but higher than very small molecules (e.g., `CC(C)OC=O` = 0.5678).
- Comparing to `CCCC=O` (butanal, 1.7656), which has a polar C=O group, `CCC#C` should be slightly lower due to no polar contribution.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCC#C** is:  
**1.45** (slightly lower than butanal due to lack of polarity but higher than very small branched molecules).  

(Note: If the property is logP, this aligns with typical logP values for small alkynes, where 1-butyne has a logP ~1.4-1.6.)  

**Final Answer: 1.45**

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 5.391500000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group. From the examples, molecules with P(=S) groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** with a value of 4.3319) tend to have higher property values, likely due to their polarity and size.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions (c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: Highly chlorinated aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** with 7.274 and **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** with 7.274) contribute significantly to higher property values due to their hydrophobicity and molecular weight.
3. **Ethoxy groups (CCO and OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as the P(=S) or Cl substitutions. Smaller alkyl ethers (e.g., **CCCCOCCCC** with 2.6032) suggest a moderate contribution.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**: This has a P(=S) group, one Cl on the aromatic ring, and additional polar groups (amide, ester). Property = 4.3319.
- **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: This has two Cl atoms and a nitro group. Property = 4.6939.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**: This has three Cl atoms on the aromatic ring. Property = 3.6468.

Our molecule has:
- A P(=S) group (similar to the first example but with fewer polar attachments).
- Three Cl atoms on the aromatic ring (similar to the third example but with additional P(=S) and ethoxy groups).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of P(=S) and three Cl substitutions, the property value should be higher than **3.6468** (from **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**) but lower than **4.6939** (from the nitro-containing example). The P(=S) group adds significant weight/polarity, but the lack of additional highly polar groups (like nitro or amide) suggests a value closer to the first example (~4.3319). 

However, the ethoxy groups are less polar than the amide/ester in the first example, so the value might be slightly lower. 

### Final Prediction:
**4.2** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trend). 

More precisely, given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **4.1809** (similar to **c1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C**, which has a comparable mix of Cl substitutions and polar groups). 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**4.18** (or approximately **4.2**). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, molar refractivity, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with Cl/P(=S) substitutions.)

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.3149000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a pyridine derivative (6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen, `c1nccc...c1`), substituted with a **C(=O)NN** group (a hydrazide-like fragment).
2. **Polarity/Functionality**:
   - The pyridine ring contributes some polarity (similar to benzene but slightly more polar due to nitrogen).
   - The **C(=O)NN** group is highly polar due to the carbonyl (C=O) and hydrazine (NN) moieties, which can form hydrogen bonds.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1Cl** (1.9222): A chloro-aniline (less polar than our molecule due to fewer H-bond donors/acceptors).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (3.0869): A polar amide with chloro substituents (higher value due to more polar groups).
   - **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2** (-0.7716): A purine-like structure with multiple H-bond donors/acceptors (unusually low value, possibly due to tautomerization or specific interactions).
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (2.422): A naphthalene with an amino group (less polar than our molecule).

Our molecule has:
- A pyridine ring (moderate polarity).
- A **C(=O)NN** group (very polar, similar to amides/hydrazides in the examples).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the polarity and H-bonding capacity, the value should be **higher than simple aromatic amines (e.g., ~1.9-2.4)** but **lower than highly substituted polar amides (e.g., ~3.0)**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: ~2.6**  
*(Likely between 2.4 and 2.8 based on the examples.)*  

### Refined Guess:
Looking at similar polar heterocycles:
- **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (2.783): A fused heterocycle with less polarity than our hydrazide.
- **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (3.4302): A diphenylamine (less polar than our molecule but with a larger hydrophobic surface).

Thus, balancing the polar **C(=O)NN** group and the pyridine ring, the value is likely closer to **~2.7**.

**Final Prediction: 2.7**  
*(This is a qualitative estimate based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)*

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 4.198300000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a prominent feature, similar to the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a value of **2.79932**. The presence of P(=S) tends to increase the property value compared to simpler organophosphates.
   
2. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are moderately hydrophobic but not as impactful as aromatic rings or halogens. The molecule has two such chains attached to the P(=S) group.

3. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether (not a disulfide) adds some polarity but is less impactful than a sulfoxide or sulfone.

4. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is polar and can slightly reduce the property value, especially when part of a cyclic structure (here, a piperidine ring).

5. **Cyclic Structure (N1CCCCC1C)**: A substituted piperidine ring is present, which is moderately hydrophobic but not as impactful as polycyclic aromatics.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: Value = **2.79932**. This has a phosphorothioate group with an aromatic nitro group, which is more polar than our target molecule. Our molecule lacks the nitro group but has additional alkyl chains and a cyclic amide.
- **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**: Value = **3.2604**. This has a thioether, amide, and aromatic ring. Our molecule lacks the aromatic ring but has a phosphorothioate group instead.
- **CCCCCOC(=O)CC**: Value = **2.1298**. This is a simple ester with alkyl chains, much less complex than our molecule.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- The phosphorothioate group likely increases the value compared to simpler esters or amides.
- The lack of aromatic rings or halogens prevents the value from being very high (e.g., >4).
- The cyclic amide and thioether add moderate complexity.

### Predicted Value:
Given these observations, the property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is likely in the range of **2.8 to 3.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.05**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 3.3668000000000022
Predicted Property:
Based on the given examples and trends observed in the property values, the property appears to be related to **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCC (octane)**, which is a purely aliphatic hydrocarbon with no polar functional groups, the logP value is expected to be relatively high due to its strong hydrophobicity. 

From the examples:
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a logP of **1.9491** (the -OH group reduces hydrophobicity).
- **CC34CCc1c(ccc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O** (a steroid-like structure with some polarity) has a logP of **3.9444**.
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a logP of **2.7527**.
- **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (a cyclic hydrocarbon) has a logP of **3.7569**.

Since **octane (CCCCCCCC)** has no polar groups and is longer than most of the aliphatic examples given, its logP should be higher than **CCCCCCCO (1.9491)** and closer to purely hydrophobic molecules like **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45 (5.7372, a polyaromatic hydrocarbon)** but not as extreme due to its lack of aromaticity. 

A reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCC** is:  
**Predicted logP ≈ 4.5**  

(Note: The actual experimental logP of octane is ~4.00–4.50, so this aligns well with the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**: Molecules with steroid-like or fused polycyclic structures (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**) tend to have property values in the range of **3.8–4.1**. These structures often include ketones, hydroxyl groups, and multiple rings.
   - Example: **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** → **3.8792**  
   - Example: **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** → **3.8384**

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Ketone (=O)**: Increases the property value (e.g., **CC(=O)C** → **1.2314**).
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: Can increase or decrease depending on context, but in polycyclic systems, it often increases the value.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to alkenes, it may slightly increase the value (e.g., **C=C** → **0.8022**).

3. **Oxygenated Polycyclic Systems**: Molecules with multiple oxygenated groups (e.g., ketones and hydroxyls) in fused rings tend to have higher values (~3.5–4.0).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with:
- A **ketone (=O)** at one ring.
- Two **hydroxyl (-OH)** groups (one explicit, one implied by the **O** in the ring).
- An **alkyne (C#C)** group.
- Multiple fused rings (similar to other high-value examples).

Given its similarity to **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (3.8792)** and **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (3.8384)**, but with an additional alkyne (which may slightly increase hydrophobicity/polarizability), the property value should be **slightly higher** than these examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**3.92**  
*(This is consistent with the trend for oxygenated polycyclic systems, with a slight upward adjustment for the alkyne group.)*

True Property: 1.338599999999999
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, hydrogen bonding, and size. The molecule in question is:

**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) and fused ring systems, which typically increase the property value (as seen in polycyclic aromatics like `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` with a value of 5.6404).
2. **Oxygen Substituents**: There are multiple methoxy (`OCH3`) and hydroxyl (`OH`) groups, which introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. These groups can moderately increase the property (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has 2.0456).
3. **Complexity and Size**: The molecule is large and highly branched with multiple rings (including sugar-like tetrahydropyran and furan moieties), which significantly increases the property value (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` has 5.5088).
4. **Carbonyl Groups**: The presence of a ketone (`C=O`) and ester (`COC=O`) groups adds polarity but may not drastically change the property compared to the dominant effects of size and aromaticity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are large, polycyclic, and oxygen-rich molecules like `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (5.5088) and `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` (5.63). 
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and oxygen substituents suggests a value in the higher range, similar to these examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural complexity, aromaticity, and oxygen content, the predicted property value is **~5.7**. 

**Final Answer: 5.7** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trend in the examples).

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 2.0456000000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities:

1. **Substituent Effects**: 
   - The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., Cl, NO₂) tends to increase the property value compared to the unsubstituted aromatic ring.
   - The presence of an electron-donating group (e.g., OH, OCH₃) tends to decrease the property value or have a mixed effect depending on other substituents.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a value of **1.3004**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol, same value: **1.3004**).
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) has a value of **1.8257**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene) has a value of **2.9446**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) is not explicitly given, but **ClC=C** (vinyl chloride) has a value of **1.3687**, and **ClC=C(Cl)Cl** (trichloroethylene) has **2.5017**.

3. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - Phenol itself is not listed, but nitrophenol (with a strong electron-withdrawing NO₂ group) has **1.3004**.
   - Chlorophenol (**Oc1ccccc1Cl**) has a weaker electron-withdrawing Cl group compared to NO₂, so we expect a higher value than nitrophenol but lower than iodochlorobenzene (**2.9446**).

4. **Prediction**:
   - The Cl substituent is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but more than H, so the value should be between **1.3004** (nitrophenol) and **2.9446** (iodochlorobenzene).
   - Fluorobenzene (**Fc1ccccc1**) is somewhat similar, with a value of **1.8257**.
   - Given that Cl is less electronegative than F but still electron-withdrawing, a reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is slightly higher than fluorobenzene but not as high as iodochlorobenzene.

**Final Prediction**: **1.85** (close to fluorobenzene but accounting for the Cl substituent's effect). 

This aligns with the trend where:
- Electron-withdrawing groups increase the property value, but not as drastically as strong groups like NO₂.
- The OH group (electron-donating) moderates the effect of Cl. 

Thus, the predicted value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is approximately **1.85**. 

(Note: If more precise interpolation is needed, a value around **1.80-1.90** would be reasonable, but **1.85** is a good midpoint estimate.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 3.130700000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: The molecule has two chlorine atoms (one on the alkyne chain and one on the benzene ring). From the examples, chlorinated aromatic rings (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)…) tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., 3.4932 for Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, 3.6444 for ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl).
   - **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a relatively non-polar feature, but its presence in a chain may slightly increase the property compared to purely aliphatic chains.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Similar to amide/ester groups in the examples (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC has 1.2598, CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 has 1.645). This suggests a moderate contribution.
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: The Cl on the benzene ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1) is similar to Clc1ccccc1 (bromobenzene is 2.4491, chlorobenzene-like structures are ~1.6-3.5 depending on substitutions).

2. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is medium-sized with a combination of alkyne, ester/amide, and chlorinated aromatic features. Larger molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has 3.2774, similar size/complexity).

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: This has a trifluoromethyl group, chlorines, and an amide, with a value of 3.5144. Our molecule is somewhat similar but lacks the CF3 group and has an alkyne instead.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: This has a chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with 3.4932. Our molecule is less conjugated but has additional polar groups.
   - **C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: A simple biphenyl with 3.2774. Our molecule has polar substitutions (Cl, ester/amide) which may increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two chlorine atoms (increasing the value),
- An alkyne (neutral/slight increase),
- An ester/amide linkage (moderate contribution),
- Aromatic ring (base ~1.6-2.0),

The property value is likely in the range of **3.0 to 3.6**. A reasonable estimate is **3.2**, considering the balance of polar/nonpolar features and comparisons to similar molecules.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 3.2** (approximate, likely between 3.0 and 3.4).

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 4.0676000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property in question appears to correlate with molecular size, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, pyridine-like rings, etc.).

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring, `c2cncnc2`).
2. **Halogenation**: Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `c3ccccc3Cl`).
3. **Hydroxyl group**: An alcohol group (`OC`) attached to a central carbon connected to the aromatic systems.
4. **Substitution pattern**: The central carbon is bonded to two aromatic systems and a hydroxyl group, resembling a triarylmethanol derivative with additional heteroatoms.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 6.4955): This has multiple chlorinated aromatic rings and a central carbon with heavy halogenation. The given molecule is less halogenated but has a similar multi-aromatic core.
- **CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C** (property = 4.87188): This has two aromatic rings linked by nitrogen-containing groups, similar in size but less halogenated.
- **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl** (property = 7.274): Highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure, much more halogenated than the given molecule.
- **N(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C** (property = 4.87188): Similar aromaticity but no halogens; the given molecule's chlorines will increase the property value.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has significant aromaticity, moderate halogenation (two Cl atoms), and a polar hydroxyl group. It is less halogenated than the highly chlorinated examples (~6.5–7.3) but more complex than simpler aromatic systems (~3.5–4.8). The pyridine-like ring (`c2cncnc2`) may slightly reduce the property compared to pure carbocyclic systems due to its polarizability.

Given these observations, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **4.5 to 5.5**. A reasonable estimate is **5.1**.

### Final answer:
**Predicted property value: 5.1**
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.9595
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Values**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**, property = 1.3496) tend to have moderate property values (~1.3–2.0).
   - Aldehydes (e.g., **CCCCCC=O**, property = 1.7656) also fall in a similar range.
   - The presence of an **O** (oxygen) in the backbone (e.g., ethers or esters) often reduces the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon chains or halogenated compounds.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C**, property = 3.326) increase the property value.
   - Branching or cyclic structures (e.g., **C1CCCCCCC1**, property = 3.1208) also tend to increase the value.

3. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate, 5 carbons + ester): property = 1.3496.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal, 6 carbons + aldehyde): property = 1.7656.
   - **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate, 5 carbons + ester) is structurally similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** but with a formate group (HCOO-) instead of a longer acyl chain.

### Prediction for **CCCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is an ester (like **CCCC(=O)OCC**) but with a shorter acyl group (formate instead of butyrate). 
- Formates (HCOOR) are slightly more polar than higher esters, which might slightly increase the property value compared to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (1.3496).
- However, the overall carbon count is similar, so the value should not deviate drastically.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCOC=O** would be slightly higher than **CCCC(=O)OCC** but lower than **CCCCCC=O**. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.55** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

This aligns with the trend where:
- Esters with short chains: ~1.3–1.6.
- Aldehydes with similar chains: ~1.7–1.8. 

Thus, **1.55** is a plausible prediction for **CCCCOC=O**.
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4215
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a value of **1.464**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a value of **4.9536**, indicating that increasing chlorine atoms and aromaticity raise the value.
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(...)** (a highly chlorinated compound) has a value of **2.431**.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1.2-dichloroethane) is structurally similar to **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), but with one fewer carbon. Since **ClCCCl** has a value of **1.464**, **ClCCl** would likely have a slightly lower value due to its smaller size and lower molecular weight.

3. **Comparison to Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a value of **1.4012**, which is close to **ClCCCl**'s value of **1.464**. Since bromine is heavier than chlorine but **ClCCl** is smaller than **ClCCCl**, the values should be similar but slightly lower for **ClCCl**.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) should have a property value slightly lower than **ClCCCl** (1.464). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value for ClCCl: 1.35**  

*(This is based on the smaller size and fewer atoms compared to ClCCCl, while accounting for the similar electronegativity and halogen effects.)*

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 2.00904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) and polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -OCH3, halogens) tend to have higher property values.
   - For example:
     - `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether) has a value of **3.4789**.
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **2.82402**.
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` (carbazole) has a value of **3.3211**.

2. **Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - The presence of -OH on an aromatic ring (phenol-like structures) tends to increase the property value.
   - For example:
     - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) has a value of **1.0978** (lower due to lack of alkyl substitution).
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (methyl-substituted phenol) has a higher value of **2.82402**.

3. **Alkyl Substitution**:
   - Alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3) on aromatic rings tend to moderately increase the property value, especially when combined with polar groups like -OH.
   - For example:
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **2.82402**.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol or similar). 
   - It is structurally similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (value = 2.82402), but with slightly less steric bulk (two methyl groups vs. a tert-butyl group).

### Prediction:
Given the above observations:
- The presence of two methyl groups and one -OH group on the aromatic ring suggests a property value in the range of **2.5 to 3.0**.
- The exact value is likely slightly lower than `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (2.82402) because the tert-butyl group in the latter contributes more to the property value than two separate methyl groups.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is approximately **2.65**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 5.967200000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples:

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with the following features:
- Two benzene rings connected (biphenyl core).
- Multiple chlorine substitutions (5 chlorines total: 3 on one ring, 2 on the other).
- Highly halogenated and hydrophobic.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (6.6206):  
   - Similar PCB-like structure with 6 chlorines.  
   - Property value: **6.6206**.  

2. **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (7.274):  
   - Another PCB-like structure with 7 chlorines.  
   - Property value: **7.274**.  

3. **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** (4.7366):  
   - A heavily brominated benzene (less hydrophobic than chlorinated analogs).  
   - Property value: **4.7366**.  

### Key Observations:
- The property value increases with the number of halogens (Cl/Br) due to increased hydrophobicity.  
- The given molecule has **5 chlorines**, which is between the two PCB examples (6 and 7 chlorines).  

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- 6 chlorines → 6.6206  
- 7 chlorines → 7.274  

For **5 chlorines**, the value should be slightly lower than 6.6206 but still in the same range.  

### Final Prediction:
**~6.2** (likely between **6.0 and 6.5** based on interpolation).  

However, since the given examples show a steep increase with more chlorines, a reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: 6.3**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The actual value may vary slightly, but it should fall close to this range.)*

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 1.9725
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics):**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): 3.3668  
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 3.923  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** (fluorene, polyaromatic): 3.993  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (large polyaromatic): 5.6404  
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 3.4687  
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isoprene), similar to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** but with a double bond.

2. **Effect of Double Bonds:**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 3.923 (higher than octane's 3.3668) suggests double bonds slightly increase the property.  
   - **CC(=O)C=C** (methyl vinyl ketone): Not directly comparable, but unsaturation often increases the value.  

3. **Branched vs. Linear:**
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 3.4687) tend to have slightly higher values than linear alkanes (e.g., octane: 3.3668).  

4. **Small Alkenes:**
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a small branched alkene. The closest analog is **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (3.4687), but with one fewer carbon and a double bond. The double bond may increase the value slightly, while the smaller size may decrease it.  

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Branched alkane (5 carbons, no double bond): ~3.0–3.5 (e.g., **CC(C)CCC**: likely ~3.2 if it existed).  
- Adding a double bond (as in **CC=C(C)C**) would increase the value slightly.  
- **CCCCCCCCC=C** (9 carbons, one double bond): 3.923 suggests ~0.5–0.6 increase over linear alkane (octane: 3.3668).  

For **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene):
- Smaller than nonene but branched, so likely slightly lower than 3.923.  
- Comparable to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (3.4687) but with unsaturation, so ~3.5–3.7.  

### Final Estimate:
**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: ~3.6**  
(Plausible range: 3.5–3.7, likely closer to 3.6 based on branching and unsaturation effects.)  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**3.6** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the given examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarities.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4215
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with chlorine atoms tend to have moderate to high property values. For example:
     - `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a very high value of **8.5808** (highly chlorinated).
     - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **3.0682**.
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of **2.699**.
   - The more chlorines, the higher the property value tends to be.

2. **Small vs. Large Molecules**:
   - Small molecules with simple structures (e.g., `C=CCCC=C` with value **2.1386**) tend to have lower values than large, complex, or highly substituted molecules.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a small molecule with two chlorines. It is less chlorinated than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (4 chlorines, value **3.0682**) but more chlorinated than monochlorinated examples like `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` (value **2.0456**).
   - It is structurally similar to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` but with fewer chlorines, so we expect a lower value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (4 chlorines) has a value of **3.0682**,
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (3 chlorines) has a value of **2.699**,
- `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` (1 chlorine) has a value of **2.0456**,

**ClCCl** (2 chlorines) would likely have a value between **2.0456** and **2.699**. A reasonable estimate is around **2.3 - 2.5**. 

Given the simplicity of the molecule (no aromaticity or other functional groups), I would predict a value closer to the lower end of this range, similar to other small chlorinated alkanes. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: ~2.4** (e.g., **2.4**). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is logP or a similar hydrophobicity metric, this aligns with dichloromethane's known properties.)
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 3.3523999999999994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (3.3524): This is a trichlorophenol (2,4,6-trichlorophenol). The presence of three chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring yields a property value of ~3.35.
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (3.9741): This is a tribromobenzene. The property value is higher (~3.97), likely due to the heavier halogens (bromine instead of chlorine).
   - **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**: This is also a trichlorophenol (2,3,5-trichlorophenol), structurally very similar to the first example but with a different substitution pattern.

2. **Substitution Pattern**: 
   - The position of chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring affects the property value. For example, the 2,4,6-trichlorophenol has a value of 3.3524. The 2,3,5-trichlorophenol (the target molecule) is expected to have a similar but not identical value due to slight differences in electronic effects.

3. **Hydroxyl Group Influence**: 
   - The presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) tends to increase the property value compared to non-hydroxylated chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** has a higher value than simpler halogenated aromatics).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (3.3524), the target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** (2,3,5-trichlorophenol) should have a very close property value. The slight difference in chlorine substitution (2,3,5 vs. 2,4,6) may lead to a minor variation, but the overall contribution of three chlorines and a hydroxyl group suggests a value in the same range.

### Predicted Property Value:
**3.35** (approximately the same as the 2,4,6-trichlorophenol example, with negligible deviation due to substitution pattern). 

For specificity, we can round to **3.35** (matching the given example's precision). 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**3.35**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 1.338599999999999
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property for the given molecule requires analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Hydroxyl (`-OH`), carbonyl (`C=O`), nitro (`-NO2`), and other polar groups tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `OCC(O)CO` has -1.6681).
   - Halogens (`Cl`, `Br`, `F`, `I`) and aromatic rings increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has 5.9672).

2. **Molecular Size and Hydrophobicity**:
   - Larger hydrophobic molecules (e.g., alkanes like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have very high values (10.3886).
   - Smaller or more polar molecules (e.g., `C#C`) have low values (0.2494).

3. **Complexity and Hybridization**:
   - Molecules with multiple fused rings or conjugated systems (e.g., `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4`) have high values (4.45).
   - Sugars or polyols (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O`) have very negative values (-5.3972).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is highly complex with the following features:
1. **Multiple Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
   - Methoxy (`-OCH3`), hydroxyl (`-OH`), and multiple ether (`-O-`) linkages, which are polar and would decrease the property value.
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`) in one of the rings, further increasing polarity.

2. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - The molecule contains several fused rings (e.g., `C6C2C...c7cc5OCOc5cc67`), which would increase the property value due to hydrophobicity and size.

3. **Hybrid Structure**:
   - The molecule is a hybrid of a sugar-like moiety (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) and aromatic/cyclic systems, balancing polar and nonpolar contributions.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are:
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = -5.3972): Highly polar sugar, very negative.
  - `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` (property = 4.45): Fused aromatic rings, high value.
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = 1.7816): Steroid-like with polar groups.

### Prediction:
The target molecule has significant polar contributions (multiple `-OH`, `-OCH3`, `C=O`) but also large fused rings. The polar groups will dominate, but the size prevents the value from being very negative. 

**Predicted Property Value: 0.85**  
(Closer to neutral due to competing polar and nonpolar effects, but leaning slightly positive due to the fused ring system.)

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3714999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a thiazole-like ring with a sulfur atom (**S**) and a triazole-like moiety (**nnc**), along with a carbonyl group (**C=O**) and an amine (**N**). The substituent is a bulky tert-butyl group (**C(C)(C)C**).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of **S**, **C=O**, and **N** suggests moderate polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl group may reduce overall polarity.
3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: -0.33948): This has a similar pyrimidone-like structure but lacks the sulfur and tert-butyl group. The property is low due to the polar but small structure.
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: 1.0258): This has a similar tert-butyl group and a heterocyclic core with **N** and **S**. The property is higher due to the larger size and moderate polarity.
   - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property: 0.1254): A polar heterocycle with multiple nitrogens but no bulky group, leading to a low value.

### Key Observations:
- The tert-butyl group increases hydrophobicity, but the **S**, **C=O**, and **N** contribute some polarity.
- The structure is somewhat similar to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: 1.0258), but with fewer polar groups and a simpler core.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar groups and the bulky tert-butyl substituent, the property value is likely slightly lower than **1.0258** but higher than **0.1254**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.85**  

*(This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)*

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 1.8633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - `COCC(=O)OC` (methyl acetate analog) has a value of **1.7397**.
     - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) also has a value of **1.7397**.
     - This suggests that simple aliphatic esters tend to cluster around **~1.74**.
   - **Aromatic Esters**:
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is an aromatic ester (ethyl benzoate). 
     - Aromaticity often increases the property value compared to aliphatic analogs (due to conjugation and polarizability).
     - For example, `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether) has a high value of **3.4789**, but this is not an ester.
     - `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a diketone with aromaticity) has **2.0119**.
   - **Other Aromatic Systems**:
     - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1`, aniline) have values around **1.2688**.
     - Substituted aromatics with polar groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) have **1.90322**.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is structurally similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` (value: **1.1716**), but the latter is more complex with additional polar groups (sulfonyl, nitroso, etc.), which may lower the value.
   - The simpler aromatic ester should have a higher value than **1.1716** but lower than purely aliphatic esters (~1.74) due to aromatic conjugation.

3. **Estimated Value**:
   - Given that aliphatic esters are ~1.74 and aromaticity increases the value slightly, but not as much as highly conjugated systems (e.g., diphenyl ether at 3.4789), a reasonable estimate is between **1.8 and 2.0**.
   - A precise interpolation suggests a value close to **1.85**, similar to `CC13CCC(=O)C=C1CCC4C2CCC(C(=O)CO)C2(CC(O)C34)C=O` (value: **1.8457**), which has some aromatic character.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) is **1.8457**. 

This aligns with the trend of aromatic esters having slightly higher values than aliphatic esters but not as high as highly conjugated systems.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 3.351700000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane): 1.0512
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (contains Br): 1.57852
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): 3.6023
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (chlorinated biphenyl): 5.3138
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: 3.5209

   Halogens (Br, Cl, I) generally increase the property value, with heavier halogens (Br, I) having a more pronounced effect than Cl in similar contexts. The position and number of halogens also matter (e.g., more halogens → higher value).

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (2-heptanone): 2.1557
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): 1.9491
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): 3.1428
   - **CCCC (=O)C** (2-pentanone): 2.1557
   - **CCCCCC (=O)CCCC** (2-nonanone): 2.9359

   Longer hydrocarbon chains tend to increase the property value, especially if unsaturated (e.g., C=C bonds). Functional groups like ketones (=O) also contribute.

3. **Brominated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CI** (iodomethane): 1.0512 (small molecule with heavy halogen).
     - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: 3.6023 (aromatic Br, higher due to conjugation).
     - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**: 1.57852 (complex structure with Br).

   For **CCCCCCCBr**, the Br is attached to a 7-carbon chain. The property value should be higher than small alkyl halides (like CI) but lower than aromatic or polyhalogenated compounds.

### Prediction:
- The property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely between **2.0 and 3.0**, based on:
  - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): 1.9491 (similar chain length, but OH instead of Br).
  - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): 3.1428 (unsaturation increases value; Br is less impactful than C=C here).
  - **CI**: 1.0512 (Br is heavier than I, but the long chain offsets this).

Given that Br is less polarizable than I but the long chain adds to the value, a reasonable estimate is **~2.5**. 

Looking at the examples, **CCCC (=O)CCC** (2-heptanone) is 2.1557, and **CCCCCC (=O)CCCC** (2-nonanone) is 2.9359. A Br substituent is somewhat similar in effect to a ketone (=O) but slightly less impactful. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is approximately **2.4**. 

However, considering **CCCCCCCO** is 1.9491 and Br is more polarizable than OH, a slightly higher value is justified. A closer estimate is **2.6**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **2.6**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, molar refractivity, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. The value is likely between 2.5 and 3.0, with 2.6 being a reasonable midpoint.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.3915
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular properties such as **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which is a measure of hydrophobicity. 

Let's analyze the given molecule **CO (methanol)** in the context of the examples:

1. **Methanol (CO)** is a small, polar molecule with a hydroxyl group, making it highly hydrophilic. 
2. From the examples:
   - **CCC (propane)**, a nonpolar hydrocarbon, has a value of **1.4163**.
   - **CCC(C)C (branched hydrocarbon)** has a higher value of **2.8326**, consistent with increased hydrophobicity.
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O (sugar-like molecule)** has a very negative value (**-3.2198**) due to high polarity and hydrophilicity.
   - **NC(=O)N (urea)** has a negative value (**-0.9762**) due to polarity and hydrogen bonding.

3. **Methanol** is more polar than propane but less polar than sugars or urea. Its logP is experimentally known to be **-0.77**, which aligns with the trend in the data (small polar molecules have low/negative values).

### Predicted property value for **CO**: **-0.77** (consistent with its hydrophilic nature and the trend in the examples). 

(Note: If the property is not logP but another descriptor, the value would still reflect methanol's high polarity relative to the given examples.)
