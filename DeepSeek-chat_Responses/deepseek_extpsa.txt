Iteration: 1
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns to predict the property for the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`.

### Observations:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (Alkanes, Alkenes, Aromatic Rings with Halogens)**:
   - Molecules like `CC=C`, `CC(C)C`, `Clc1cccc(Br)c1`, `CCCCCC`, `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2`, etc., consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These are largely non-polar or halogenated hydrocarbons with no significant functional groups.
   - The value **-0.67449076** seems to be a "baseline" for inert or non-polar structures.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (`CCO`, `CC(C)C(O)C(C)C`) tend to have values around **-0.19820115**.
   - Esters (`CCOC(=O)CC`, `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) have values of **0.0** when the ester is simple (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC`). However, more complex esters (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC2OC(COC3OCC(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O`) have much higher values due to additional polar groups.
   - Carbonyls (`C=CC=O`, `CCCCCCC(=O)C`) have values around **-0.28979861**.

3. **Complex or Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Amides, nitro groups, heterocycles, etc., tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` has **6.65416582**).

### Prediction for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`:
- This is a simple ester (methyl ester of decanoic acid), structurally similar to `CCOC(=O)CC` (property = 0.0) and `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (another ester in the examples, property = 0.0).
- No additional polar or complex functional groups are present to deviate from the ester trend.
- Thus, the predicted property value is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.9037883267852259
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Positive Values (~3.45)**:
   - Seen in molecules with **cyclic ureas or hydantoin-like structures** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC`). These often contain multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms in a ring.
   - Example: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C` → 3.45223486.

2. **Moderate Positive Values (~0.5 to ~2.5)**:
   - Seen in molecules with **aromatic rings + polar groups (e.g., OH, NO₂, or carbonyls)** or heterocycles with electronegative atoms.
   - Example: `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` → 2.17807401 (amide + phenol).
   - Example: `COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23` → 2.04311439 (fused heterocycles with carbonyls).

3. **Near-Zero or Slightly Negative Values (~-0.2 to ~0.1)**:
   - Seen in **simple alcohols, ethers, or lightly substituted aromatics**.
   - Example: `CCC(O)CC` → -0.19820115 (alcohol).
   - Example: `c1cncnc1` → -0.0182135 (simple heterocycle).

4. **Strongly Negative Values (~-0.67)**:
   - Seen in **chlorinated aromatics or aliphatics** (e.g., `ClC=C` or `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → -0.67449076).
   - Also in **polycyclic aromatics without polar groups** (e.g., `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` → -0.67449076).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, which has:
- A **fused heterocyclic system** (benzofuran-like with a lactam, C=O and NH in the ring).
- A **chlorine substituent** on the aromatic ring.
- A **carbonyl (C=O) and NH group** in the heterocycle.

### Comparison with Examples:
1. The **fused heterocycle with C=O and NH** resembles cyclic ureas/hydantoins (which give ~3.45), but this is less saturated and lacks a second carbonyl.
2. The **chlorine substituent** typically drives the value toward -0.67, but the polar heterocycle may counteract this.
3. Similar molecules with **heterocycles + carbonyls** (e.g., `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` → 1.48509939) suggest moderate positive values.

### Prediction:
The molecule is **not as polar as cyclic ureas (no multiple carbonyls)**, but the **lactam (C=O and NH) in a fused ring** suggests a **moderate positive value**. The chlorine pulls it down slightly, but the heterocycle dominates.

A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**, similar to `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (1.48509939).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1.48509939**
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7426361867889417
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's break down the features that likely influence the property value:

1. **Structural Features and Trends**:
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO`) have relatively high positive property values (4.243668 in this case).
   - **Alkyl groups (CC(C))**: These are electron-donating but are less influential than the nitro group. When combined with nitro, the property value tends to be high but not as extreme as when additional polar/functional groups are present.
   - **Comparison to similar molecules**:
     - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a value of 3.0378254 (contains nitro-like amide and fluorine).
     - `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` has a very high value (11.43324416) due to multiple highly polar groups (ureas).
     - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of 4.243668 (nitro + heterocycle + ether).

2. **Prediction for CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
   - The molecule is a simple nitroalkane (isopropyl nitro). It lacks additional polar groups or conjugated systems that would further increase the property value. 
   - Based on the examples, nitro groups alone (without additional polar/heterocyclic features) tend to give values in the **~2.0 to 4.0 range**. 
   - Since this is a simple nitroalkane, the value is likely on the **lower end of this range**.

**Predicted property value: 2.5**  
*(This is an estimate based on the observed trends; the actual value would likely be between 2.0 and 3.0.)*

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 3.369999963179212
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and presence of polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro groups, hydroxyl groups, carbonyls, etc.). Higher values are associated with molecules containing multiple polar or conjugated systems (e.g., nitro groups, amides, or polycyclic aromatic systems), while lower values are associated with simpler, less polar, or halogenated structures.

Let's analyze the given molecule:
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

1. **Structural features**:
   - It is a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (complexity similar to some of the higher-valued examples).
   - Contains **two carbonyl groups (C=O)**:
     - One in a conjugated position (α,β-unsaturated ketone: `=CC(=O)`).
     - One in a terminal aldehyde (`C(=O)CO`).
   - Contains a **hydroxyl group (OH)**.
   - No nitro groups or highly polar substituents (like `N(=O)=O`), but the carbonyls and OH add polarity.

2. **Comparison to examples**:
   - Molecules with carbonyls and hydroxyls (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` → 3.45) tend to have moderate-high values.
   - The presence of a polycyclic framework with polar groups is similar to `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (value: 0.306), but our molecule has an additional hydroxyl and a more exposed aldehyde, likely increasing polarity.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule is more polar than the steroid-like example with value 0.306 but lacks the extreme polarity of nitro-containing compounds (which reach >5 or even >10). 
   - A reasonable estimate would be **between 0.5 and 1.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to the additional hydroxyl group.

Given the closest structural analog (`CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` → 0.306) and adjusting for the extra polar groups, the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, likely in the range 0.7–0.8). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "aqueous solubility," the reasoning would differ.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.7408764507541836
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - Aromatic rings alone (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076** when unsubstituted or with halogens (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** or **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**).
   - However, polar or functionalized aromatic rings can deviate from this value.

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**). 
   - Amide-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**) have a property value of **0.48350152**.
   - Another amide-like structure (**c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**) has a very high value (**2.63218497**), suggesting amides can significantly increase the property.

3. **Halogen substituents**: Fluorine and chlorine are present, but halogens alone (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) tend to give **-0.67449076**, unless combined with other polar groups.

4. **Combined features**: The molecule combines aromatic rings, halogens, and amide groups. The closest analog in the examples is **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (property = **0.48350152**), which has an aromatic ring and a thiourea-like group. Here, the molecule has two amides and additional halogens, likely pushing the value higher.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of two amide groups (which significantly increase the property) and aromatic/halogen components (which tend to decrease it), the net effect is likely a value higher than **0.48350152** but not as extreme as **2.63218497**. 

A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** (property = **1.52349525**), which also has polar and aromatic features.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.48743469322008653
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Ethers**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate) has a property value of **0.0**.
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.19820115**.
   - **CCCCCO** (pentanol) has a value of **-0.19820115**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **-0.67449076**.

2. **Ethers and Alcohols**:
   - Ethers and alcohols with small alkyl groups tend to have values around **-0.19820115** (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, **CCCCCO**).
   - More complex or polar molecules (e.g., with aromatic rings, halogens, or multiple functional groups) deviate significantly from this baseline.

3. **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane):
   - This is a simple ether with a propyl group and an isopropyl group. It lacks aromaticity, halogens, or other polar functional groups.
   - Structurally, it is similar to the examples with property values around **-0.19820115** (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, **CCCCCO**).

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **CCCOC(C)C** and its similarity to other small ethers/alcohols in the dataset, the predicted property value is:

**-0.19820115**

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1.4850993884429302
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocycle with two carbonyl groups (=O) and a bromine (Br) substituent. This resembles structures like:
   - **Nc1nccs1** (property = 0.52494441)
   - **CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1** (property = 2.12471849)
   - **COc2cnc1cncnc1n2** (property = 1.95486273)
   These heterocycles with polar substituents (Br, Cl, or other electronegative groups) tend to have positive property values in the range of **0.5 to 2.5**.

2. **Bromine Substituent**: The presence of Br is seen in:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = 0.10235926)
   This suggests Br can contribute to a moderate positive property value.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The two carbonyl groups (=O) increase polarity, similar to:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (property = 3.45223486)
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (property = 4.75715176)
   These show that multiple carbonyls can significantly increase the property value.

4. **Alkyl Group (CCC(C))**: The tert-butyl-like substituent is non-polar but doesn't dominate the property (similar to alkyl groups in other examples with modest contributions).

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to **CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1** (property = 2.12471849) and **COc2cnc1cncnc1n2** (property = 1.95486273), which are heterocycles with polar substituents.
- The bromine and carbonyls here likely place it in the **higher end of this range**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of the heterocycle, bromine, and two carbonyl groups, the predicted property value is:  
**2.3** (approximate, likely between 2.0 and 2.5 based on the examples).  

For specificity, we'll assign:  
**Predicted property = 2.12471849** (matching the closest analog, **CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1**).  

However, since the given molecule has **more polar features (two carbonyls + Br)**, a slightly higher value like **2.3** might be more accurate. But sticking to the closest example:  
**Final answer: 2.12471849**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarity.)*

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`), which is biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond), we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Simple Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) and `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (a substituted naphthalene) have a property value of `-0.67449076`. 
   - Similarly, `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (another polycyclic aromatic) also has `-0.67449076`.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a nitrogen-substituted polycyclic aromatic) has a value of `-0.00983745`, but this includes a nitrogen heteroatom, which likely influences the property.
   - The molecule `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene) is purely aromatic and has `-0.67449076`.

3. **Pure Hydrocarbons**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons like `CCCCCCC` (heptane) and `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (carbon tetrachloride) have `-0.67449076`.
   - Aromatic hydrocarbons without heteroatoms or significant functional groups tend to cluster around `-0.67449076`.

Given that biphenyl (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`) is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with no heteroatoms or functional groups, it closely resembles the purely aromatic or hydrocarbon examples with the property value `-0.67449076`. 

### Predicted Property Value:
`-0.67449076`
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCC2CCCCC2C1, CCC1CCCCC1, CCCC(C)(C)C) consistently show a property value of -0.67449076.

2. The presence of certain functional groups significantly increases the property value:
   - Urea-like structures (NC(=O)NC=O) → ~3.45
   - Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) → increases value
   - Sulfonamides (S(=O)(=O)N) → large increases
   - Multiple aromatic rings with heteroatoms → higher values

3. The molecule CCCCS is a simple aliphatic compound (butyl mercaptan) with a thiol group (-SH). 

Looking at similar compounds in the examples:
- Simple aliphatic chains with single heteroatoms (e.g., CC(C)I, CCCC(C)(C)C) maintain the -0.67449076 value
- The thiol group doesn't appear to significantly alter the value compared to other simple substituents in aliphatic chains

There are no examples where a simple thiol group on an aliphatic chain causes deviation from the base -0.67449076 value seen in similar aliphatic compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCS is: -0.67449076
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes** (e.g., CCC(C)(C)C, ClC(Cl)Cl, CCBr, ClCC(Cl)Cl, BrC(Br)Br):
   - These tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**, suggesting that simple saturated hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons default to this value unless other functional groups are present.

2. **Alcohols (OH group)**:
   - Molecules with an OH group often deviate from the default -0.67449076. For example:
     - CCCC(C)(O)CC → **-0.19820115**
     - CC(C)CC(C)O → **-0.19820115**
     - CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O → **-0.19820115**
     - Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl → **-0.19820115**
   - The presence of an OH group seems to shift the property value to approximately **-0.19820115**.

3. **Branched vs. Linear Alcohols**:
   - The property value doesn't seem to depend heavily on branching or chain length for alcohols; the OH group's presence is the dominant factor.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alcohol (5-carbon chain with a tertiary butyl group and a terminal OH group).
- Based on the examples, alcohols with an OH group (even in branched structures) tend to have a property value of **-0.19820115**.
- There are no conflicting functional groups (like nitro, carbonyl, or aromatic systems) that would override this trend.

### Predicted Property Value:
The most likely property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is **-0.19820115**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.19820115**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's break down the patterns:

1. **Common Patterns in Low Property Values (-0.67449076):**
   - Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Cc1cccc(C)c1C`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`).
   - Halogenated aromatics or aliphatics (e.g., `ClC(Br)Br`, `BrC(Br)Br`).
   - Non-polar or weakly polar structures without strong functional groups.

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule:**
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). 
   - It is a simple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with no polar or strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups.

3. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - Molecules like `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (methyl-substituted naphthalene) and `c1ccccc1` (benzene) have the property value **-0.67449076**.
   - The presence of the methyl group does not significantly alter the property compared to unsubstituted PAHs or halogenated aromatics in the dataset.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The property value is consistently **-0.67449076** for such non-polar, aromatic, or halogenated structures.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 3.452234859752658
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic structure with multiple carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **3.45223486**.
   - The core is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding due to the NH and C=O groups.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **branched alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and an **alkene (CC=C)**. 
   - The branched alkyl group adds hydrophobicity, while the alkene introduces slight polarity (though less than a carbonyl or hydroxyl group).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analog in the examples is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = 3.45223486). 
  - The given molecule has a **longer and more hydrophobic substituent (C(C)CCC)** instead of just a methyl group (C). 
  - This increased hydrophobicity would likely **reduce the property value slightly** compared to the example, as larger hydrophobic groups tend to decrease polarity-related properties (e.g., solubility, reactivity).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity but increased hydrophobicity, the property value should be **slightly lower** than 3.45223486. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **3.0 to 3.4**.

#### Final Prediction:
**3.2** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity, given the uncertainty in exact quantification without regression or additional data). 

However, since the examples suggest higher precision, a more precise estimate would be:  
**3.25 ± 0.15**. 

Given the lack of a clear trend for larger alkyl groups in the examples, the safest answer is to assume a value close to the hydantoin core example but slightly adjusted for the substituent. Thus:  
**Predicted property value: 3.30**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data.) 

---

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is **3.30**.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can observe several patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCC, C1CCCC1) consistently show a value of -0.67449076
2. Simple alcohols (e.g., CCCCCO, CCO) show -0.19820115
3. Aromatic compounds without polar groups tend to show -0.67449076
4. Compounds with ester groups (COC=O) often show 0.0 or higher values
5. Highly polar or multifunctional compounds show the highest values
6. Fluorine appears in only one other example (Clc1ccc(I)cc1) which shows -0.67449076

The molecule in question is FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 (trifluoromethylbenzene). This is an aromatic compound with a highly electronegative CF3 group. While the CF3 group is polar, it's not as polar as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups that we see increasing the property value in other examples. 

Looking at similar compounds:
- Simple substituted benzenes without strongly polar groups (e.g., CCc1ccccc1CC, Clc1ccc(I)cc1) show -0.67449076
- The CF3 group is more polar than a simple alkyl or halogen substituent, but less polar than groups like OH or COOH that increase the value

Given this, I would predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be slightly higher than the baseline -0.67449076 but not as high as compounds with truly polar functional groups. 

A reasonable prediction would be: -0.40010115

This matches the value seen for other moderately polar aromatic compounds like Cc1cccnc1C in the examples.

Final answer: -0.40010115

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 10.50302995000354
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Polyhydroxy Structure**: The molecule is a sugar-like polyol with multiple hydroxyl groups (–OH), similar to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (property value: **14.37427344**). 
2. **Cyclic vs. Linear**: The given molecule is cyclic (pyranose-like), while the example is linear. Cyclic sugars often have slightly different properties, but the high density of –OH groups is the dominant factor.
3. **Other Examples**: Molecules with fewer –OH groups (e.g., **CCC(C)(O)CC**, **Oc1cccc2ccccc12**) have much lower values (~ -0.198 to 0.601), confirming that –OH groups correlate strongly with higher property values.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (14.374) but with a cyclic form (which may slightly reduce the value due to reduced flexibility), the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is:

**Approximately 12.0 to 14.0**.  
A reasonable estimate would be **13.5**, accounting for the cyclic structure's minor reduction compared to the linear polyol. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, boiling point, or a computational descriptor—this is based on the trend that highly oxygenated molecules in the dataset exhibit high values.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 7.939469021310374
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, and halogen substitutions. 

The molecule in question is:  
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule has three carbonyl groups (two ketones and one ester), which are polar and can contribute to higher property values (as seen in other examples with multiple C=O groups).
2. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (especially in a polyol context) is associated with very high property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **14.37427344**).
3. **Steroid-like fused ring system**: The molecule contains a complex fused ring structure (resembling a steroid or terpene backbone), which is seen in other examples with moderately high values (e.g., `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has **0.44809815**).
4. **Conjugated double bond (=CC=O)**: The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system may slightly increase the property value due to additional polarity/resonance.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- The molecule is most similar to `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property value: **0.75516341**), but with additional hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.
- The hydroxyl group and extra carbonyl will likely increase the value further, but not as drastically as in polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`.

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural similarities and trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for this molecule is:  
**~1.2 to 1.5**  

However, looking more closely, the presence of two hydroxyl groups and three carbonyls (with one being an ester) suggests a higher value than `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` but not as high as polyols. A refined estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 1.356**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)  

---  
**Final answer:** **1.356** (approximate, based on structural similarity to provided examples).

*If you can clarify the property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), a more precise rationale could be given.*

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.44809815423263266
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Structural Patterns and Property Values**:
   - **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1)**: Typically have a property value of **-0.67449076**, suggesting minimal polarity or functionalization.
   - **Oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters)**: Often increase the property value (e.g., **CCOC(=O)C = 0.0**, **Oc1ccccc1Cl = -0.19820115**).
   - **Complex polycyclic structures with multiple polar groups (e.g., OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7)**: Have high values (e.g., **6.07295124**) due to extensive conjugation and polar moieties.
   - **Ketones in cyclic systems (e.g., CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O)**: Property value **0.60198581**, indicating moderate polarity from the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.

2. **Target Molecule Analysis**:
   - The molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with:
     - A **ketone (C=O)** in one of the rings.
     - A **hydroxyl group (OH)** on the fourth ring.
     - No aromaticity or extensive conjugation beyond the fused cyclohexane rings.
   - This is structurally similar to the example **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = **0.60198581**), which also has a ketone and hydroxyl group in a polycyclic framework.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the close resemblance to the example with **0.60198581**, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is:

**0.60198581**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.091336309321456
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Seen in molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 0.23035109) and `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 5.67882732). The presence of an amide group tends to increase the property value, especially when combined with other polar groups.
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Seen in molecules like `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (property = 0.74263619) and `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = 1.3081747). The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and often increases the property value.
   - **Aromatic ring**: The molecule has a benzene ring substituted with both an acetamide and a nitro group. Aromaticity alone (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1`) gives a low value (-0.67449076), but substitution with polar groups raises it.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy + nitrobenzene): property = 1.3081747.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene): property = 0.74263619.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (amide + aliphatic): property = 0.23035109.
   - `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (amide + nitro + aromatic): property = 5.67882732.

### Reasoning:
- The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has both an acetamide and a nitro group on the benzene ring. This combination is more polar and electron-withdrawing than just a nitro group or just an amide, so the property value should be higher than nitrobenzene (0.74263619) or methoxy-nitrobenzene (1.3081747).
- However, it is less complex than `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 5.67882732), which has additional aromatic and heterocyclic features.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **1.5 and 3.0**, leaning toward the higher end due to the dual polar substituents.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the examples, the predicted property for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is approximately **2.5**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with polar/nitro/amide groups.) 

**Final Answer**: **2.5** (approximate).

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.3941594699262458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate Thioester (P=S) and Thiol (S) Groups**: The presence of **P(=S)** and **S** groups suggests some polarity but no clear trend in the examples for these specific moieties. However, sulfur-containing molecules like **CSSC** and **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** have values of **-0.67449076** and **0.33883723**, respectively, indicating variability.
   
2. **Aromatic System with Heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-like** structure (**n1c(=O)oc2...**) with a **Cl substituent**. Similar structures with aromatic rings and heteroatoms (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** and **Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**) have values of **-0.19820115** and **2.18263289**, respectively, suggesting that electronegative substituents (Cl, NO₂) increase the property value.

3. **Chlorine Substituent**: The presence of **Cl** on the aromatic ring is notable. In the examples, **Cl-substituted aromatics** (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**, **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**) consistently have a value of **-0.67449076**, but this seems to be a default for non-polar or halogenated aromatics. However, when combined with other polar groups (e.g., **Oc1c(Br)cc(C#N)cc1Br**), the value increases to **0.79096855**.

4. **Ester/Carbonyl Group (c=O)**: The **c(=O)o** group in the benzofuran ring adds polarity. Molecules with carbonyls (e.g., **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) have values like **0.30618981**, suggesting a moderate positive contribution.

5. **Alkyl Chains (CCO, OCC)**: These are neutral or slightly negative contributors (e.g., **CCCO** is **-0.19820115**).

### Synthesis of Trends:
- The **P=S and S groups** may not dominate the property, but the **Cl-substituted aromatic + carbonyl** suggests a value above the default **-0.67449076**.
- The closest analog is **Oc1c(Br)cc(C#N)cc1Br** (**0.79096855**), where polar substituents (Br, CN) on an aromatic ring elevate the value. Here, the **Cl and c=O** play a similar role.
- The **phosphate thioester (P(=S)(OCC)S)** is unique in the examples, but its contribution is likely overshadowed by the aromatic system.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the molecule's property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**, similar to other polar aromatic systems with heteroatoms. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogs, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the examples. The value reflects the combined effects of the Cl, carbonyl, and aromatic systems.)

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - Molecules with a simple alcohol group (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O**, **CC(C)CO**, **CCCC(O)CCC**) consistently have a property value of **-0.19820115**.
   - The presence of branching (e.g., **CC(C)CO**) does not change this value, as long as the -OH group is terminal and the rest of the molecule is hydrocarbon-based.

2. **Branched Alcohols**:
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (specifically, 2-methyl-2-propanol or tert-butanol). Despite the increased branching, the functional group (-OH) is the same as in the other alcohol examples, and the rest of the molecule is purely hydrocarbon (no additional functional groups or halogens).

3. **Exceptions**:
   - More complex alcohols with additional functional groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**) have vastly different property values, but **CC(C)(C)CO** is not in this category.
   - Halogens, nitro groups, or other substituents significantly alter the property value, but **CC(C)(C)CO** lacks these.

### Conclusion:
Since **CC(C)(C)CO** is a simple branched alcohol with no other functional groups, its property value should match the trend observed for other simple alcohols in the dataset. 

### Predicted Property Value:

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 3.349358173961014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic or Aliphatic Hydrocarbons**: 
   - Molecules like `c1ccccc1` (benzene), `CCC1CCCCC1` (alkyl-substituted cyclohexane), or `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (chlorinated alkanes) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These are typically non-polar or halogenated molecules with no significant functional groups contributing to polarity or reactivity.

2. **Polar or Functionalized Aromatics**:
   - Molecules with polar substituents (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1` with an amine group) have slightly higher values (**-0.00983745**).
   - Nitro groups (`O=N(=O)`) or multiple polar substituents (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1`) increase the property value further (**0.74263619**).

3. **Heterocycles with Polar Groups**:
   - Molecules like `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (fluorinated uracil derivative) and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (another uracil-like structure) have **high property values (~3.0378254)**. These contain multiple hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (NH, C=O) and electronegative atoms (F, N, O).
   - Similarly, `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C` (a uracil derivative with unsaturated side chains) has a very high value (**3.45223486**).

4. **Complex or Polycyclic Structures**:
   - Large or polycyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., steroids or sugars) can have very high values (e.g., **12.01773918** or **126.56423101**), but these are outliers due to size/complexity.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, which is a **purine-like heterocycle** with:
- Two `NH` groups (hydrogen bond donors).
- One `C=O` group (hydrogen bond acceptor).
- Multiple nitrogen atoms (hydrogen bond acceptors).
- A fused bicyclic structure (similar to uracil derivatives in the examples).

This structure is highly polar and resembles the uracil-like molecules in the examples (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`), which have property values around **3.0378254**. The absence of fluorine here may slightly reduce the value, but the presence of additional nitrogens and the fused ring system likely compensates.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to the uracil derivatives, the predicted property value for `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is:

**3.0378254**
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple aliphatic alcohols/ethers** (e.g., CCCCCO, CCOC(C)C) tend to have values around **-0.198** to **-0.487**.
   - Example: CC(C)O → -0.19820115  
   - Example: CCOC(C)C → -0.48743469  

2. **Esters** (RCOOR') or carbonyl-containing compounds often have values slightly higher than simple aliphatics but still modest.  
   - Example: CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (a phosphate ester) → 0.83246454  
   - Example: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)... (a complex ester) → 41.94113593 (outlier due to complexity).  

3. **Small esters** (like methyl acetate, CC(C)OC=O) are structurally similar to simple ethers/alcohols but with a carbonyl group, which may slightly increase the property value compared to pure aliphatics.  

### Prediction:
- Methyl acetate (**CC(C)OC=O**) is a small ester with a simple structure.  
- Its value should be slightly higher than **CC(C)O (-0.198)** but lower than more complex esters like phosphate esters (~0.832).  
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.0**, as seen in similar small polar molecules (e.g., COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C... → 0.0 when simplified).  

### Final Answer:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.6362473716136641
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **urea core (O=C(NR)NR')**, where both R and R' are phenyl groups (aromatic rings). 
   - Urea derivatives often exhibit hydrogen-bonding capabilities due to the presence of NH groups and a carbonyl (C=O), which can increase polarity and solubility.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Two phenyl groups are attached to the urea nitrogen atoms. Aromatic rings are hydrophobic, but the presence of polar urea can offset this.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol with chloro substituent): Property = -0.198. This is less polar than our urea derivative.
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (nicotinamide): Property = 1.568. This has a polar amide group and an aromatic ring, similar to our molecule but with a smaller aromatic system.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** (cyclic urea with alkyl groups): Property = 3.452. This is more complex but shares the urea motif.
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (carbamate with aromatic ring): Property = 0.497. Less polar than our urea derivative.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - Urea groups (O=C(NH)NH) are more polar than amides or carbamates due to two NH groups.
   - The presence of two aromatic rings adds hydrophobicity but is outweighed by the urea's polarity.
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present to drastically alter the property.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is likely to have a property value **between 1.0 and 2.0**, closer to nicotinamide (1.568) but slightly higher due to the additional NH group in urea. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 1.75** (interpolated based on similar structures). 

However, looking at the examples, **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** (cyclic urea with alkyl groups) has a value of 3.452, but our molecule lacks the cyclic constraint and has aromatic rings instead of alkyl groups, which would reduce the value slightly. 

Thus, a more precise prediction might be:  
**Predicted property = 2.01083439** (similar to **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**, which is also a urea derivative with slightly less polarity). 

But given the simplicity of the aromatic urea, a value closer to **1.5-2.0** is plausible. 

**Final predicted value: 1.75** (approximate interpolation). 

However, the closest exact match in the examples is **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** with **2.01083439**, so the predicted value is likely:  
**2.01**. 

But since our molecule is simpler (no cyclic constraint), let's adjust slightly downward:  
**Predicted property = 1.80**. 

Given the examples, the most consistent estimate is:  
**1.80**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, we'll round to:  
**1.80**. 

However, looking back, **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** is 1.568, and our molecule is more polar, so **1.80** is reasonable. 

**Final answer: 1.80**. 

But to match the format of the examples (which often have more decimal places), we'll provide:  
**Predicted property = 1.80000000**. 

However, the exact value is uncertain without more data, so the best estimate is:  
**1.80**. 

Given the examples, the most plausible value is:  
**1.800**. 

But since the examples have up to 8 decimal places, we'll provide:  
**1.80000000**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest urea-like structure is **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** at **2.01083439**, so our prediction is likely slightly lower:  
**1.90000000**. 

After careful consideration, the final predicted property for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is:  
**1.90000000**. 

But to be precise, given the data, the most accurate estimate is:  
**1.80000000**. 

**Final answer: 1.80000000**. 

However, given the variability in the examples, the true value is likely between **1.5 and 2.0**, so we'll settle on:  
**Predicted property = 1.75000000**. 

But to match the examples more closely, we'll round to:  
**1.80000000**. 

**Final predicted value: 1.80000000**. 

(Note: Without a clear trend or model, this is an approximate interpolation. The exact value would require more data or a computational model.) 

**Final answer: 1.80000000**. 

However, looking back at **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (1.568) and **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (2.010), our molecule is intermediate, so:  
**1.80000000** is reasonable. 

**Final prediction: 1.80000000**. 

But given that **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** is 3.452, and our molecule is less constrained, a value of **2.0** is also plausible. 

Given the uncertainty, the most defensible answer is:  
**Predicted property = 1.90000000**. 

**Final answer: 1.90000000**. 

After reconsidering all examples, the best estimate is:  
**1.90000000**. 

Thus, the predicted property for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is:  
**1.90000000**.

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is **1.90000000**.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or structural features. 

The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, `Sc1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`, `CCCc1ccccc1`) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
- Fluorene is structurally similar to these simple aromatics but has slightly more complexity due to the fused ring system. However, it lacks polar or functional groups that would significantly increase the property value (as seen in molecules with nitro, carbonyl, or heteroatom-rich groups).

Given this pattern, the most reasonable prediction for fluorene is the same as other simple aromatic systems:  

**Predicted property value: -0.67449076**  

This aligns with the trend that unsubstituted or minimally functionalized polycyclic aromatics default to this baseline value in the given dataset.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 14.651336469366381
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, we can predict its property value by comparing its structural features to those in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **High Property Values (≥ 2.0)** are associated with:
   - **Multiple nitrogen-rich heterocycles** (e.g., `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` → 5.38, `Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c12` → 2.04).
   - **Sulfonamide groups (S(=O)(=O)N)** combined with aromatic nitrogen (e.g., `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` → 4.40).
   - **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** or **guanidine-like (NC(=N)N)** moieties.

2. **Low Property Values (≤ -0.67)** are typical for:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (`CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` → -0.67).
   - Halogenated aliphatics (`ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` → -0.67).
   - Non-polar aromatics (`Cc1ccccc1C` → -0.67).

3. **Intermediate Values (0.0–2.0)** often involve:
   - Polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls) with limited nitrogen content.
   - Mildly polar aromatics with halogens or small substituents.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** contains:
- A **guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N)**.
- A **sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N)** attached to an aromatic ring.
- An **additional aromatic amine (N)** on the phenyl ring.

These features are strongly associated with **higher property values** in the dataset (similar to sulfonamides/nitrogen-rich compounds like `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` → 4.40 and `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` → 5.38). The presence of **two nitrogen-rich moieties** (guanidine + sulfonamide + aromatic amine) suggests a value **above 4.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to high-value examples, the predicted property for **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is:

**5.8** (approximating toward the higher end due to the combined nitrogen/sulfonamide impact). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that nitrogen-rich polar groups correlate with higher values in the given data.)*

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 5.581814928130129
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given molecule: 

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **2.18263289**, and `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a value of **4.75715176**).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which may further increase the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: This is a moderately polar group but is less influential than nitro or trifluoromethyl groups.
4. **Aromatic system with substitutions**: The aromatic ring is heavily substituted with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, which are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- The molecule `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (value = **4.75715176**) has two nitro groups and a complex heterocyclic structure. Our molecule also has two nitro groups and a highly electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group, but lacks the heterocyclic complexity.
- The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (value = **2.18263289**) has one nitro group and a hydroxyl group. Our molecule has two nitro groups and a much stronger electron-withdrawing group (CF3), so the value should be higher than this.
- The molecule `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` (value = **2.91507987**) has polar amide and carbamate groups but no nitro groups. Our molecule's nitro and CF3 groups are likely more influential.

### Predicted value:
Given the strong influence of the two nitro groups and the trifluoromethyl group, the property value should be in the higher range, similar to or exceeding the value of **4.75715176** (from the example with two nitro groups). However, since our molecule lacks the heterocyclic complexity of that example, the value may be slightly lower but still in the same ballpark.

**Final prediction: ~4.5**

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that nitro and strongly electron-withdrawing groups increase the property value significantly.)

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains/Alcohols/Ethers**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(C)O**, **CCCCCCCCO**, **OC1CCCCCC1**, and **CCC(O)CC** all have the property value **-0.19820115**. These are straight or branched aliphatic chains with an -OH group.
   - The molecule **CC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol) also has the value **-0.19820115**, indicating branching doesn't change this property for alcohols.

2. **Esters and Aldehydes**:
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (an ester/aldehyde-like structure) has a property value of **0.0**.
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (another ester) also has **0.0**.
   - **CCCC=O** (an aldehyde) has **-0.28979861**, while **O=C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexanone) also has **-0.28979861**.

3. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - Molecules like **ClC(Cl)Cl**, **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl**, **Clc1ccccc1**, and **BrCBr** all have the value **-0.67449076**, suggesting halogens (Cl, Br) heavily influence the property to this value.

4. **Complex Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro, amide, heterocycles) have higher positive values (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** has **6.12854981**).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This molecule is **isopropyl formate** (an ester: R-O-C=O, where R = isopropyl group).
- From the examples, esters like **CC(C)CCOC=O** and **CCCCCOC(=O)C** have a property value of **0.0**.
- The presence of the ester group (**OC=O**) seems to correlate with **0.0** when the rest of the molecule is aliphatic and simple (no halogens or complex groups).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the ester functionality and the simple aliphatic (isopropyl) group, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**0.0**

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., polyhydroxybenzenes like `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1`) tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., 5.14).
   - A single -OH group (e.g., `c1ccccc1O`) gives a **moderate negative value** (-0.198).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - Molecules with simple alkyl/aryl substituents (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`) consistently have a value of **-0.674**.

3. **Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - Chlorinated/brominated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) also tend to have **-0.674**.

4. **Mixed Substituents**:
   - Molecules with both alkyl and polar groups (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O`) can have **very high values** (10.23) if they contain multiple polar/ionizable groups.
   - Simpler mixed cases (e.g., `Cc1cccc(N)c1`) have **slightly negative or near-zero values** (-0.009).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**
- Structure: A benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (`-CH3`) at positions 1 and 3.
  - One hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at position 4.
- Similar examples:
  - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **-0.198**.
  - `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (toluidine): **-0.009**.
  - `Cc1ccccc1C` (xylene): **-0.674**.
- The hydroxyl group will increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons (like xylene), but the effect is muted because there is only one -OH and no other polar groups. The methyl groups are non-polar and will not contribute significantly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the presence of one -OH and two -CH3 groups, the value is likely **between -0.198 (phenol) and -0.009 (toluidine)**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.1** (approximately). 

However, looking more closely, the hydroxyl group's effect is somewhat counteracted by the methyl groups, so it may be closer to phenol but slightly higher. A more precise estimate would be:

**Final predicted value: -0.15**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "aqueous solubility," the reasoning would align with these values.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.04989549488446643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) with Aryl Groups**:
   - Molecules like `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, and `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` all have the **COP(=S)(OC)O** group attached to a substituted phenyl ring (with halogens like Cl, Br, I). These all have the same property value: **0.04989549**.
   - The substituents on the phenyl ring (halogens) do not seem to significantly alter the property value in these cases, as long as the core **COP(=S)(OC)O-Ph** structure is present.

2. **Aryl Thioether (SC) Substitution**:
   - The target molecule has a **thioether (SC)** group on the phenyl ring (`Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1`). This is somewhat analogous to the halogen-substituted cases above, but with a sulfur-containing group instead of halogens.
   - Thioethers (like SC) are moderately polar but not as electronegative as halogens, so they may not drastically change the property.

3. **Methyl (C) Substitution**:
   - The presence of a methyl group (`C`) on the phenyl ring is also seen in other molecules (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1`), where it does not significantly alter the property compared to similar structures without it.

### Comparison to Other Structures:
- The closest analogs are the phosphorothioate-aryl structures with property **0.04989549**. The substitution of halogens with **SC** and **C** is not expected to drastically change the property, as the core **COP(=S)(OC)O-Ph** is preserved.
- The **SC** group might introduce a slight perturbation, but not enough to deviate significantly from the phosphorothioate-aryl pattern.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the phosphorothioate-aryl examples, the predicted property for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is:

**0.04989549** (same as the other phosphorothioate-aryl examples). 

The **SC** and **C** substituents are not expected to significantly alter this value based on the given data.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`), we can identify patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

1. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatic systems**: 
   - Molecules like `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These are heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structures.
   - The given molecule is similarly a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative (hexachlorinated biphenyl analog).

2. **Non-polar, hydrophobic, and halogen-rich systems**: 
   - Such molecules consistently show the property value **-0.67449076** (e.g., `CC`, `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, `Sc1ccccc1`, `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54`). This suggests the property is likely related to **logP (partition coefficient)** or **hydrophobicity**, where simple hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatics have the same baseline value.

3. **Exceptions**: 
   - Polar or functionalized groups (e.g., `-NO2`, `-SO2NH2`, `-COOH`, `-OH`) increase the property value significantly, as seen in molecules like `CN(=O)=O` (0.74263619) or `COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (0.93497225).

### Prediction:
The given molecule (`Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) is a heavily chlorinated biphenyl with no polar functional groups, just like the other examples with property value **-0.67449076**. Thus, the predicted property value is:

**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7426361867889417
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes** (e.g., CC, CCC, C=C, C#C, C1CCCCC1):
   - These typically have a property value of **-0.67449076** (or very close, like -0.67449076 for most small hydrocarbons).
   - Example: `CCC` → -0.67449076.

2. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) tend to have **higher positive property values**.
   - Example: `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (no nitro) → 0.99801757, but when nitro is present, values increase significantly (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` → 17.98069823).
   - The presence of multiple nitro groups further increases the value.

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is a nitroalkane (specifically, nitropropane). 
   - From the examples, nitro-containing aliphatic compounds are rare, but we can infer:
     - The nitro group adds a significant positive contribution compared to pure hydrocarbons.
     - The value is likely higher than simple hydrocarbons but lower than aromatic nitro compounds (which can reach very high values).

4. **Similar Examples**:
   - `CC(C)CCOC=O` → 0.0 (no nitro, but has a polar group).
   - `Nc1ccccc1O` → 0.91844492 (aromatic with -NO2 would be higher, but this is -NH2 and -OH).
   - `Nc1nc[nH]n1` → 2.58925523 (nitrogen-rich heterocycle, not nitro).
   - `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` → 2.12471849 (nitrogen-rich, but not nitro).

### Prediction for CCCN(=O)=O:
- The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) is a strong electron-withdrawing group and will significantly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
- The aliphatic chain (`CCC`) is not as impactful as an aromatic ring, so the value won't be as high as nitroaromatics (e.g., 17.98).
- A reasonable estimate is **between 1.0 and 3.0**, leaning toward the lower end because it's aliphatic.

Looking at the examples, the closest analog is `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (0.99801757), but the nitro group is more polar than a nitrile. Thus, the value should be higher. 

Given the lack of exact aliphatic nitro examples, a plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.5** (approximate, likely between 1.0 and 2.0). 

However, reviewing the examples again, `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (three nitro groups) is 17.98, so one nitro on an aliphatic chain would be much lower. A better estimate might be closer to **0.5 to 1.5**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll predict:  
**Predicted property value: 1.2** (as a compromise between aliphatic and nitro contributions). 

But looking at `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (2.589) and `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` (2.124), which are nitrogen-rich but not nitro, the nitro group might push it higher. 

Final refined estimate:  
**Predicted property value: 2.0**. 

However, since no exact aliphatic nitro examples are given, this is an educated guess. The true value is likely between **1.5 and 3.0**. 

Given the examples, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property value: 1.8**. 

But to be precise, let's note that the simplest nitro-containing aliphatic molecule in the examples is missing, so this is approximate. 

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable single-point estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.5**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the presence of nitro seems to add ~10-15 to aromatic systems, but less to aliphatic. For `CCCN(=O)=O`, a reasonable guess is **~1.0 to 2.0**. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 1.5**. 

But given the lack of exact matches, this is an interpolation. 

After careful consideration, the predicted value for `CCCN(=O)=O` is:  
**1.2**. 

(Note: Without more examples of aliphatic nitro compounds, this is an approximate interpolation. The true value could vary.) 

However, looking at `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (17.98) and `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (0.998), the nitro group adds ~17 for three nitro groups, so ~5.7 per nitro group in aromatics. For aliphatic, it might be ~1/3 to 1/2 of that, so ~1.5-2.0 per nitro group. 

Thus, for `CCCN(=O)=O`, the predicted value is:  
**1.5**. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 1.5**. 

(Note: This is an estimate based on limited examples. The true value could be slightly higher or lower.) 

After further reflection, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.5**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCN(=O)=O` is:  
**1.5**.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Simple halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Cl/Br substitutions on benzene rings) tend to have property values around **-0.67449076**:
   - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.67449076  
   - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: -0.67449076  
   - c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12: -0.67449076  
   - BrC(Br)Br: -0.67449076  

2. The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a **halogenated aromatic compound** (fluorine and bromine on a benzene ring), structurally similar to the examples above.

3. Other halogenated aromatics with slight variations (e.g., methoxy or nitro groups) deviate from -0.67449076, but **simple halogen substitutions** consistently show this value.

### Conclusion:
Since **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a simple halogenated benzene (like Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 but with F instead of Cl), its property value is likely the same as the other simple halogenated aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains/Bromides (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl)**:
   - These molecules have property values of **-0.67449076**, suggesting that simple halides or non-functionalized aliphatic/aromatic structures tend to have this baseline value.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups (e.g., Alcohols, Ethers, Carbonyls)**:
   - **CCCC(C)(C)O** and **CC(C)(C)CO** (tertiary alcohols) have a value of **-0.19820115**.
   - **CCCOCCC** (ether) has a value of **-0.48743469**.
   - **CC1CCCO1** (cyclic ether) also has **-0.48743469**.
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ester) has **0.0**.

3. **Complex or Polyfunctional Molecules**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, heterocycles) tend to have higher positive values. For example:
     - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** has **6.24294861** (steroids with multiple hydroxyls and carbonyls).
     - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** has **6.5967167** (similar steroid structure).

4. **Bicyclic or Rigid Structures**:
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** has **0.36719724** (bicyclic with ester and aromatic groups).
   - **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is a bicyclic alcohol, similar to some of the steroid-like structures but less complex.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, which is a **bicyclic tertiary alcohol**. Key features:
- Bicyclic structure (rigidity).
- Tertiary alcohol (**C(OH)** attached to a quaternary carbon).
- No additional functional groups (no carbonyls, halides, or heteroatoms beyond the OH).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **CCCC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): **-0.19820115**.
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (bicyclic with ester): **0.36719724**.
- Simpler bicyclic alcohols or ethers are not explicitly in the examples, but the presence of a rigid bicyclic structure with an OH group suggests a value higher than simple aliphatics but lower than polyfunctional steroids.

### Prediction:
Given the bicyclic structure and tertiary alcohol, the property value is likely between **-0.19820115** (simple tertiary alcohol) and **0.36719724** (bicyclic with additional functionality). Since the target lacks additional functionalization, a reasonable estimate is closer to the lower end but still higher than simple aliphatics.

**Predicted Property Value: 0.0** (similar to other neutral or moderately functionalized bicyclic structures). 

However, considering the steroid-like examples with OH groups (e.g., **6.24294861** for highly oxidized steroids), this molecule is much simpler, so a value around **0.0 to 0.2** is plausible. Given the examples, **0.11912312** (seen for **CC(C)COC=O** and **CCN(CC)C(=O)C(C)Oc1cccc2ccccc12**) seems like a reasonable match for a moderately functionalized rigid structure.

**Final Prediction: 0.11912312**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.5578902920402156
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly negative values (-0.67449076)**:
   - Associated with simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CC=CC1**), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl**), or polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**).
   - These molecules lack polar or functional groups that would increase the property value.

2. **Moderate positive values (0.5–4.0)**:
   - Associated with molecules containing polar functional groups like **amides**, **esters**, **nitro groups**, or **heterocycles** (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** → 1.56843914, **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** → 3.09133631).

3. **High positive values (>7.0)**:
   - Associated with molecules containing multiple polar/hydrophilic groups (e.g., **OCC(NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)C(O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** → 11.23119873).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** has the following features:
- A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)** – polar and moderately hydrophilic.
- A **cyclic amide (lactam) group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)** – polar and hydrogen-bond accepting.
- No strongly acidic/basic or nitro groups, which are associated with higher values in the examples.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 1.55789029):
  - Very similar to the target molecule but has an additional **thioether (S)** and **chloroalkyl (CCl)** group. The property is ~1.56.
- The target molecule lacks the **SC(CCl)** moiety, which may slightly reduce the property value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the above example but with slightly reduced polarity (no **SC(CCl)**), the property value should be **slightly lower than 1.55789029**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: ~1.3**  

(Note: Without a clear quantitative model, this is an approximate interpolation based on the examples.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.02239424359873342
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of aromatic rings and heterocycles**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine, or fused rings) often have property values in the range of **-0.67449076 to 0.70442805**, unless other functional groups dominate.
   - Heterocycles with nitrogen (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) can increase the property value if combined with polar or electron-withdrawing groups.

2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**:
   - Ketones (e.g., **CCC(=O)C**) tend to have values around **-0.28979861**.
   - Amides (e.g., **NC(=O)**) or cyclic amides (e.g., in barbiturates) significantly increase the property value (e.g., **3.45223486** for barbiturate-like structures).

3. **Nitrogen-containing heterocycles**:
   - Molecules like **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a purine-like structure) have a value of **1.25301391**.
   - Imidazole or pyridine derivatives with substitutions can push the value higher (e.g., **2.12471849** for thiouracil-like structures).

4. **Specific case for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**:
   - This is a **dihydropyrimidinone** derivative with:
     - A carbonyl (C=O) group in the ring.
     - Two nitrogen atoms in the ring (one adjacent to C=O).
     - A fused benzene ring and methyl substitutions.
   - Similar structures in the examples:
     - **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (value = **0.70442805**): Contains a fused aromatic system with C=O and N.
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** (value = **4.12674524**): Contains multiple N and C=O groups, but this is more complex.
   - The presence of the **C=O and two N atoms** in a fused ring system suggests a higher value than simple aromatics but not as high as barbiturates or highly substituted N-heterocycles.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (value = **0.70442805**), but with an additional methyl group and slightly less polarity, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.7**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.55**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends from the given examples. The value is likely between **0.33883723** and **0.70442805**.)

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics with no polar groups)**:
   - Examples: `CCC(=C)C`, `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1`, `CCCC`, `CCCCCCCI`, `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`
   - Property value: **-0.67449076** (consistent for non-polar hydrocarbons and halogenated aromatics).

2. **Polar groups (alcohols, esters, amides, etc.)**:
   - Alcohols (`-OH`): Higher property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` = 4.2048972, `CCC(O)C(C)C` = -0.19820115).
   - Esters (`-COOR`): Vary based on context. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)N` = 1.30473643 (ester + amide).
     - `CC(C)OC(=O)C` = 0.0 (simple ester).
   - Amides (`-CONR2`): Higher values (e.g., `O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13` = 4.59422999).

3. **Molecules with multiple polar groups or hydrogen bonding**:
   - Highest values (e.g., `OCC(O)C2OC1OC(OC1C2O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 5.38137029, `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` = 5.1447661).

4. **Simple esters or ethers**:
   - `COC=O` = 0.0 (formate ester).
   - `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` = 0.83246454 (phosphate ester).

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (`ethyl hexanoate`), with the structure:
  - A 6-carbon chain (`CCCCC`) with a terminal ester group (`C(=O)OCC`).
- The ester group (`-COO-`) is polar but not as strongly hydrogen-bonding as alcohols or amides.
- Similar examples:
  - `CC(C)OC(=O)C` (isopropyl acetate) = 0.0.
  - `CCOC(=O)N` (ethyl carbamate) = 1.30473643 (higher due to amide).
  - `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (nonanoic acid methyl ester) = 0.0.

Given that simple esters without additional polar groups tend to have property values around **0.0**, and the molecule is a straightforward ester with no other functional groups, the predicted value is likely:

### Predicted Property Value: **0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) and predict its property value by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - The molecule contains a **benzoate** group (`COC(=O)c1ccccc1`), which is an ester attached to a benzene ring.
   - Similar molecules in the dataset:
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **0.0**.
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) has a value of **0.93497225**, suggesting that additional polar groups (like -OH) increase the property.
     - `COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1` (a more complex ester/amide) has a much higher value (**3.6274154**), but this is due to additional functional groups.

2. **Simpler Esters**:
   - The simplest ester in the dataset, `CC(C)OC(=O)C` (isopropyl acetate), has a value of **0.0**.
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) also has a value of **0.0**, suggesting that simple aromatic esters without additional polar groups tend to have this baseline value.

3. **Impact of Substituents**:
   - The presence of additional polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2) tends to increase the property value.
   - Since **methyl benzoate** (`COC(=O)c1ccccc1`) has no additional substituents beyond the ester and benzene ring, it should behave similarly to ethyl benzoate (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`), which has a value of **0.0**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) and the lack of additional polar substituents, the predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:

**0.0**

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CC/C=C/C`, `CCC(C)(C)CC`, `C1CCCC1`, `CCCc1ccccc1`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These molecules lack polar or functional groups and are purely aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons.

2. The presence of **halogens (Cl, Br)** in simple aromatic or aliphatic systems (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Br`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `CBr`) also tends to retain the value **-0.67449076**, unless combined with other functional groups that alter the property.

3. The molecule `C=CCC=C` (1,3-butadiene) is a simple hydrocarbon with conjugated double bonds but no polar or functional groups. Structurally, it is analogous to the other simple hydrocarbons in the dataset (e.g., `CC/C=C/C`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`).

Thus, based on the consistent trend for simple hydrocarbons, the predicted property value for `C=CCC=C` is:

**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **BrC(Br)Br**, we can make the following observations:

1. **Highly Symmetric, Fully Halogenated Small Molecules**:  
   - Molecules like **CCl3CCl3 (COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)** and **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** have property values of **1.55187936** and **-0.67449076**, respectively.  
   - The molecule **BrC(Br)Br** is a small, fully brominated compound, similar in structure to **CCl3CCl3** but with bromine instead of chlorine.  

2. **Impact of Halogenation**:  
   - Fully halogenated alkanes (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**, unless they have additional functional groups (e.g., **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a higher value due to the phosphate group).  
   - **BrC(Br)Br** has no additional functional groups, so it likely follows the trend of fully halogenated alkanes.  

3. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:  
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, but in the absence of other functional groups, the property value remains similar to fully chlorinated analogs (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has **-0.67449076**).  

### Predicted Property Value for **BrC(Br)Br**:  
**-0.67449076**  

This matches the trend observed for other fully halogenated small molecules without additional functional groups.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.5578902920402156
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)`)** – Present in the molecule and also in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **0.51813545**). This group tends to contribute moderately positive values.
2. **Aromatic ring (`c1ccccc1`)** – Common in many examples, but its contribution depends on substituents. Here, it's part of a lactam-like structure (`N2C(=O)...C2=O`), similar to cyclic amides in other examples (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`, property = **2.47799909**).
3. **Chlorine substituent (`C(CCl)`)** – Halogens often appear with the baseline value (-0.67449076), but when combined with polar groups, the property increases.
4. **Thioether linkage (`SC(CCl)`)** – Similar to `CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1` (property = **-0.19578452**), but here it's part of a more complex structure.
5. **Lactam-like ring (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`)** – This resembles cyclic amides/ureas, which tend to increase the property (e.g., `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O`, property = **2.03261162**).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule combines features from `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.518) and cyclic amides (~2.0–2.5). The presence of both the phosphorothioate and the lactam suggests a property higher than 0.518 but likely less than 2.5 due to the lack of additional polar groups (e.g., multiple amides or hydroxyls).

### Predicted property:
Given the balance between the phosphorothioate (moderate positive contribution) and the lactam (stronger positive contribution), the predicted value is approximately **1.5–2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**1.83166956** (similar to the example `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)C(F)(F)F)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`, which has comparable complexity).

### Final answer:
**1.83166956**

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 4.126745240352161
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and halogenated hydrocarbons** (e.g., CCCC#C, ClCCCCl, C=C(C)C) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
2. **Aromatic rings with simple substituents** (e.g., Cc1ccc(O)cc1, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O) often have a value of **-0.19820115**.
3. **Nitro groups (NO2)** (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) increase the property value to **~0.74263619**.
4. **Complex heterocycles or multiple functional groups** (e.g., Nc1cccc2ccccc12, Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) can lead to higher values (e.g., **-0.00983745** or **2.75212488**).
5. **Highly polar or reactive groups** (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1, CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O) can lead to very high values (e.g., **0.48350152** or **12.01087159**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** has the following features:
1. **Amide group**: **C(=O)N** (similar to NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1, which has a value of **0.48350152**).
2. **Aromatic ring with a chloro substituent**: This alone might suggest a value around **-0.19820115** (like Cl-substituted aromatics).
3. **Heterocyclic group (n2nc(oc2=O))**: This is a complex, polar heterocycle, which could increase the property value significantly (similar to other heterocycles in the examples).
4. **Tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: This is bulky but not highly polar, so its effect may be minor.
5. **N,N-dimethyl substitution (CN(C))**: This is moderately polar but not as impactful as nitro or sulfonamide groups.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The presence of the amide and heterocycle is reminiscent of **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (0.48350152)** and **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23 (0.14423665)**.
- The nitro-like polarity of the heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O)) might push the value higher, similar to nitro-substituted aromatics (~0.74263619).
- The chloro substituent alone would not dominate, as seen in other examples where Cl does not drastically alter the value unless combined with other polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combination of the amide, heterocycle, and chloro substituent, the property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity to molecules with values like 0.48350152 and 1.74087645). 

For a more precise prediction, statistical modeling or additional examples would be needed, but this is a reasonable estimate given the data. 

---
**Final Answer: ~1.25** (likely between 1.0 and 1.5 based on the given examples).

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.1160610597794856
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Halides (e.g., CCCCCBr, BrC(Br)Br, ICI)**: These tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**, suggesting that halogens (Br, I, Cl) in simple aliphatic contexts contribute to this baseline value.
2. **Aromatic Chlorides (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2)**: These also often have the value **-0.67449076**, indicating that aromatic chlorides may follow the same trend as aliphatic halides unless other functional groups are present.
3. **Phenol Derivatives (e.g., Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)**: These tend to have a property value of **-0.19820115**, suggesting that hydroxyl groups (OH) on aromatic rings with chlorides increase the property value compared to purely halogenated aromatics.
4. **Dihydroxy or Polyphenol Derivatives (e.g., COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1)**: These have higher positive values (e.g., **5.1447661**), indicating that multiple hydroxyl groups significantly increase the property value.
5. **Complex or Mixed Functional Groups**: Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, amines) tend to have higher or more variable values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which consists of:
- Two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen (diphenyl ether structure).
- Each ring has:
  - One hydroxyl group (OH).
  - One or two chlorine atoms (Cl).

This is structurally similar to:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = **-0.19820115**), but with an additional aromatic ring and more chlorines.
- **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = **-0.19820115**), which has multiple chlorines but still retains the -0.19820115 value.

Given that the presence of hydroxyl groups seems to set the property to **-0.19820115** even with multiple chlorines, and the diphenyl ether linkage does not appear in other examples to drastically alter this trend, the most reasonable prediction is that the property value for this molecule is also **-0.19820115**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is **-0.19820115**.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the molecule `CC/C=C\C` (which is equivalent to `CC=CC` or 2-butene) is structurally similar to `CC/C=C/C` (also 2-butene, but with a different stereochemistry, i.e., trans vs. cis). 

In the examples, `CC/C=C/C` has a property value of `-0.67449076`. Since stereochemistry (cis/trans) does not appear to significantly affect the property in this context (as evidenced by other similar molecules like `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, and `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` all sharing the same value), we can infer that `CC/C=C\C` will have the same property value.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is:

**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.48743469322008653
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain key values, and the structure of the molecule seems to influence these values. Here are some patterns:

1. **Simple alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and halogenated aromatics** (e.g., `CC#C`, `CC(C)Cl`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`, `C1CCCCCC1`) often have the property value **-0.67449076**.
   - These are typically non-polar or minimally functionalized molecules.

2. **Molecules with hydroxyl (-OH) or ether (-O-) groups** (e.g., `CC(C)O`, `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1`, `CCC(O)CC`) often have the property value **-0.19820115**.
   - The presence of oxygen in these forms seems to elevate the property value slightly.

3. **Molecules with more complex polar or conjugated systems** (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23`, `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C`) have higher positive values, sometimes significantly so (e.g., 3.45223486, 0.23035109).

4. **Molecules with ester or carbonyl groups** (e.g., `CC(C)COC(=O)C`, `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`) often have a property value of **0.0** or slightly higher, depending on additional functionalization.

### Prediction for `CCCOCC`:
- This molecule is a simple ether (`C-O-C`), similar to `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) or `CCC(O)CC`, but with a slightly longer chain and no hydroxyl group.
- Ethers (like `COc1ccccc1O`) tend to have property values around **-0.19820115** or slightly higher (e.g., `COc1ccccc1O` has 0.11606106).
- Given the simplicity of `CCCOCC` (no aromaticity or additional polar groups), it is most similar to the aliphatic hydroxyl/ether examples with **-0.19820115**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for `CCCOCC` is **-0.19820115**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.23035109477591034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which contribute hydrophobicity but can also engage in π-π interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to the amide nitrogen adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 0.70442805): This has a tertiary amide, a phenyl ring, and a heterocyclic group. The property is moderately positive due to the polar amide and aromatic systems.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (property = 0.49689433): Contains an amide and aromatic rings, with a lower value due to fewer hydrophobic groups.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = -0.00983745): Aromatic systems with an amine, showing a near-neutral value.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property = 0.23035109): Tertiary amide with aliphatic rings, giving a slightly positive value.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **two phenyl rings and a bulky tert-butyl-like group** increases hydrophobicity but is offset by the polar amide.
   - The molecule lacks strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, hydroxyl, or carboxyl), so the property value won't be very high.
   - Compared to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (0.704), this molecule replaces a polar heterocycle with a hydrophobic tert-butyl group, likely reducing the property slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar amide and hydrophobic aromatic/tert-butyl groups, the property value should be **slightly lower than 0.70442805** but higher than purely hydrophobic molecules (e.g., -0.67449076). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.55** (rounded to two decimal places).  

### Justification:
- The amide contributes polarity (~0.5–1.5 range in examples).
- The two phenyl rings and tert-butyl group reduce the value compared to molecules with more polar substituents (e.g., nitro or heterocycles).
- The closest analog is **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (0.704), but this molecule is less polar, so a value of **0.55** fits well.  

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.55**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alcohols/Ethers** (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C`, `CO`, `CCC(C)O`): These tend to have property values around **-0.19820115**.
2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents** (e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`): These often have values around **-0.67449076**, especially if the substituents are non-polar (e.g., alkyl, halogen).
3. **Polar or Electron-Withdrawing Groups** (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`): These increase the property value (e.g., nitro groups or amides push the value to **~0.2–0.7**).
4. **Complex or Conjugated Systems** (e.g., `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2`): These can lead to higher values (e.g., **3.45** for cyclic amides).
5. **Brominated Aromatics** (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`): These typically have values of **-0.67449076** unless paired with polar groups.
6. **Amides on Aromatic Rings** (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`): These tend to have values around **0.23035109**.

### Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- The molecule is **N-acetyl-4-bromoaniline**, with:
  - A **brominated aromatic ring** (typically **-0.67449076** if standalone).
  - A **polar amide group (N-acetyl)** attached to the ring, which is electron-withdrawing and increases the property value.
- Similar examples:
  - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (amide + aromatic) has **0.23035109**.
  - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (aromatic + amine) has **-0.00983745**.
  - The bromine substituent slightly lowers the value compared to pure amide cases.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the **electron-withdrawing amide** (increasing the value) and the **bromine** (decreasing it), the property value should be **slightly positive but low**, similar to `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` but adjusted for the amide.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.11912312**  
*(This aligns with the trend of amide-substituted aromatics in the examples, adjusted for the bromine effect.)*

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple alkyl chains or alkanes** (e.g., CCCCCCC#C, C=Cc1ccccc1, C=CCCC=C) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
2. **Benzene rings with simple alkyl substitutions** (e.g., Cc1ccccc1N, Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32, CCc1ccc(C)cc1) often have values around **-0.67449076** or slightly higher if polar groups are present.
3. **Branched alkyl groups attached to benzene** (e.g., CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1) also have the value **-0.67449076**.
4. The presence of polar or functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -C=O, -N) tends to increase the property value significantly.

### Analysis of **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
- The molecule is **isopropylbenzene** (cumene), with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) attached to a benzene ring.
- This is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (a tert-butylbenzene analog), which has a value of **-0.67449076**.
- No polar or functional groups are present to increase the value.

### Conclusion:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **-0.67449076**, matching the trend for simple alkyl-substituted benzenes in the given data.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.28979861021885145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple aromatic aldehydes/ketones**: 
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide with a hydroxyl group) has a high value of **2.17807401**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (a more complex aromatic diketone) has a value of **1.74087645**.
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ketone) has a value of **0.75516341**.
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (a cyclic enone) has a value of **-0.28979861**.

2. **Simple aromatic systems without polar groups**:
   - **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12** (a naphthalene derivative) has a value of **-0.67449076**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) also has **-0.67449076**.

3. **Aldehyde/ketone contribution**:
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) seems to increase the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon systems, but the exact value depends on conjugation and additional functional groups.

### Analysis of **O=Cc1ccccc1**:
- This is a simple aromatic aldehyde (phenylacetaldehyde) with a conjugated carbonyl group. 
- It lacks additional polar groups (like -OH or -NO₂) that would significantly increase the property value (as seen in **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** or **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**).
- Compared to purely aromatic hydrocarbons (which consistently give **-0.67449076**), the aldehyde group should raise the value, but not as much as highly polar or nitro-substituted systems.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (0.75516341) is a complex ketone, but **O=Cc1ccccc1** is simpler and less polar.
- **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (-0.28979861) is a non-aromatic enone, and the aromatic conjugation in **O=Cc1ccccc1** might give a slightly higher value.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 13.085107541591107
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural observations:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the aromatic ring (similar to the first example: `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, which has a high value of **1.308**). Nitro groups often correlate with higher property values.
2. **Heterocyclic core with two amide (N-C=O) groups**: The central structure is a 5-membered ring with two amide-like functionalities (similar to hydantoin or imidazolidinedione). Molecules with such polar, hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` = **0.659**) tend to have mid-range positive values.
3. **Aromatic system with an oxygen linker**: The nitro-substituted aromatic ring is connected via a nitrogen linker, adding polarity (similar to the first example and `CN(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` = **0.659**).

### Comparison to examples:
- The nitro group and amide functionalities suggest a value **> 0.5**, likely in the range of **0.6–1.3**.
- The closest analogs are:
  - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (**1.308**): Nitro + aromatic + polar linker.
  - `CN(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (**0.659**): Amide + aromatic linker.
  - `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (**0.659**): Heterocyclic with hydrogen-bonding.

### Predicted value:
Given the combined effects of the nitro group, polar heterocycle, and aromatic system, the property value is likely **~1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.05**  

*(This is based on interpolation between similar structures in the dataset, accounting for the nitro group's contribution and the polar core.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.0767566350671587
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.00983745**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **-0.05459722**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to these, with a hydrazine-like linker (N-N) between two phenyl rings instead of an azo group (N=N).

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Linkage**:
   - The presence of **N-N** (hydrazine-like) linkage is less conjugated than **N=N** (azo), so we might expect a slightly lower (more negative) value than **-0.05459722** but higher than simple aniline (**-0.00983745**).

3. **Bulkiness and Symmetry**:
   - The molecule is symmetric and bulky, similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but the N-N single bond reduces conjugation compared to N=N. This suggests a value closer to **-0.05459722** but slightly adjusted for reduced conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but with reduced conjugation due to the N-N single bond, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:

**-0.06** (approximate interpolation between **-0.00983745** and **-0.05459722**). 

However, looking at the trend, the N-N linkage might not significantly alter the value from the azo compound, so a refined estimate is:

**-0.05** (very close to the azo analog but slightly less negative due to reduced conjugation). 

Given the examples, the most reasonable prediction is:

**-0.05459722** (same as the azo analog, as the N-N vs N=N difference may not drastically affect the property in this context). 

But to be precise, since the N-N linkage is less conjugated, the value should be slightly more negative. Thus, a final prediction is:

**-0.06**. 

However, the closest match in the examples is **-0.05459722**, so we'll stick with that for consistency.

### Final Answer:
**-0.05459722**

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 3.452234859752658
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) in a cyclic structure (a diketopiperazine-like core). 
   - It also has a cyclohexane ring (**CCCC1**) fused to the diketopiperazine.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the property value (as seen in other amide-containing molecules in the examples).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 3.45223486): This molecule has a similar cyclic diamide structure with additional alkyl groups. The property is relatively high due to the amides and moderate flexibility.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 2.01083439): Another cyclic diamide with alkyl substituents, showing a high but slightly lower value than the previous example.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.10235926): A simple cyclic amide (lactam) with no additional polar groups, resulting in a much lower value.

4. **Steric and Electronic Effects**:
   - The cyclohexane ring in **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** adds rigidity but no additional polar groups, so the property value should be between the simpler lactam and the more substituted diamides.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of two amide groups in a rigid cyclic structure (but no nitro or other strongly polar substituents), the property value is likely **moderate-high**, similar to other cyclic diamides but slightly lower due to the lack of additional polar groups. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**~2.5** (interpolating between the examples with values of 2.01 and 3.45). 

However, looking more closely, the molecule is structurally closest to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (3.45), but with fewer alkyl groups and a more rigid cyclohexane ring. This would slightly reduce the value. 

Thus, the predicted property is:  
**≈ 2.8** (specific value: **2.8**). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is, for example, logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly. Based on the examples, higher values correlate with more polar/amide/nitro groups, so this prediction aligns with that trend.) 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.8**

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br, I) aromatic systems** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**:
   - Examples: 
     - `Clc1ccccc1Cl` → -0.67449076
     - `Ic1ccccc1` → -0.67449076
     - `ClCC(C)C` → -0.67449076
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → -0.67449076
     - `ClC(Br)Br` → -0.67449076
     - `CCCCCl` → -0.67449076

2. The molecule in question is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** with 3 chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. This fits the pattern of halogenated aromatic systems.

3. Other halogenated or non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`) also default to **-0.67449076**, suggesting this is a baseline for inert/non-functionalized structures.

### Conclusion:
The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a polychlorinated aromatic compound, similar to the examples above. Thus, its predicted property value is:

**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene) is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with alkyl substituents (ethyl groups). 

Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a property value of **-0.67449076**.
- **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) has a property value of **-0.00983745**.
- **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has a property value of **-0.40010115**.

The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is structurally most similar to hexylbenzene but with shorter alkyl chains (ethyl instead of hexyl). Since longer alkyl chains tend to decrease the property value (as seen with hexylbenzene having a lower value than toluidine), but aromaticity and substitution patterns also play a role, I estimate the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** to be slightly higher than hexylbenzene but still negative.

**Predicted property value: -0.40010115** (similar to ethylpyridine, as it has comparable alkyl substitution on an aromatic ring). 

This aligns with the trend where simple alkyl-substituted aromatics without polar functional groups have negative property values in this dataset.

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 5.010728776184729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO₂)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(C)C)N(=O)=O → 5.58181493 (two nitro groups)
     - Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O → 5.02712633 (two nitro groups)
     - Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O → 2.75212488 (one nitro group)
   - The presence of nitro groups seems to significantly increase the property value.

2. **Sulfonamide Group (S(N)(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule in question has a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O), which is somewhat analogous to a nitro group in terms of electron-withdrawing properties and polarity.
   - No exact examples with sulfonamide are given, but we can infer that it may behave similarly to nitro groups but with a slightly less pronounced effect.

3. **Amino Group (NH₂)**:
   - The molecule also has an amino group (NH₂), which is present in some of the examples:
     - Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 → 4.14228757
     - Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O → 2.75212488
   - The amino group alone does not seem to increase the property value as much as nitro groups, but it contributes to polarity.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with simple substituents (e.g., Cc1ccccc1) tend to have low or negative property values (-0.67449076).
   - When combined with polar groups (e.g., NO₂, NH₂), the property value increases.

### Prediction for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O:
- The molecule has:
  - One aromatic ring.
  - One amino group (NH₂).
  - One sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O), which is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to a nitro group but likely less extreme.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (one NH₂ and one NO₂) → 2.75212488.
  - The sulfonamide group is less polar than NO₂, so the property value should be slightly lower than 2.75212488 but still significantly higher than simple aromatic systems.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable prediction for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is:

**2.5** (approximate, likely between 2.0 and 3.0 based on the examples). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the sulfonamide group might be closer in effect to the nitro group than initially assumed. For instance, the molecule with one NO₂ and one NH₂ (Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) has a value of 2.75212488. Since the sulfonamide is similarly polar, the value might be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

Thus, a more precise estimate would be:

**2.6** (rounded from the likely range of 2.5-2.7). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, let's choose:

**2.75212488** (same as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, since the sulfonamide is roughly equivalent in polarity to the nitro group in this context). 

However, since the sulfonamide is slightly less polar, a slight reduction is warranted. 

Final prediction: **2.5** (approximate). 

But given the examples, the closest match is likely **2.75212488** (same as the nitro analog). 

Thus, the predicted property value is:

**2.75212488** (same as the structurally similar Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O). 

### Final Answer:
**2.75212488**

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to predict the property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic/Conjugated Systems with Halogens or Heavy Atoms**:
   - Molecules like **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** and **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** have property values of **-0.67449076**.
   - These are highly halogenated aromatic systems, and the property seems to correlate with their structural symmetry and halogen content.

2. **Simple Aromatic Rings (No Halogens or Functional Groups)**:
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane) and **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) also have the value **-0.67449076**, suggesting that purely aliphatic or simple aromatic systems without functional groups default to this value.
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) also has **-0.67449076**.

3. **Functional Groups and Heteroatoms**:
   - Molecules with functional groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-C=O**, **-N=O**, **-S=O**) deviate from **-0.67449076**. For example:
     - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene) has **-0.48743469**.
     - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (ethylphenol) has **-0.19820115**.
     - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has **-0.00983745**.
   - The presence of polar or electronegative groups increases the property value.

4. **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**:
   - Many PAHs like **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** and **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** have the value **-0.67449076**, indicating that pure PAHs without functional groups default to this baseline.

### Target Molecule: **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**
- This is a **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)** with four fused benzene rings (a phenanthrene-like structure).
- It has **no functional groups, halogens, or heteroatoms**, just carbon and hydrogen.
- Comparing to the examples:
  - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (a similar PAH) has **-0.67449076**.
  - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (another PAH) has **-0.67449076**.

### Conclusion:
Since the target molecule is a pure PAH with no functional groups or heteroatoms, it will default to the same property value as other similar PAHs in the examples.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 9.578399908709498
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property value based on structural features and trends observed in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple halogenated alkanes** (e.g., ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl, ClCCl, ClC(Br)Br, CC(C)I) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
2. **Molecules with aromatic rings and no polar/hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., Fc1ccccc1, c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45) also tend to have the value **-0.67449076**.
3. **Molecules with hydroxyl (-OH) groups** often have higher property values, especially if multiple -OH groups are present (e.g., OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a very high value of **10.50302995**).
4. **Molecules with carbonyl (C=O) groups and hydrogen-bonding capabilities** tend to have intermediate to high values (e.g., O=C1CNC(=O)N1 has **1.74087645**).
5. **Molecules with complex fused rings and polar groups** (e.g., OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl) have values around **0.9-1.0**.

### Target Molecule:
**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This molecule has:
- Multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups (4 in total: two on the left benzene ring and two on the right benzene ring).
- A carbonyl (C=O) group in a fused ring system.
- A complex, polar, and hydrogen-bonding-rich structure.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (two -OH groups) has a value of **0.60198581**.
2. **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (complex polar structure) has **0.90437279**.
3. **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (multiple -OH groups) has **10.50302995**.

Given that the target molecule has 4 -OH groups and a carbonyl group, but is not as saturated with -OH as OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, its value should be higher than most examples but not as extreme as the latter. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the above reasoning, I predict the property value for the target molecule to be around **2.5 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted value: 2.50576571**  
(This matches the value of a similarly complex molecule with multiple -OH groups and a carbonyl, like "Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4" which has **2.50576571**). 

Thus, the predicted property value is:

True Property: 1.5249822664178727
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, Cc1cccc(C)c1)**: These tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**, suggesting that aliphatic chains or simple aromatic rings without polar groups result in this baseline value.

2. **Polar or Functionalized Aliphatics (e.g., CCC(O)CC, CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Introducing polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -N=O, -C=O) increases the property value. For example:
   - **CCC(O)CC**: -0.19820115 (alcohol)
   - **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 1.30473643 (ester + amine)

3. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**:
   - Phosphorothioates (P=S) and phosphates (P=O) with aromatic/chlorinated groups tend to have **moderate positive values (0.04989549 to 0.83246454)**.
   - The presence of **Cl** or **S** seems to contribute to higher values.

4. **Highly Polar or Conjugated Systems (e.g., NC(N)=NC#N, Nc1nccs1, Nc1nc[nH]n1)**:
   - These have **high property values (2.58925523 to 5.34852891)**, likely due to strong hydrogen bonding or conjugation.

5. **Sterically Hindered or Complex Structures (e.g., CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO)**: These can have very high values (e.g., **6.5967167**) due to multiple functional groups and rigidity.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- **Structural Features**:
  - Phosphate group: **P(=O)**
  - Amide linkage: **NC(C)=O**
  - Thiolate (S-) group: **SC**
  - Methyl group: **C**
  - Ethoxy-like fragment: **COP**

- **Analogous Examples**:
  - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 0.04989549 (P=S, Cl, aromatic)
  - **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 0.83246454 (P=O, Cl, aromatic)
  - **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: 0.51813545 (P=S, S, aliphatic)

- **Prediction**:
  - The presence of **P=O** (higher polarity than P=S) and **S** (thiolate) suggests a value higher than 0.51813545 but lower than 0.83246454 (due to lack of aromatic/Cl groups).
  - The amide (**NC(C)=O**) adds polarity, further increasing the value slightly.
  - The absence of aromatic/Cl groups may limit the increase.

### Final Prediction:
Given the balance of P=O, S, and amide, the predicted property value is approximately **0.65**.

However, looking more closely at the examples, the closest analog is **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.83246454)**, but without the aromatic/Cl groups, the value would be lower. Another close analog is **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (0.51813545)**, but with P=O instead of P=S, the value would be higher. 

Thus, a refined estimate is **~0.6**.

### Final Answer:
**0.6** (approximate, based on structural analogies and trends).
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes/cycloalkanes (e.g., CC1CCCC1, CCCC(C)C) tend to have values around -0.674
2. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings without polar groups often have -0.674
3. Molecules with polar groups (OH, CO, etc.) show higher values
4. Molecules with multiple polar groups or hydrogen bonding capabilities (especially N-H groups) show the highest values (3-4 range)
5. The presence of halogens (Cl, F) alone doesn't necessarily increase the value unless combined with other polar features

For the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl (1,2-dichloroethene):
- It's a simple alkene with two chlorines
- No hydrogen bonding capability
- No other polar groups
- Similar to other simple halogenated compounds in the dataset (e.g., CCBr, CCCCBr) which show -0.674

The most similar compounds in the dataset are simple halogenated aliphatics, all showing -0.674.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is: -0.67449076

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.40010114678593245
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): Property = -0.42136495
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: Property = 2.91507987 (complex, but has nitro and amide groups)
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): Property = 2.18263289 (high due to nitro group)
   - **COc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroanisole): Property = 1.3081747 (lower than nitrophenol due to methoxy)
   - **CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O**: Property = 3.51954983 (very high due to multiple nitro and amide groups)

2. **Simple Heterocycles**:
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (purine derivative): Property = 1.95486273 (high due to multiple nitrogens and conjugated system)
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (purine derivative): Property = 1.25301391 (high due to multiple nitrogens)
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: Property = -0.0182135 (moderate, fused heterocycle with nitrogens)

3. **Simple Pyridine-like Structures**:
   - **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. No direct examples are given, but:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (aniline derivative) has property = -0.42136495.
     - Pyridine is more polarizable than benzene but lacks the strong electron-donating/depleting groups seen in high-value examples.

4. **Trends**:
   - The presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) or amides (C(=O)N) tends to increase the property value significantly.
   - Simple heterocycles with nitrogen (like pyridine) tend to have moderate values unless they have additional functional groups.
   - The property for pyridine is likely between -0.5 and 0.5 based on the examples.

### Prediction for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine):
Given that:
- Pyridine is a simple heterocycle with one nitrogen (similar to benzene but slightly more polarizable).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present.
- The closest analogs (simple aromatic rings with heteroatoms) have values around -0.4 to 0.0.

**Predicted property value for pyridine: -0.28979861** (similar to other simple heterocycles or slightly higher than benzene-like structures). 

However, looking at **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (property = -0.0182135), which is a fused nitrogen-containing heterocycle, pyridine (simpler) might be slightly lower. 

Given the uncertainty, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.19820115** (similar to other simple oxygen/nitrogen-containing aromatics like **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1** or **CC(C)(C)CCO**). 

But since pyridine is more akin to benzene with a nitrogen, and **CNc1ccccc1** is -0.42136495, pyridine might be slightly higher (less negative) due to the nitrogen's electronegativity. 

Final prediction: **-0.28979861** (similar to **CCCC=O** or other simple polar molecules in the dataset). 

However, after reconsidering, the closest simple aromatic with a heteroatom is **CNc1ccccc1** (-0.42136495), and pyridine is somewhat similar but with less electron donation. Thus, a value closer to **-0.28979861** seems reasonable. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is **-0.28979861**.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 5.978057369484255
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`): Similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = 14.374) and `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 5.695), which have high values due to high polarity/H-bonding.
   - Ester (`COC(=O)-`): Present in molecules like `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = 1.324) and `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (property = 1.305), contributing moderately.
   - Aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3...`): Similar to `Nc1ccccc1` in `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (property = 0.636), adding some polarity.
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc23`): Similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property = -0.674), but here it's part of a larger conjugated system, likely less negative impact.

2. **Conjugated System**:
   - The molecule has extended conjugation (`c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3...`), but aromaticity alone (e.g., `c1ccc2cnccc2c1`, property = -0.400) doesn't dominate over polar groups.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog is **`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccccc2`** (not in examples, but similar to `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` with property = 0.636). Here, the additional hydroxyls and ester will increase the value.
   - Polyols dominate the property (e.g., 14.374 for 6 hydroxyls). This molecule has 2 hydroxyls, so expect a significant but smaller contribution.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The ester + aromatic amine + hydroxyls suggest a value **higher than 1.324** (from `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC`) but **much lower than 5.695** (from a polyol with 4 hydroxyls).
- The chloro-aromatic may slightly reduce the value, but the hydroxyls outweigh it.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar groups and the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**~3.5** (likely between 3.0 and 4.0, closer to the higher end due to multiple hydroxyls).  

For specificity, we'll predict:  
**3.752** (interpolated based on similar examples).

**Final Answer:**  
**3.752** (estimated based on structural contributions).

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. 

For the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), which is a simple aliphatic alcohol with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a linear carbon chain, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a property value of **-0.19820115**.
2. **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (a bulky non-polar molecule) has a value of **-0.67449076**.
3. **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.19820115**.
4. **CCCc1ccccc1** (a simple non-polar molecule) has a value of **-0.67449076**.

The hydroxyl group in **CCCCCO** introduces some polarity, similar to the alcohols in the dataset, but it lacks aromaticity or additional functional groups that would significantly increase the property value (as seen in more complex or polar molecules like amides, nitro groups, or conjugated systems). 

Given this, the property value for **CCCCCO** is likely close to the other simple alcohols in the dataset, such as **OC1CCCCCCC1** or **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, which both have a value of **-0.19820115**. 

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCO**: **-0.19820115**

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 3.1177584868281936
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with moderate property values (e.g., -0.400 for Sc2nc1ccccc1s2, 1.285 for Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2).
2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 (property = 0.102) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (property = 3.452). This group tends to increase the property value.
3. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Not directly present in the examples, but sulfonyl-containing groups (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) have higher property values (2.932). This suggests a significant positive contribution.
4. **Heterocyclic ring (CCO1)**: The presence of an oxygen in the ring (like in OCC1OC...) is associated with higher property values (e.g., 5.695 for C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of an aromatic amide and a sulfonyl-containing heterocycle. 
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** (two aromatic rings with amino groups) has a property of 1.285.
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (sulfonyl + aromatic + nitro) has a property of 2.932.
- The given molecule lacks strongly polarizing groups like nitro or multiple hydroxyls but has an amide + sulfonyl combination, which is likely to give a moderately high value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities and the contributions of the amide and sulfonyl groups, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.85**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, accounting for the balance between the aromatic amide and sulfonyl contributions.)*

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 9.733994094727317
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring with nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)**: This is a strong electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.74263619**, and `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a very high value of **5.58181493**).
2. **Ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`)**: These are polar and can contribute to higher property values, especially when combined with other functional groups.
3. **Substituted aromatic system**: The molecule has a complex fused ring system with multiple substituents, which can increase the property value due to increased polarity and conjugation.
4. **No strongly hydrophobic/aliphatic dominance**: Unlike molecules like `CCCCCC` or `CCC(C)(C)CC` (which have values of **-0.67449076**), this molecule has significant polar and electron-withdrawing features.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The presence of **two nitro groups** (or one nitro and other polar groups) in the examples leads to high positive values (e.g., **0.74263619**, **5.58181493**).
- The molecule also resembles some of the more complex polar structures with fused rings and multiple functional groups (e.g., `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` has a value of **1.53690588**).

### Prediction:
Given the nitro group, ester groups, and conjugated aromatic system, the property value is likely in the **moderate to high positive range**. A reasonable estimate would be close to **1.5**, similar to other nitro-containing or highly polar conjugated systems in the examples.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**1.53690588**  
*(This matches the value of a similarly complex nitro-containing molecule in the examples.)*

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 3.452234859752658
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It forms a bicyclic structure where the amides are part of a 5-membered ring (imidazolidine-2,4-dione or hydantoin-like core).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors). 
   - The cyclopropane ring adds rigidity but does not contribute significantly to polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple amide/carbonyl groups (e.g., **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, property = 2.17079197) tend to have higher property values due to strong polarity and hydrogen bonding.
   - Smaller rigid bicyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, property = 0.75516341) also have elevated values.
   - The presence of two amides in a small ring system here suggests a significant contribution to the property.

4. **Lack of Aromaticity or Extended Conjugation**: 
   - Unlike some examples with large aromatic systems (e.g., polyaromatics with property = -0.67449076), this molecule lacks extended conjugation, so the value won't be as low as those.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity of the amides in a constrained ring system, the property value is likely **moderately high**, similar to other polar, bicyclic small molecules in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.8**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity to examples like **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (2.17) but slightly lower due to the smaller size and lack of additional substituents.)

Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value for simple halogenated alkanes tends to be -0.67449076 (seen in C1CC=CC1, Clc1ccccc1, CCC1CCCCC1, etc.). 

The molecule ClCC (chloroethane) is a simple halogenated alkane with no additional functional groups or complex structures that would modify this baseline value. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is: -0.67449076

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.40010114678593245
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly negative values (-0.67449076)** are associated with:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`).
   - Halogenated alkanes/aromatics with no other functional groups (e.g., `ClCC(Cl)Cl`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`, `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2`).
   - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23`, `c1ccc2c3c(ccc2c1)c4cccc5cccc3c45`).

2. **Moderate negative values (-0.19820115 to -0.48743469)** are associated with:
   - Molecules with oxygen or nitrogen in simple contexts (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`, `CCCCCC(C)O`, `CCCOC(C)C`).

3. **Positive values (0.0 to ~5.0)** are associated with:
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or other polar/electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl`).
   - Amides, esters, or other functional groups with conjugation (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1`).

4. **Very high values (>5.0)** are associated with:
   - Multiple nitro groups or highly polar/ionic structures (e.g., `CCC(C)c1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O`, `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)S(N)(=O)=O)N(=O)=O`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**:
- It is a **chlorinated pyridine derivative** (heterocyclic nitrogen in the ring) with additional **CCl3** group.
- No nitro or other strongly polar groups are present.
- The presence of multiple chlorines and a nitrogen heterocycle suggests moderate polarity, but not extreme.

### Similar Examples:
- `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` (with nitro group) has a value of **0.74263619**.
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (no nitro group) has a value of **-0.67449076**.
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (no nitro group) has a value of **-0.67449076**.

Since the target molecule lacks a nitro group but has a nitrogen heterocycle and multiple chlorines, its value is likely **between -0.67449076 and 0.74263619**. Given the absence of strong electron-withdrawing groups, it is closer to the lower end.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is **-0.19820115**. This aligns with molecules like `Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` or `Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl`, which have moderate polarity due to halogens or heteroatoms but no strongly polarizing groups.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O

Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic chain tends to be **-0.19820115**. This is observed in the following similar structures from the examples:

- **CCCC(O)CCC**: -0.19820115  
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: -0.19820115  
- **CCC(C)CCO**: -0.19820115  
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: -0.19820115 (though aromatic, the -OH group is present)  
- **CCC(CC)CO**: -0.19820115  

The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic chain (hexanol derivative), which matches the structural pattern of the examples above. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.19820115**

To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Cl-substituted benzenes) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**:
   - Examples:
     - `ClCCl` (dichloromethane): -0.67449076
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (dichlorobiphenyl): -0.67449076
     - `ClC(Cl)Cl` (chloroform): -0.67449076
     - `ClC(=C)Cl` (dichloroethene): -0.67449076
     - `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl` (carbon tetrachloride): -0.67449076
     - `CI` (chloroiodomethane): -0.67449076

2. **Brominated analogs** (e.g., Br-substituted benzenes) are chemically similar to chlorinated analogs, and the property value is likely the same unless other functional groups are present.

3. The molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is a simple dibromobenzene with no additional functional groups, so it fits the pattern of the halogenated aromatic compounds above.

### Prediction:
The property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-0.67449076**, consistent with the trend observed for simple halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatic compounds in the examples.

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property value of -0.67449076 is associated with highly chlorinated aromatic compounds and fully saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., C=CCC=C, CCCC(C)O, CCCC=C(CC)C=O, etc.). 

The molecule in question is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions. This closely resembles other highly chlorinated aromatic molecules in the dataset (e.g., **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** and **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45**), all of which have the property value **-0.67449076**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:

**-0.67449076**

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 0.8324645378129518
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)O...)**: This is a polar and ionizable group, which can significantly influence the property.
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: The aromatic rings are substituted with methyl groups, which are hydrophobic.
4. **Ether linkages (Oc)**: The phosphate group is connected to the aromatic rings via ether linkages, adding some polarity.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **polar/ionizable groups (e.g., phosphate, carboxyl, nitro, or amide)** tend to have higher property values (e.g., 1.55789029 for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`, 4.12674524 for `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C`).
- Molecules with **aromatic rings and hydrophobic substituents (e.g., methyl, chloro)** but no strongly polar groups tend to have lower values (e.g., -0.67449076 for `Clc1ccccc1Cl`, -0.67449076 for `CC(C)c1ccccc1`).
- The presence of **phosphate (P=O)** is particularly notable, as it is highly polar and often associated with higher values (e.g., 1.55789029 for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`).

### Prediction:
Given the **phosphate group** and **multiple aromatic rings**, this molecule is likely to have a **moderate to high property value**, similar to other phosphate-containing examples. The methyl groups and aromaticity will slightly offset this, but the phosphate dominates.

Looking at similar examples:
- `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a value of **1.55789029**.
- `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` has a value of **-0.2504202** (less polar than ours).

Our molecule is more polar than the second example but less complex than the first. A reasonable estimate would be between **0.5 and 2.0**. 

Given the **two aromatic rings attached to the phosphate**, I predict a value closer to **1.2**.

### Final Prediction:
**1.2** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.1957845181432913
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular weight, and structural complexity. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O`

### Key Features:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (`CF3`):** This is a highly electronegative and polar group, which often increases the property value (e.g., see `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with a high value of 13.2005265 due to sulfonamide and nitro groups).
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents:** The `c1cccc(c1)` ring is substituted with `CF3` and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which adds polarity.
3. **Heterocycle with carbonyl and chloro substituents:** The `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` moiety includes a carbonyl group (`C=O`) and two chlorine atoms, both of which are polar and likely to increase the property value.
4. **Comparison to similar molecules:**
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitroaniline) has a value of 2.75212488.
   - `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (nitrochlorobenzene) has a value of 0.74263619.
   - The presence of `CF3` and the more complex heterocycle here suggests a higher value than these examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combination of `CF3`, aromaticity, polar heterocycle, and chloro substituents, the property value is likely in the range of **3.0 to 5.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 3.852**  

This is based on the molecule's similarity to other polar/nitro-containing compounds in the dataset but with additional contributions from the `CF3` and heterocyclic carbonyl group.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.3081747041634069
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, often associated with property values around 0 to -0.674 (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has -0.198, `Cc1cccc(C)c1` has -0.674).
2. **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Seen in `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 1.324) and `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC` (property = 9.733). This group tends to increase the property value slightly.
3. **Nitro group (-NO2, represented as N(=O)=O)**: Seen in:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 5.027),
   - `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC` (property = 9.733),
   - `CCCC1C(=O)N3N(C1=O)c2cc(C)ccc2N=C3N(C)C` (property = 1.586).
   The nitro group significantly increases the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic ring.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has a property of **5.027**.
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (dimethyl phthalate) has a property of **1.324**.
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a property of **-0.198**.

The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) has:
- One nitro group (strongly increasing the property, similar to dinitrobenzene but only one nitro group).
- One methoxy group (moderately increasing the property, similar to dimethyl phthalate but less impactful than nitro).

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong influence of the nitro group and the moderate influence of the methoxy group, the property value should be between **1.324** (dimethyl phthalate) and **5.027** (dinitrobenzene). A reasonable estimate is around **3.0 to 4.0**. 

Looking at the examples, a plausible value is **3.5**, but since the exact value isn't directly matched, we can interpolate based on similar structures. A closer match is **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (5.027) with two nitro groups, so one nitro group might halve this effect (~2.5). Adding the methoxy group could push it slightly higher.

However, another similar molecule is `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (property = 0.262) and `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (property = 0.659), where aromatic systems with polar groups have values in the 0.2-0.6 range. The nitro group is more impactful, so we adjust upward.

Given the data, the most reasonable prediction is **5.02712633** (same as dinitrobenzene, since the methoxy and nitro effects might balance out similarly). But since the methoxy is less impactful than a second nitro, a slightly lower value is plausible.

However, the closest direct analogy is `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (5.027), and with one nitro, we might expect ~2.5. But `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` is 1.324, and nitro is stronger than ester, so perhaps ~3.0.

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer based on the examples is:  
**Predicted property value: 5.02712633** (same as dinitrobenzene, assuming the methoxy and nitro effects are comparable to two nitro groups in this context). 

But if we consider the methoxy is less impactful, a value of **3.5** might be more accurate. Since the examples don't have a perfect match, I'll default to the closest nitro-aromatic example:  
**Final answer: 5.02712633**. 

(Note: Without a clear trend or model, this is an approximate interpolation. The true value might differ slightly.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule is saturated with chlorine atoms (Cl), similar to some examples like:
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (property = -0.67449076)
   - `ClCCCl` (property = -0.67449076)
   - `Clc1ccccc1` (property = -0.67449076)

   These heavily chlorinated or halogenated structures consistently show a property value of **-0.67449076**.

2. **No Functional Groups or Polar Features**: The molecule lacks polar or functional groups (e.g., NO2, COOH, OH, etc.) that would increase the property value (as seen in high-value examples like nitro compounds or carboxylic acids). It is purely a chlorinated hydrocarbon.

3. **Aliphatic vs. Aromatic**: The molecule is aliphatic (no aromatic rings), similar to other aliphatic chlorinated compounds in the examples, which all have the same property value.

4. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - `BrC(Br)Br` (property = -0.67449076)
   - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property = -0.67449076)
   - `ClCC#N` (property = -0.0857143, but this has a nitrile group, which is polar and increases the value).

   The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) alone, without other functional groups, correlates with the value **-0.67449076**.

### Conclusion:
The molecule is a heavily chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon with no other functional groups. All such examples in the given data have a property value of **-0.67449076**.

### Predicted Property Value:

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Cycloalkanes** (e.g., C1CCCCCC1, CCC#C, CCCCCCCCC=C, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These are non-polar, saturated hydrocarbons with no functional groups.
2. **Molecules with Halogens** (e.g., Cl, Br, I) but no other functional groups (e.g., Clc1ccccc1I, Clc1ccccc1Cl) also tend to have the value **-0.67449076** unless paired with polar or reactive groups.
3. **Polar or Functionalized Molecules**:
   - **Alcohols (OH)**: Tend to increase the property value (e.g., CC(O)c1ccccc1: -0.19820115; OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO: 14.37427344).
   - **Esters (COOR)**: Tend to have moderate positive values (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1: 1.30473643; CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2: 1.63022089).
   - **Nitro (NO2) and Amide (CONH)**: Significantly increase the property value (e.g., O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O: 5.02712633; NC(=O)N: 2.74683621).
   - **Formate (HCOOR)**: Similar to esters but simpler. No direct example, but esters generally have positive values.

### Analysis of CCCOC=O:
- The molecule is **propyl formate (HCOOCH2CH2CH3)**, an ester.
- It has a **formyl (C=O) attached to an oxygen (O)**, making it a formate ester.
- Esters in the examples have property values in the range of **0.5 to 2.0** (e.g., 1.30473643 for CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1).
- Since this is a simpler ester (no aromatic rings or additional functional groups), the value is likely on the lower end of this range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**0.8** (approximate, likely between 0.7 and 1.3 based on ester examples).  

However, looking more closely at similar small esters:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1: 1.30473643 (includes an aromatic ring and amine, which increase the value).
- CCCOC=O lacks these additional features, so a slightly lower value is expected.  

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**0.9** (specific value based on interpolation of ester examples).  

### Final Answer:
**0.9** (estimated property value for CCCOC=O).
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CC, CCCI, CCCCCCCc1ccccc1)**: These typically have a property value of **-0.67449076**, suggesting that saturated or purely hydrocarbon structures (without polar or functional groups) default to this value.
2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (e.g., COCC(=O)N...)**: The presence of ester groups (e.g., **C(=O)O**) tends to increase the property value (e.g., 1.55789029 for the first example).
   - **Alcohols (e.g., Oc1ccc(O)cc1)**: Hydroxyl groups (**OH**) can increase the property value (e.g., 0.60198581 for a diol).
   - **Carboxylic Acids or Derivatives**: These often lead to higher values (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C** has 3.45223486).
3. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., **CCCC=C(CC)C=O**) have values like **-0.28979861**, suggesting that the presence of a carbonyl (**C=O**) slightly increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - The molecule **CCCCC(CC)C=O** has a value of **-0.28979861**, similar to other aldehydes or ketones with moderate chain lengths.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**
- This is a **long-chain aliphatic ester**:
  - **CCCCCCCCC**: A long hydrocarbon chain (similar to pure hydrocarbons, which default to -0.67449076).
  - **C(=O)OCC**: An ester group (ethyl ester), which is polar and likely increases the property value.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **COCC(=O)N...** (first example) has a value of **1.55789029**, but it also includes an amide and aromatic ring, which likely contribute to the higher value.
  - Simpler esters like **CCOc1ccccc1** (ethyl phenyl ether) have a value of **-0.48743469**, but this is an ether, not an ester.
  - The closest analog is **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (an aldehyde) with **-0.28979861**, but esters are typically more polar than aldehydes.

Given that the ester group is more polar than a simple aldehyde or ether but less polar than amides or carboxylic acids, and considering the long hydrocarbon chain dampens the effect, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than **-0.28979861** but not as high as **1.55789029**.

### Predicted Property Value:
A plausible prediction for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is **-0.07675664** (similar to **CCNC(=S)NCC**, which has a polar thiourea group but is not as polar as a pure ester). However, since esters are more polar than thioureas in this context, a slightly higher value may be appropriate.

After reconsidering, a better estimate is **-0.19820115** (similar to **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**), as the ester group's polarity is partially offset by the long hydrocarbon chain.

### Final Answer:
**-0.19820115**

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 6.128549808555364
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.48743469), but with additional substitutions.
   - Phenol derivatives in the examples tend to have negative or low-positive values unless other strong functional groups are present.

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Amides like **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** have a property = 0.73992264.
   - This suggests the amide group increases the property value.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Nitro groups strongly increase the property, e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a property = 0.74263619.
   - The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing moiety, likely contributing significantly to the property.

4. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**: 
   - Chlorine substitutions alone (e.g., **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) tend to give negative or neutral values, but combined with nitro/amide, they may not dominate.

5. **Overall complexity**: 
   - The molecule combines phenol, amide, nitro, and chloro groups, resembling some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** = 0.74263619 and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** = 0.73992264).
   - The presence of two chloro groups and a nitro group likely pushes the value higher than simple amides or nitrobenzenes.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: 0.74263619 (nitro + chloro)
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1**: 0.73992264 (amide)
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.48743469 (phenol + chloro)
- **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**: 0.11606106 (multiple chloro + phenol)

Given the additive effects of the nitro and amide groups, and considering the phenol/chloro baseline, the property value should be higher than **0.74263619** (nitro + chloro) but not as extreme as cases with multiple nitro/amide groups (e.g., **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** = 5.01072878).

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~1.5 to 2.5**, interpolating between the nitro/amide examples and accounting for the additional chloro substitutions. 

Looking at the examples, **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2** (two amides) has a value of 3.45223486, while **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (one nitro) is 0.74263619. This molecule has one nitro and one amide, so the value should be between these, likely closer to the higher end due to the combined effects.

**Final Prediction: 2.0** (approximate, likely between 1.8 and 2.2 based on the trend). 

However, the presence of two chloro groups might slightly reduce the effect, so a more precise estimate is **1.8**. 

But reviewing **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (0.73992264) and **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (0.74263619), the combination of both features (amide + nitro) in one molecule would likely sum to ~1.5, with the chloro substitutions pulling it down slightly. 

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 1.5** (midway between the nitro and amide examples, adjusted for chloro). 

However, the molecule is more complex, so a higher value is plausible. 

After reconsidering, the closest analog is **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (6.13432502), which has amide, nitro-like (sulfonamide), and chloro groups. This suggests combined effects can push values much higher. 

Thus, for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, a conservative estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 2.5**. 

Given the data, the most reasonable answer is:  
**2.5**. 

However, looking back at **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (3.45223486), which has two amides and a phenyl, this molecule has one amide and one nitro, so 2.5 seems appropriate. 

**Final Answer: 2.5**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 1.5234952521960652
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** by analyzing structural patterns and their associated property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes/alkenes/aromatics (e.g., CCCC, c1ccccc1, C=Cc1ccccc1)** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**.
2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, esters)** often increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons. For example:
   - **CCCC(O)C=C** → **-0.19820115**
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** → **1.32404766**
3. **Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl)** tend to retain the **-0.67449076** value unless combined with other functional groups.
4. **Phosphorothioate groups (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1)** have a property value of **0.51813545**.
5. **Complex heterocycles (e.g., COc1ncnc2nccnc12)** have higher values (~**1.95486273**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** has:
- Two **phosphorothioate (P(=S)(OC)) groups** (similar to the example with **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a value of **0.51813545**).
- A **thioether (S) linkage** between two aromatic rings.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups beyond the phosphorothioates.

Given the presence of two phosphorothioate groups (which likely increase the property value compared to simple hydrocarbons) and the lack of additional strongly polarizing groups, the property value should be **higher than 0.51813545** but not as high as complex heterocycles (~1.95).

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate, considering the structural similarity to the phosphorothioate example but with an additional phosphorothioate group, is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

This aligns with the trend where phosphorothioates increase the value moderately, and the additional group further elevates it slightly.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.182632885973122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a nitrophenol (specifically, 2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol, depending on substitution). 
   - In the examples, **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a hydroxybenzamide) has a property value of **2.17807401**, and **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene) has a value of **0.74263619**. 
   - Nitrophenol is more polar and acidic than nitrotoluene due to the hydroxyl group, which likely increases the property value compared to nitrotoluene but may not reach as high as hydroxybenzamide (due to the amide group).

2. **Electron-withdrawing groups (NO2)**:
   - The presence of **N(=O)=O** (nitro group) tends to increase the property value when combined with polar groups (e.g., OH). For example:
     - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a value of **1.3081747**.
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a value of **0.74263619**.

3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**:
   - The hydroxyl group adds polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability, increasing the property value. For example:
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **-0.19820115** (less than nitrophenol due to lack of nitro group).
     - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has a value of **-0.19820115**.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitrotoluene (**Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) has a value of **0.74263619**,
- Hydroxybenzamide (**NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**) has a value of **2.17807401**,
- The nitro group and hydroxyl group in **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** will interact synergistically to increase the property value beyond nitrotoluene but likely not as high as hydroxybenzamide (due to the amide's stronger polarity).

A reasonable estimate is **~1.3**, similar to **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (1.3081747), as both have nitro and polar substituents.

### Final Answer:

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 687.0783059535449
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is a highly branched polysaccharide (a sugar derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (O-). 

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) have high property values (5.69512707), indicating that hydroxylation significantly increases the property. The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is even more heavily hydroxylated and has a more complex structure, suggesting an even higher value.

Additionally, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ether and hydroxyl) aligns with higher property values in the examples (e.g., `NC(N)=NC#N` has a high value of 5.34852891 due to polar nitrile and amine groups). 

Given this trend, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely in the range of **6.0 to 7.0**. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be:

**Predicted property value: 6.5967167**  
(This matches the high-end values seen for similarly polar and complex molecules in the dataset.)

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Simple Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptanol-like): -0.19820115  
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long-chain alcohol): -0.19820115  
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (longer-chain alcohol): -0.19820115  
   These suggest that saturated hydrocarbons with a single functional group (e.g., -OH) tend to have values around **-0.198**.

2. **Alkenes and Alkynes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): -0.67449076  
   This suggests that a single double bond in a hydrocarbon chain gives a value around **-0.674**.  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne) has a triple bond, which is more polarizable than a double bond but less than aromatic systems. 

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** (polyaromatic): -0.67449076  
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (aromatic with halogens): -0.67449076  
   Aromatic systems with halogens or no functional groups tend to have values around **-0.674**.

4. **Functional Groups**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dinitrile): 0.99801757 (high due to strong polar groups).  
   - **CC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl ketone): -0.28979861.  
   Carbonyls and nitriles increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- The molecule is a terminal alkyne (no other functional groups).  
- Alkynes are more polarizable than alkanes but less than aromatics or systems with strong functional groups.  
- Comparing to **CCCCCCCCC=C** (-0.674), the triple bond might not lower the value as much as a double bond in a long chain.  
- The closest simple analog is **CC#C** (propyne), which isn't in the examples, but terminal alkynes are somewhat polar.  

Given the lack of strong functional groups and the presence of a triple bond, the value is likely between the alkane-like **-0.198** and the alkene-like **-0.674**. A reasonable estimate is closer to the alkene value but slightly higher due to the triple bond's polarity.  

### Predicted Property Value for **CCC#C**:  
**-0.4** (approximate, similar to **Cc1cncc(C)c1** which is -0.40010115, another unsaturated but not aromatic system).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The property could be related to logP, polarity, or another descriptor, but the pattern suggests higher values for polar/functionalized systems and lower for nonpolar hydrocarbons.)  

---  
**Final Answer**: **-0.4** (closest to the unsaturated, non-aromatic trend).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.2504201961823305
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Group**:  
   - Molecules with a **P=S** group tend to have positive property values.  
     - Example: **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** → **0.51813545**  
     - Example: **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** → **2.95820308**  

2. **Aromatic Chlorine Substitution**:  
   - Multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings often contribute to higher property values, especially when combined with other polar/functional groups.  
     - Example: **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** → **1.3081747**  

3. **Ether Linkage (O-alkyl)**:  
   - Ether linkages (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) can increase the property value when combined with other electronegative atoms (Cl, P=S).  

4. **Alkyl Chains**:  
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CC**, **CCCC**) tend to correlate with lower or negative property values (e.g., **-0.67449076**), but their effect is mitigated when combined with polar groups.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:  
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**  
- Contains a **P=S** group (strong positive contribution).  
- Has an aromatic ring with **three chlorine substitutions** (positive contribution).  
- Includes an **ether linkage** (O-alkyl) and an **ethoxy group (CCOP=)**.
- The **ethyl groups (CC)** are less influential due to the dominance of polar features.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:  
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** → **0.51813545** (P=S + Cl + polar groups).  
- **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** → **1.3081747** (Cl + ether + NO₂).  

Our molecule has **more chlorines** than the first example but lacks the **NO₂** group of the second. The **P=S** group is a stronger contributor than most other polar groups in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the strong influence of **P=S** and **multiple Cl substitutions**, the value is likely between **0.5 and 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted Property Value: 0.93497225**  

This aligns closely with molecules of similar complexity and functional group composition in the dataset.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 2.6321849691553574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - Molecules like `C=C`, `ClCC(C)C`, `Fc1ccccc1Br`, and `CCCCBr` consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These are simple alkanes, alkenes, or halogenated aromatics with no polar or functional groups.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) alone does not seem to change this baseline value unless other functional groups are present.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Simple Substituents**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1Cl` and `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` have a value of **-0.00983745**, suggesting that an amino group (`NH2`) on an aromatic ring slightly increases the property value compared to the baseline.
   - `Clc1ccccc1Cl` and `Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2ccccc2` retain the baseline value of **-0.67449076**, indicating that halogens alone do not affect the property.

3. **Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with amides (`C(=O)N`), nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), or other polar functionalities tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`: **0.23035109** (amide)
     - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`: **2.75212488** (nitro group)
     - `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2`: **7.83259275** (complex heterocycle with multiple nitrogens and carbonyl)
   - Carbonyl groups (`C=O`) in non-amide contexts (e.g., `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1`) give a value of **0.0**.

4. **Complex or Conjugated Systems**:
   - Molecules with extended conjugation or multiple functional groups (e.g., `CC(=O)CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O`) have higher values (**2.58113043**).
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (e.g., `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2`) leads to very high values (**3.6274154**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` has the following features:
- A pyridine ring (`c1nccc...`), which is an aromatic heterocycle (more polar than benzene).
- A **hydrazide group** (`C(=O)NN`), which is a polar functional group with hydrogen-bonding capability (similar to amides but with additional nitrogen).

Given that:
- Simple heterocycles like `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` have a value of **-0.0182135** (close to the amino-aromatic baseline).
- Amides (`C(=O)N`) typically increase the value to the **0.2–0.5 range**.
- The hydrazide (`C(=O)NN`) is even more polar than a simple amide, so we expect a higher value.

### Prediction:
The hydrazide group is highly polar and likely to increase the property value significantly compared to simple amides. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5–1.0**. 

A precise prediction based on the trend is:  
**0.70442805** (similar to `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23`, which has an amide and heterocycle).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` is **0.70442805**.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.5181354489837557
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CC1=CCCCC1, CCCCCOC(=O)CC, C/C1CCCCC1\C)** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076** unless they contain highly polar or reactive functional groups.
2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** significantly increase the property value (e.g., Cc1ccc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O → 5.02712633).
3. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 → 2.93271928)** contribute to higher property values, especially when combined with nitro groups.
4. **Amide/carbamate groups (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C → -0.09362476, CCOC(=O)N → 1.30473643)** can moderately increase the property value.
5. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)** alone do not significantly change the property unless combined with other polar groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**

- It contains a **thiophosphate group (P(=S))**, which is similar to the phosphorus-containing groups in the examples (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)O... → 2.93271928). However, this molecule lacks a nitro group, which was a major contributor to the high value in that case.
- It also has an **amide group (C(=O)N)**, which typically contributes moderately (e.g., CCOC(=O)N → 1.30473643).
- The rest of the molecule is aliphatic (no aromatic rings or additional polar groups).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
1. A **thiophosphate group (P(=S))** (contributing ~1.0-2.0 based on similar examples),
2. An **amide group (C(=O)N)** (contributing ~0.5-1.5),
3. No nitro or other strongly polarizing groups,

the property value is likely in the range of **1.0 to 2.0**. A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**, similar to molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (but higher due to the phosphorus contribution).

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**1.48509939**  
*(This matches the value observed for molecules with similar functional groups, such as thiophosphates and amides, in the given examples.)*

True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple alkanes** (no functional groups) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**:
   - `ClCCBr` (halogenated alkane, treated similarly)
   - `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclohexane)
   - `c1ccsc1` (thiophene, aromatic but simple)
   - `Fc1ccccc1` (fluorobenzene, simple aromatic)
   - `CCCC/C=C/C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon)
   - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclohexane with alkyl chain)

2. **Alcohols (OH-containing)** tend to have a property value of **-0.19820115**:
   - `CCC(O)CC`
   - `CC(C)CO`
   - `CC(C)CCO`
   - `CC(C)(C)CO`
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (phenol derivative)
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (phenol derivative)
   - `c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2` (diphenylmethanol)

3. **More complex or polar functional groups** (nitro, sulfonamide, carbonyl, etc.) lead to higher positive values.

The molecule in question, `CCCCCCCC` (octane), is a **simple alkane with no functional groups**. Based on the examples, simple alkanes consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.687796360927586
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**: 
   - Molecules with steroid-like or polycyclic frameworks (e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**) tend to have property values in the range of **1.0 to 3.5**, especially if they contain polar groups like carbonyls or hydroxyls.
   - Example: **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **1.44938426**.

2. **Hydroxyl and Carbonyl Groups**:
   - The presence of **-OH** and **C=O** groups increases the property value significantly. For instance:
     - **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCCC1)C(=O)N2** has a value of **3.45223486** (due to multiple carbonyls).
     - **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** has a value of **0.44809815** (one carbonyl and one hydroxyl).

3. **Acetylenic Group (C#C)**:
   - The given molecule contains a terminal alkyne (**C#C**). From the examples, alkynes are not explicitly present, but non-polar linear groups (like **C=C**) tend to have low values (e.g., **-0.67449076**). However, the alkyne here is part of a larger polar framework, so its effect may be mitigated.

4. **Similarity to Example Molecules**:
   - The given molecule closely resembles **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property = **0.44809815**), but with an additional hydroxyl and an alkyne. The extra hydroxyl would likely increase the value, while the alkyne might slightly decrease it.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (0.448) but with an additional hydroxyl (increasing polarity) and an alkyne (slightly reducing polarity), the predicted value would likely be **slightly higher than 0.448**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.6 to 1.0**  

For specificity, we can interpolate based on the examples:  
**Final Predicted Value: 0.75**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an empirical estimate based on structural trends in the data.)

True Property: 41.94113593335166
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some key observations:

1. **Aromatic systems (e.g., benzene rings, polyaromatic hydrocarbons)** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**, unless they are substituted with highly polar or functional groups that significantly alter the property.
   - Examples: `c1ccccc1`, `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `Brc1cccc2ccccc12`.

2. **Polar or functionalized aromatic rings** (e.g., with -OH, -Cl, -OCH3) tend to have values around **-0.19820115** or similar.
   - Examples: `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`, `OCc1ccccc1`, `CCCCCC(C)O`.

3. **Highly functionalized or complex heterocycles** (e.g., with multiple N, O, or S atoms, carbonyl groups, or conjugated systems) tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., 2.0 to 13.2).
   - Examples: `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (13.2), `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (3.45), `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (2.75).

4. **Molecules with aliphatic chains or simple functional groups** tend to have values close to **0 or slightly positive/negative**.
   - Examples: `CCCCOCCO` (0.116), `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` (0.0), `CCSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C` (-0.195).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

This is a **highly complex, polyfunctionalized structure** with:
- Multiple aromatic rings (`c1cc...`, `c7cc...`).
- Multiple ether linkages (`OCH3`, `OCO`).
- A carbonyl group (`C=O`).
- Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OH`).
- Fused ring systems and heterocyclic-like features (e.g., `OCOc5cc67`).

Given the complexity and high degree of oxygenation/functionalization, this molecule is most similar to the **higher-valued examples** (e.g., 2.0 to 10.0 range). It does not resemble the simple aromatic systems with -0.674, nor the moderately polar aromatics with ~-0.198. 

### Predicted Property:
Based on the examples, the most reasonable prediction is a value in the **mid-to-high positive range**, similar to other highly functionalized polycyclic systems. A plausible estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.5**  
(Rationale: Comparable to `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (3.45) or `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)c1ccccc1` (3.45), which also have multiple carbonyls and fused rings.)
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. **Phenol derivatives** (with -OH group attached to benzene):
   - `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a value of **2.18263289**
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` also has a value of **2.18263289**
   - `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I` has a value of **0.79096855** (less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but with halogens and nitrile).

2. **Chlorobenzene derivatives**:
   - `Clc1ccccc1I` has a value of **-0.67449076**
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has the same value (**-0.67449076**)
   - `ClC=C` also has **-0.67449076**, suggesting that simple chloroalkenes/arenes tend toward this value.

3. **Combined phenol + chloro-substituted benzene**:
   - The molecule `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is a **4-chlorophenol** (OH and Cl on benzene). 
   - The OH group is electron-donating (+M effect), while Cl is weakly electron-withdrawing (-I effect) but also has +M resonance. 
   - Compared to `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (NO₂ is strongly electron-withdrawing, property = 2.18263289), the Cl substituent is much less electron-withdrawing. 
   - Compared to `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I` (property = 0.79096855), the Cl substituent is also less electron-withdrawing than I and C#N.

Given these observations, the property for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is likely **intermediate** between the strongly electron-withdrawing NO₂ case (2.18263289) and the simple chloroarene case (-0.67449076). 

A reasonable estimate is close to **0.5**, but looking at the data, `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I` (with I and C#N) is 0.79096855, so `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (with only Cl) should be slightly lower. 

However, another reference is `CON(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (property = 0.65906989), which has two Cl atoms and amide groups. Since `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has only one Cl and an OH, its value should be somewhat lower. 

Given the trends, the predicted property for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is approximately:  
**0.5** (but looking for a closer match in the data).

Revisiting the examples, `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I` (0.79096855) is a closer analog, but with less electron-withdrawing ability in `Oc1ccccc1Cl`. 

Thus, a refined estimate is:  
**~0.6** (but likely slightly lower). 

Looking for the closest match in behavior, the predicted property for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is:  
**0.65906989** (same as `CON(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, as both have Cl and polar groups). 

However, since phenol + Cl is less polar than the amide case, a slightly lower value is expected. 

Final prediction:  
**0.5** (but the exact value in the training data for similar structures suggests **0.65906989** may be a repeated pattern). 

Given the data, the most consistent answer is:  
**0.65906989** (same as the CON(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 case, as the model may be assigning similar values for Cl + polar group combinations). 

However, if we strictly interpolate from `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (2.182) and `Clc1ccccc1I` (-0.674), the midpoint is ~0.75, but since Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂, a value closer to 0.6 is reasonable. 

Given the examples, the predicted property for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is:  
**0.65906989** (matching the closest structural analog in the data). 

Thus, the final answer is:  
**0.65906989**

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.496894333242948
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **ClCC#CC**: A chloroalkyne fragment (rare in the examples, but halogens like Cl are present in many low-property-value molecules).
   - **OC(=O)N**: A carbamate group (similar to amides/esters, which appear in molecules with mid-range values, e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has 1.324).
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: A chlorinated aniline (similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` fragments, which often have low values like -0.674).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule has polar groups (carbamate, Cl) but is not overly large or polycyclic (unlike high-value examples like steroids or sugars).
   - No strong hydrogen-bond donors (like multiple OH groups, which correlate with very high values, e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has 14.37).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Cl** and **aromatic rings** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...`) often have values around **-0.674**.
   - Molecules with **carbamate/ester-like groups** (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC`) have values around **1.324**.
   - The presence of both features suggests a balance between these extremes.

4. **Hybrid Case**:
   - The carbamate group may elevate the value slightly compared to plain chlorinated aromatics.
   - No highly electron-withdrawing or complex polycyclic systems are present to push the value higher.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule likely falls in the **mid-low range**, similar to other polar but non-polycyclic molecules. A reasonable estimate is:  
**~0.5 to 1.0**.  

From the examples, the closest analogs are:
- `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (0.496) and `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (0.903), which combine Cl, aromaticity, and polar groups.

Thus, the predicted value for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is:  
**0.75** (approximate midpoint between 0.5 and 1.0).  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.*

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.9043727879105088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**).
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a heterocycle with nitrogen atoms).
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of **two aromatic rings** (both with Cl substituents).
   - A **heterocyclic ring (c2cncnc2)** with nitrogen atoms, which can contribute to polarity/hydrogen bonding.
   - A **hydroxyl group (OH)**, which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - Multiple **chlorine atoms**, which add lipophilicity but also electronegativity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **OH groups and aromatic rings** (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`) have values around **0.6**.
   - Molecules with **heterocycles (nitrogen-containing)** like `Nc1nc[nH]n1` have higher values (**2.59**).
   - Molecules with **multiple aromatic rings and Cl substituents** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`) tend to have the baseline value of **-0.674**.
   - The presence of both **polar (OH, heterocycle) and nonpolar (aromatic, Cl)** groups suggests a balance, likely leading to a value between **0.5 and 2.5**.

4. **Closest Analogues**:
   - `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (value = **2.032**) has a similar combination of aromatic rings, Cl, and a heterocycle.
   - `O=C1N(COC(=O)C)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (value = **3.507**) has multiple aromatic rings and polar groups, but our molecule lacks the additional carbonyls.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with values in the **1.5 to 2.5 range**, and balancing the polar (OH, heterocycle) and nonpolar (aromatic, Cl) contributions, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.85**  

This accounts for:
- The **OH group** increasing polarity (~+0.6 effect).
- The **heterocycle (c2cncnc2)** adding ~+1.5 (similar to other N-heterocycles).
- The **two Cl-substituted aromatic rings** partially offsetting with lipophilicity (~-0.67 baseline).

Thus, **1.85** is a plausible intermediate value.

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics without polar functional groups** (e.g., CCCCBr, C1CCCCCCC1, C=Cc1ccccc1) tend to have the property value **-0.67449076**.
2. **Molecules with ester groups (RCOOR')**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (methyl acetate) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...** (more complex esters) have higher values, but this is likely due to additional functional groups.
3. **Aldehydes (R-CHO)**:
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal) has a value of **-0.28979861**.
4. **Ethers (R-O-R')**:
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1** (an ether with additional polar groups) has a higher value, but simple ethers are not explicitly listed.
5. **Formates (HCOOR)**:
   - No direct example, but **CCCCOC=O** is a formate ester (butyl formate), analogous to methyl acetate (CC(=O)OCC, value = 0.0).

### Prediction for **CCCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is a simple ester (like methyl acetate) but with a longer alkyl chain (butyl group instead of methyl). 
- The presence of the formyl group (**HC=O**) might slightly increase the property compared to methyl acetate, but the lack of additional polar groups suggests it won't deviate significantly from **0.0**.
- The closest analog is **CC(=O)OCC** (methyl acetate, value = 0.0), and **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal, value = -0.28979861). Since butyl formate is an ester (more polar than an aldehyde but less polar than nitro or amide groups), a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than heptanal but similar to methyl acetate.

### Final Prediction:
Given the data, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **0.0**. 

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar measure, esters typically have values around 0.0 to 1.0, aligning with this prediction.)

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values:

1. Simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClCCCl, CCBr, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl) consistently show a property value of -0.67449076 when they contain no other functional groups.

2. The molecule "ClCCl" (dichloromethane) fits this pattern perfectly - it's a simple chlorinated alkane with no additional functional groups or complex structures.

3. Other molecules with this exact value (-0.67449076) share the characteristics of being either:
   - Simple halogenated alkanes (ClCCCl, CCBr, C1Cc2ccccc2C1)
   - Simple unsaturated hydrocarbons (CCCCCC=C, C=CCCC=C)
   - Simple brominated/chlorinated aromatics without other functional groups (Cc1ccccc1Br)

Given that "ClCCl" is structurally simpler than even "ClCCCl" (which had the -0.67449076 value), and follows the same pattern of being a simple chlorinated alkane, we can confidently predict the same property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is: -0.67449076
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

1. Simple aromatic alcohols (e.g., Cc1ccc(C)cc1O) tend to have property values around -0.19820115 (as seen in CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O and similar structures).

2. The presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group on an aromatic ring generally increases the property value compared to similar structures without -OH.

3. Methyl substitutions on aromatic rings don't dramatically change the property value when an -OH is present.

4. Comparing with similar structures:
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O: -0.19820115
   - c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2: 0.60198581 (higher due to two -OH groups)
   - Cc1ccc(C)cc1O is very similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, just with slightly different methyl positioning

Given that Cc1cccc(C)c1O has:
- An aromatic ring
- One hydroxyl group
- Two methyl groups (one different position than the reference example)

The most similar reference compound is CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with -0.19820115. The slightly different methyl positioning in our target molecule shouldn't significantly change this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is: -0.19820115

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property value **-0.67449076** appears frequently for molecules with certain structural features:

1. **Highly halogenated aromatic systems** (e.g., multiple Cl or Br substitutions on benzene rings).  
   - Example: `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **-0.67449076**  
   - Example: `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br` → **-0.67449076**  

2. **Symmetric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., fused benzene rings without polar substituents).  
   - Example: `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24` → **-0.67449076**  

3. **Non-polar aliphatic chains or branched hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CC(C)C(C)C(C)C` or `CCCCl`).  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:  
The molecule **`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`** is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with:  
- Two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl core).  
- **Five chlorine atoms** distributed across both rings (highly halogenated).  
- Symmetric substitution pattern (similar to other examples with the recurring value).  

### Prediction:  
This structure fits the pattern of other molecules assigned **-0.67449076**. Thus, the predicted property value is:  

**-0.67449076**  

### Supporting Observations:  
- The value seems associated with **low polarity, high halogenation, and aromaticity**.  
- No conflicting examples (e.g., polar groups like `NO2` or `OH` would deviate from this value).  
- The recurring value suggests it may represent a **binary or categorical property** (e.g., "non-polar/halogenated" vs. "polar").

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics without polar groups)** tend to have the property value **-0.67449076**:
   - Examples: 
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` (polycyclic aromatic, -0.67449076)
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (alkyl-substituted benzene, -0.67449076)
     - `CCCCCCCCC=C` (alkene, -0.67449076)
     - `CCCCCCCC` (alkane, -0.67449076)
     - `Cc1ccccc1C` (toluene derivative, -0.67449076).

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups** deviate from this value (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, halogens, etc.).

3. **CC=C(C)C** is a simple alkene (isobutylene) with no polar functional groups, similar to the hydrocarbons above.

### Prediction:
Since **CC=C(C)C** is structurally analogous to the simple hydrocarbons in the dataset (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC=C`), its property value is likely the same as the recurring value for non-polar hydrocarbons:  
**-0.67449076**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Simple halogenated alkanes** (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl) tend to have property values around **-0.67449076**.
2. **Molecules with a single polar group (e.g., OH, Cl)** often have values around **-0.19820115** (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)CO, CCCCCCO, Oc1ccc(O)cc1).
3. **Small, symmetric halogenated molecules** (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl) tend to cluster around **-0.67449076**.

### Analysis of ClCCl:
- It is a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorine atoms (similar to ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl but simpler).
- It lacks additional functional groups (like OH or aromatic rings) that would push the value toward -0.19820115.
- The closest analogs in the dataset are simple halogenated alkanes, which consistently show values around **-0.67449076**.

### Predicted property value:
**-0.67449076** (matching the trend for small, symmetric halogenated alkanes).

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** with multiple Cl substituents tend to have property values around **-0.19820115**. For example:
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **-0.19820115**.
   - **OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** also has a value of **-0.19820115**.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (not chlorinated but shares structural simplicity) also has **-0.19820115**.

2. The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is structurally very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, differing only in the position of one chlorine atom (shifted from meta to para). Since the substitution pattern is nearly identical (three Cl atoms on a phenol ring), we can reasonably expect the property value to be similar.

3. The presence of the **OH group** and **Cl substituents** does not drastically alter the property in these cases, as seen in the examples.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is:

**-0.19820115**

True Property: 41.94113593335166
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: Similar to examples like `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (2.18263289) and `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (-0.19820115), where hydroxyl and methoxy groups contribute to higher property values.
2. **Multiple oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., furan-like OCO rings)**: Seen in `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (89.05399284), where such groups significantly increase the property value.
3. **Ketone (C=O) groups**: Present in examples like `CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C` (5.56577641), which contribute to higher values.
4. **Polycyclic framework**: Similar to steroid-like structures in examples like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (6.5967167), which have moderately high values.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule combines features from high-value examples (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, ketones, and complex oxygen-rich rings) but is less extreme than `OCC1OC(...)C1O` (89.05399284).
- It resembles `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (6.5967167) in complexity but has more oxygenated groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and the polycyclic structure, the property value is likely high but not as extreme as the largest example. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 7.5** (interpolating between the steroid-like examples and the highly oxygenated sugar-like structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 3.273642084783638
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (S-CH3)** group attached. The ring system is **1,2,4-thiadiazole** (or a derivative) with substitutions:
   - A **carbonyl (=O)** group.
   - An **amino (NH)** group.
   - A bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** group.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Thioether (S-CH3)**: Present in some examples (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` with property **0.11912312**).
   - **Amide-like (=O and NH)**: Similar to `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property **3.0378254**) and `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (property **3.04008934**).
   - **Bulky tert-butyl**: Adds hydrophobicity but may not drastically change the property if the polar groups dominate.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analogs are heterocycles with **NH and =O** groups, such as:
     - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1`: **3.0378254**
     - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`: **3.04008934**
     - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C`: **2.79467923** (also has a tert-butyl and similar ring).
   - The **S-CH3** group may slightly reduce the property compared to pure N/O heterocycles (as sulfur is less polar than oxygen).

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to the above examples (especially the **3.0378254** and **3.04008934** values), and accounting for the **S-CH3** group's modest reduction, the predicted property is likely slightly lower than 3.0 but still in the same range. 

**Final Prediction**: **2.85** (approximate, based on structural analogs). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of polar heterocycles with NH/=O groups and bulky substituents in the given data.)

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CC, CCCC, CCC(C)(C)C)**: These typically have property values around **-0.67449076**, indicating that saturated hydrocarbons with no functional groups tend to have this baseline value.

2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., c1ccccc1, c1ccc2ccccc12)**: Pure aromatic systems (without polar substituents) also tend to have values around **-0.67449076**.

3. **Functional Groups Impact**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group (especially in esters or ketones) often increases the property value. For example:
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** has a value of **0.0**.
     - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** has a value of **0.30618981**.
   - **Ester Group (-COOR)**: Esters seem to have a moderate effect. For example:
     - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** has a value of **1.55789029**.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** has a very high value (**17.1882552**), but this is likely due to the additional complex substituents (e.g., S(=O)(=O), Cl, etc.).

4. **Ethyl Ester of Benzoic Acid (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)**:
   - This is an ester derivative of benzoic acid (ethyl benzoate). 
   - Comparing to simpler esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC (0.0)** and aromatic esters like **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (0.30618981)**, we can infer that the aromatic ring + ester group would likely give a value slightly higher than 0.0 but not as high as more polar/complex esters.

### Prediction:
Given the structure **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, it is an aromatic ester with no additional polar or complex substituents. Based on the examples:
- The ester group alone (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) gives **0.0**.
- Adding an aromatic ring (e.g., **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) gives **~0.306**.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** would be slightly higher than 0.0 but less than 0.5. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures). 

However, looking more closely at **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (0.30618981)**, which has two carbonyls (one ketone, one ester), our molecule has only one ester, so the value should be slightly lower. 

A more precise estimate would be **~0.20**. 

But since the examples show **CCCC(=O)OCC = 0.0** and **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O = 0.306**, and our molecule is intermediate (one ester + aromatic), a reasonable compromise is:

**Final predicted property value: 0.15** (conservative estimate). 

However, given the lack of exact matches, the closest reasonable guess is **0.0 to 0.3**. 

Given the data, I would predict: **0.25**. 

But to align with the closest simpler ester example (**CCCC(=O)OCC = 0.0**), and accounting for the aromatic ring, the value is likely slightly higher. 

**Final answer: 0.20**. 

(Note: Without an exact match or a clear trendline, this is an approximate interpolation.) 

However, reviewing again, **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (0.306)** is a closer match (aromatic + ester), so **0.30** is also plausible. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is: **0.25**. 

But the most precise guess based on the closest example is: **0.30**. 

Thus, the predicted value is: **0.30**.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aliphatic chains with a single functional group at the end tend to have property values around -0.29 (e.g., CCCC(=O)CCC, -0.28979861; CCCCC(=O)CCCC, -0.28979861).

2. When the terminal group is a halogen (Cl, Br, I), the property value tends to be -0.67449076 (e.g., CSSC, -0.67449076; Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, -0.67449076; Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, -0.67449076; CI, -0.67449076).

3. The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a simple aliphatic chain (heptyl) with a bromine atom at the terminal position, similar to other halogen-terminated molecules in the dataset.

Given this pattern, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr would be:

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for very small, simple molecules with no functional groups or only a single oxygen (like methanol, **CH3OH**, or in this case, **CO**) tends to be **0.0** or close to it. 

For example:
- **CCCCOC=O** (a simple aldehyde) has a property value of **0.0**.
- **CO** is even simpler, with just a single carbon and oxygen (formaldehyde if written as **CH2O**, but here it's likely carbon monoxide). Given its simplicity and lack of additional functional groups, the predicted property value would likely be **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CO** is:  
**0.0**
