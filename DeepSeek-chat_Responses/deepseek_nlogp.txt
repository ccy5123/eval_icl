SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6575908591326393
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain with Ester Group**: The molecule has a long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**CC(=O)OC**). 
   - Similar molecules in the dataset:
     - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (given) is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (which has a property value of **1.19140876** in the dataset).
     - Another similar molecule is **CCOC(=O)CC** (shorter chain, property value: **-0.94386286**), but the long chain dominates the property.

2. **Effect of Chain Length**:
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains tend to increase the property value (e.g., **CCCCCC** has **0.16940953**, while **CCCCCC(C)C** has **0.60463328**).
   - The ester group (**=O)OC**) also contributes positively when paired with a long chain (as seen in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** with **1.19140876**).

3. **Comparison to Closest Example**:
   - The molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is almost identical to the example **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (property: **1.19140876**), except for the chain length. Here, the chain is slightly longer (10 carbons vs. 12 carbons in the given molecule).
   - Longer chains generally increase the property value slightly, but the ester group's contribution remains similar.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong similarity to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (value: **1.19140876**) and the slightly longer chain, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** would be **slightly higher**, likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.3**.

However, since the dataset already includes **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** with a value of **1.19140876**, and the given molecule is identical, the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: 1.19140876**  

(Note: If the given molecule were longer, e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, the value would increase slightly, but as written, it matches the example exactly.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3862345645410203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic System with Heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a fused bicyclic system with a benzene ring and a lactam-like ring (containing O and NH). This is somewhat similar to the structure **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: -2.7276576), which also has multiple carbonyls and nitrogens, but our molecule is less polar and has a chlorine substituent.
2. **Chlorine Substituent**: The presence of a chlorine atom on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl**: 2.45630131). However, the effect is modulated by other polar groups.
3. **Lactam-like Ring (oc(=O)[nH])**: This introduces polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability, which typically lowers the property value (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)**: -2.7276576). However, the aromaticity and chlorine may offset this.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (2.48243799): Highly chlorinated, very high value.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (-2.7276576): Highly polar, very low value.
- **c1cncnc1** (-1.27426617): Aromatic with nitrogens, moderately low.
- **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (1.5874959): Chlorinated phenol, high but not as extreme as fully chlorinated aromatics.

Our molecule is intermediate: it has one chlorine (increasing the value) but also a polar lactam-like ring (decreasing the value). The aromaticity adds some stability but not as much as fully chlorinated systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the chlorine (increasing) and the polar lactam (decreasing), the value is likely **moderately positive but not extreme**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.75**  

This is based on:
- Chlorine contribution (~+1 to +2, but only one Cl).
- Lactam/polar group contribution (~-1 to -2).
- Aromaticity adding slight stability (~+0.5).

Thus, **0.75** is a plausible intermediate value.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.1409143248399483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of **-1.5373983**.
     - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a value of **-1.94848325**.
   - The presence of nitro groups seems to significantly reduce the property value.

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl groups (e.g., `CCCOCC`, `CCC(C)CC`) tend to have values close to zero or slightly negative.
   - Branching (e.g., `CC(C)N(=O)=O`) may slightly modulate the effect but is secondary to the nitro group's influence.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature likely dominates the property value.
   - The isopropyl group (`CC(C)`) is not strongly influential compared to the nitro group.

### Prediction for CC(C)N(=O)=O:
Given the strong negative contribution of the nitro group and the modest effect of the isopropyl group, the property value should be **negative and moderately large**, similar to other nitro-containing molecules in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-1.0 and -1.5**, leaning toward the more negative side due to the lack of mitigating polar or aromatic features. 

Comparing to `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-1.537), which has additional heteroatoms and a ring, `CC(C)N(=O)=O` might be slightly less negative but still in the same range.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.2** (approximate, likely between -1.1 and -1.4). 

For specificity, we'll predict:  
**-1.25** (consistent with the trend of nitroalkanes in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the clear trend that nitro groups correlate with strongly negative values in the given data.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.22421446731637334
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid derivative with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group, which suggests significant polarity and complexity.

Breaking it down:
1. **Core structure**: The molecule is a polycyclic steroid-like structure (tetracyclic terpenoid), similar to some of the more complex examples (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`, which has a property value of **1.63149038**). This suggests a high baseline value due to the ring system.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A hydroxyl group (`C(O)`) increases polarity (likely contributing positively to the property).
   - A carbonyl group (`C(=O)CO`) also increases polarity and adds to the property value.
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like halogens or nitro groups) are present, but the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups are significant.
3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - The molecule is more complex than `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property: **1.63149038**) due to the additional hydroxyl group and the `C(=O)CO` side chain.
   - It is less complex than `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property: **3.82361956**), which has many heavy halogens.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` would likely be in the range of **1.8 to 2.2**. A reasonable estimate is **2.0**, considering the balance of complexity and polar functional groups.

**Final predicted property value: 2.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples).

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.849168676796918
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings generally contribute positively to the property, especially when substituted with halogens (e.g., Cl or Br), as seen in examples like:
   - Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.78971113)
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.44774473)
   - Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.59703858).

2. **Halogen Substituents**: 
   - Fluorine substituents (F) are present on one ring. From the example FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 (0.25069326), fluorine seems to contribute less than chlorine or bromine.
   - A chlorine substituent (Cl) is present on the other ring, which typically adds ~0.4â€“0.8 to the property (as seen in the examples above).

3. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (C(=O)N), which are polar and may reduce the property slightly. Examples with amide-like groups:
   - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (-0.68208545)
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (-1.47685971)
   suggest that such groups can lower the property.

4. **Combined Features**: The molecule combines halogenated aromatic rings (positive contribution) with polar amide groups (negative contribution). This is somewhat similar to:
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.44774473) but with additional polar groups reducing the value.
   - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (-0.68208545) but with more halogenated aromatic rings increasing the value.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the positive contributions from the halogenated aromatic rings and the negative contributions from the amide groups, the property value is likely to be in the **low positive range**. 

Comparing to similar molecules:
- The chlorine-substituted ring alone might contribute ~0.4â€“0.5.
- The fluorine-substituted ring might add ~0.2â€“0.3.
- The two amide groups could subtract ~0.5â€“0.7.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is **~0.1 to 0.3**. 

Looking at the examples, the closest analog is perhaps **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.44774473)** but with additional polar groups, so we adjust downward. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.15** (specific estimate based on balancing the contributions). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The property could be something like logP, but the exact interpretation isn't specified.)

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.35414528008225327
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderately negative property values. For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate, though an ester, has an ether-like linkage): **-0.94386286**
     - **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (a complex ether/amide): **0.08545739**
     - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sugar-like polyether): **-4.05351294** (very negative due to multiple polar groups).
   - Ethers without strong polar or functionalized groups (like **CCCOC(C)C**) are less polar and likely have less negative values.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to increase the property value (make it less negative or more positive). For example:
     - **CCCCCC1CCCC1**: **0.97013638** (purely hydrocarbon)
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: **-0.26786684** (branched with one -OH)
   - **CCCOC(C)C** has a short hydrocarbon chain (propyl + isopropyl), so it won't contribute strongly to a positive value.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branched molecules (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: **0.77294807**) often have higher values than linear ones, but this is offset by the ether group's polarity.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol): **-0.366461**
   - **CCCCCO** (linear alcohol): **-0.80059002**
   - **CCCOC(C)C** is less polar than an alcohol but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon, so its value should lie between these two.

### Prediction:
Given the ether group's moderate polarity and the short/branched hydrocarbon chains, the property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is likely slightly negative but not as negative as alcohols or polyethers. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where simple ethers have values in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**, depending on branching and chain length.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.5203253527761822
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (uracil-like) ring** with substitutions:
   - A **bromine (Br)** at one position.
   - A **methyl (C)** group at another position.
   - A **tert-butyl (CCC(C))** group attached to a nitrogen.
   - Two **carbonyl (C=O)** groups in the ring.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The presence of **Br** and **C=O** groups suggests moderate polarity.
   - The **tert-butyl group** adds hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar carbonyls and Br.
   - The structure resembles some of the heterocyclic examples in the dataset (e.g., N-containing rings with halogens).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (3.376)**: Highly chlorinated, very hydrophobic. Our molecule is less hydrophobic but has polar groups.
- **Nc1nccs1 (-1.104)**: Small polar heterocycle; our molecule is larger and more substituted.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.448)**: Dichlorobenzene; our molecule has more polar features but similar halogen presence.
- **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.047)**: Contains Br and amide; our molecule has more complex heterocyclic features.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of **hydrophobicity (tert-butyl)**, **polarity (C=O, Br)**, and **heterocyclic nature**, the property value is likely in the **low-to-moderate positive range**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property: 0.25 Â± 0.15**  

*(This is based on interpolation between similar structures in the dataset. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)*  

---  
**Final Answer**: **0.25** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.6941959064363495
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values around **0.1 to 0.8**, depending on substituents. 
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) have higher values (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** has a value of **3.13380257**).

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a naphthalene-like structure with extended conjugation) has a value of **1.63484299**.
   - **Cc1cc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted benz[a]anthracene-like structure) has a value of **1.3427005**.
   - Biphenyl is simpler than these but still has two conjugated rings, suggesting a value between **0.5 and 1.5**.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl) tend to lower the value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has **-0.57199663**).
   - Biphenyl has no substituents, so the value should reflect pure conjugation.

4. **Direct Comparison**:
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a benzene ring with a cyclohexane substituent) has a value of **0.15490435**, which is lower due to lack of conjugation.
   - Biphenyl has more conjugation, so its value should be higher.

### Prediction:
Given that biphenyl is a simple conjugated system with two benzene rings, its property value should be higher than mono-aromatic systems but lower than larger polycyclic aromatics. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2: 0.85**  

This is consistent with the trend where extended conjugation increases the property value, but not as much as fused polycyclic systems.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.4260553823555239
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics)**:
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (bicyclo[4.4.0]decane): 0.703  
     (cyclic, saturated hydrocarbon)
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.016  
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): 0.605  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with ethyl substituent): 0.436  
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene): 0.817  
   - **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (naphthalene): 0.343  
   - **CCCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 0.338  

   Hydrocarbons generally have positive property values, with linear/branched alkanes/alkenes in the range of ~0.0 to ~0.8, and cyclic/aromatic structures tending toward higher values.

2. **Oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, ethers, carbonyls)**:
   - **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** (tertiary alcohol): -0.633  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ester): -0.611  
   - **Oc1ccccc1O** (catechol): -0.849  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol): -0.169  
   - **CC1CO1** (epoxide): -1.323  

   Oxygen-containing functional groups (especially alcohols, esters, and epoxides) tend to reduce the property value, often making it negative.

3. **Nitrogen-containing groups (amines, amides, nitro)**:
   - **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -1.983  
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.285  
   - **Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O**: -2.541  

   Nitrogen-containing groups (especially amines and nitro) strongly reduce the property value, often making it highly negative.

4. **Sulfur-containing groups**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**: -1.018  
   - **CCNC(=S)NCC**: -1.265  
   - **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1**: -1.093  
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: 2.108  

   Sulfur-containing groups show variability:
     - Thiols/thioamides (e.g., C=S, -SH) tend to reduce the property value (negative).
     - Phosphorothioates (P=S) can increase the property value (positive), especially with aromatic systems.

5. **Halogen-containing groups (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**: 2.482  
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: 2.456  
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: 1.789  

   Highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) aromatic systems significantly increase the property value (>1.5).

### Analysis of **CCCCS**:
- **Structure**: Linear aliphatic thiol (butyl mercaptan, C4H9SH).
- **Key features**:
  1. Aliphatic hydrocarbon chain (similar to alkanes, which have positive values ~0.0 to ~0.8).
  2. Terminal thiol (-SH) group, which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds (similar to alcohols, which reduce the property value).
  3. Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the effect of -SH is less pronounced than -OH but still negative.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** (tertiary alcohol): -0.633  
  (Alcohol reduces property value significantly.)
- **CCNC(=S)NCC** (thioamide): -1.265  
  (C=S group reduces property value strongly.)
- **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.016  
  (Pure hydrocarbon, no heteroatoms.)

Given that **CCCCS** is a thiol (less polar than an alcohol but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon), I expect its property value to be slightly negative but not as low as alcohols or thioamides.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCCS**:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.25** (between the slightly positive values of alkanes and the more negative values of alcohols/thioamides).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCS** is **-0.25**.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.36536626654544674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 0.07081537
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (more branched alkane): 0.77294807
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): 0.28305623
   - **CC/C=C\C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon, different stereochemistry): -0.25076168
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ester): -0.6769539
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (branched alcohol): -0.26786684
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (branched alcohol): -0.63336995

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohol groups (**-OH**) tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: -0.26786684, **CC(C)CC(C)O**: -0.63336995).
   - Branched alkanes without polar groups tend to have positive values (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.07081537, **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.77294807).

3. **Impact of Oxygen**:
   - The presence of oxygen (especially in alcohols or esters) generally reduces the property value, as seen in the examples above.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched hydrocarbon with a terminal alcohol group (**-OH**).
- It is structurally similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property: -0.26786684) and **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property: -0.63336995), but with a longer carbon chain and slightly different branching.
- The terminal **-OH** group will likely reduce the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.77294807).
- The longer carbon chain may slightly offset the reduction caused by the **-OH** group compared to **CC(C)CC(C)O** (-0.63336995).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above trends, the property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.5536735771796003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **Benzene (c1ccccc1)**: Property = -0.44637632
   - **Naphthalene-like systems (e.g., Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1)**: 
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): Property = 0.76469654
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like): Property = 1.3427005
   - Aromatic systems with more rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) tend to have higher property values than benzene alone, especially with alkyl substitutions.

2. **Methyl Substitutions**:
   - Adding methyl groups to aromatic systems generally increases the property value:
     - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): -0.44637632
     - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not directly given, but similar to **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (xylene-like): 0.18669258
     - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.02433038 (less impact due to fewer rings)

3. **Specific Case for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
   - This is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (methyl group on one benzene ring of naphthalene).
   - Compare to:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**: 0.76469654 (methyl-substituted naphthalene with an additional methyl)
     - **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (naphthalene): Not given, but likely higher than benzene (-0.446) but lower than methyl-substituted naphthalene.
   - The given molecule has one fewer methyl group than **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**, so the property value should be slightly lower than 0.76469654 but still significantly higher than benzene.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Naphthalene core increases the property compared to benzene.
- Methyl substitution further increases the property.
- The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is intermediate between naphthalene and dimethyl-substituted naphthalene.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.5 to 0.7**. Looking at the examples, **0.6** is a plausible prediction. However, the closest analog is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (0.76469654), and with one fewer methyl group, the value might be slightly lower. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is approximately **0.65**.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.6759275931090769
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-1.64496925**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with **C(C)CCC** (a branched alkyl chain) and **CC=C** (an alkenyl group). 
   - Compared to the example molecule (which has **CC=C** and a methyl group), this molecule has a longer/bulkier alkyl substituent (**C(C)CCC**).

3. **Polarity and Hydrophobicity**:
   - The hydantoin core is polar due to the carbonyl and NH groups.
   - The **C(C)CCC** and **CC=C** substituents are hydrophobic but not as extreme as fully nonpolar chains (e.g., pure hydrocarbons like **CCCCCCCCCCCCCC**, which has a high value of 2.30468115).
   - The additional alkyl chain (**C(C)CCC**) will increase hydrophobicity slightly compared to the example with just **CC=C** and a methyl group.

4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (-1.64496925). Adding a **C(C)CCC** group (more hydrophobic than just a methyl) would likely increase the property value slightly (less negative).
   - Another similar molecule is **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2** (1.55013823), which has alkenes and aromatic rings but is much more hydrophobic. This suggests that alkenes alone don't dominate the property.
   - The presence of polar groups (carbonyls, NH) pulls the value down, while alkyl/alkene groups push it up.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (-1.64496925) but with a slightly more hydrophobic substituent (**C(C)CCC**), the property value should be **less negative** but still in the same general range. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-1.2 to -1.4**

Looking at the examples, a good fit is:  
**-1.35**

### Final Answer:
Predicted property value: **-1.35**

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.25069325854354274
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., long aliphatic chains, polyaromatics) tend to have higher property values.  
   - Example: `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (polyaromatic) has a high value of **2.2588**.  
   - `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` (ester with a medium chain) has a low value of **-0.1431**.

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (e.g., halogens, nitro, carbonyl)**:  
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) generally increase the property value, especially when multiple are present.  
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene) has a very high value of **3.3766**.  
     - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (chloro-iodobenzene) has **0.4144**.  
   - Fluorine is less impactful than heavier halogens but still contributes.  

3. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -COO, -O-)**:  
   - These decrease the property value (e.g., `CCO` = **-1.6013**, `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` = **-4.0535**).  

4. **Aromatic Rings**:  
   - Simple benzene rings with small substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1CC`) have modest values (~**0.3232**).  
   - Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`) would likely increase the value compared to plain benzene but not as much as heavy halogens.  

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is benzene substituted with a **trifluoromethyl (-CF3)** group, which is strongly electron-withdrawing but less bulky than heavy halogens.  
- Compared to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (value = **0.4144**), the -CF3 group is less polarizable than iodine but more electron-withdrawing than chlorine.  
- The property value should be **lower than hexachlorobenzene (3.3766)** but **higher than plain benzene derivatives (~0.3)**.  

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.65 Â± 0.15**  

### Final Answer:  
**0.65**
==================================================
Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -3.8044617762159207
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and overall hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. The molecule in question, **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, is a sugar derivative (specifically a hexose sugar like glucose or mannitol) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding.

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = -4.05351294) have very low (negative) property values, likely reflecting high hydrophilicity or some measure of solvation energy/logP.
- The presence of aromatic rings or hydrophobic groups (e.g., **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**, property = 0.69419591) tends to increase the property value.

The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **five -OH groups** and a cyclic structure, similar to the polyol example but with slightly fewer -OH groups than **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (which has six -OH groups and a property of -4.05351294). 

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong trend of decreasing property values with increasing -OH groups, I predict a value slightly higher (less negative) than -4.05351294 but still strongly negative. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -3.5**  

This accounts for the cyclic structure (which may slightly reduce the polarity compared to the linear polyol) while retaining the dominant effect of the multiple -OH groups.

Iteration: 15
SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -0.14409388714320445
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key observations about this molecule:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The core is a polycyclic steroid skeleton (similar to some of the higher-valued examples like `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` and `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`).
2. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: These are polar and can contribute to higher property values (as seen in other examples with C=O groups).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (O-H)**: These are highly polar and can lower the property value (as seen in polyol examples like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` with very negative values).
4. **Conjugated systems**: The `C=CC=C` fragment suggests some electron delocalization, which may influence the property.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a property value of **1.71126886**. This is a steroid-like molecule with carbonyl groups and no hydroxyls.
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a property value of **1.32072379**. This is also a steroid-like molecule with one hydroxyl and one carbonyl.
- `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a property value of **-4.05351294**, but this is an extreme case due to its many hydroxyls and no hydrophobic regions.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- A steroid-like core (increasing the value).
- Two carbonyl groups (increasing the value).
- Two hydroxyl groups (decreasing the value, but not as drastically as in the polyol case).
- Some conjugation (minor effect).

Given these factors, the property value should be **between 1.0 and 1.5**, closer to the steroid-like examples with mixed polar groups. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.45**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would differ.)

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 1.1084829371353542
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an oxygen-containing functional group (OH), and a carbonyl group (C=O). 

Breaking it down:
1. **Molecular complexity**: The molecule has a fused polycyclic structure (4 rings), which tends to increase the property value (as seen with other polycyclic examples like `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` with a value of 0.55367358 or `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` with a value of 1.63484299).
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - The hydroxyl group (`OH`) is present, which is polar and can contribute positively (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has a value of -0.20074618, but larger polycyclic structures with OH groups like `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` have a value of 0.86907909).
   - The carbonyl group (`C=O`) is also present, which can contribute to the property value (e.g., `CC1=C(SCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2` has a value of 0.19226202).
3. **Comparison to similar structures**: 
   - The molecule is structurally similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (value = 0.86907909), but with an additional carbonyl group and slightly more complexity. This suggests a higher value.
   - The presence of multiple fused rings and polar groups aligns with higher values in the examples (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has a value of 2.03537747 due to halogenation and fused rings).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.6**. A reasonable estimate would be **1.45**, considering the balance between the polar groups and the polycyclic complexity. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5376494611449667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (similar to amide groups in other examples).
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O), which is also present in several examples (e.g., O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 with -0.509, COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O with -0.503).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which would decrease electron density on the aromatic ring.
   - The acetamide group is moderately electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl (C=O) but can also donate electrons via resonance (NH).

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (nitrobenzene): Property = -0.509.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitroanisole): Property = -0.503.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1** (N-phenylacetamide): Not explicitly given, but amides with aromatic rings tend to have negative values (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 = 0.021, which is less negative due to aliphatic chain).
   - **CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1**: Not given, but aliphatic amides are less negative than aromatic ones.

   The presence of both nitro and acetamide groups suggests a more negative property than nitrobenzene or nitroanisole alone due to additive electron-withdrawing effects.

4. **Hybrid Effects**:
   - The nitro group dominates the polarity, but the acetamide adds additional negative contribution.
   - No strongly hydrophobic (e.g., long aliphatic chains) or bulky groups are present to offset the polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value is likely more negative than nitrobenzene (-0.509) but not as extreme as highly polar/aliphatic molecules like COCOC (-1.438). A reasonable estimate is between **-0.7 and -0.9**.

Looking at similar molecules:
- **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (aldehyde + methoxy): -0.568.
- **CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1**: Likely less negative (no nitro group).
- **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2**: -0.842 (similar nitro + amide combination).

Thus, the predicted property for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (estimated based on structural similarity and additive effects of nitro and acetamide groups).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.2980081353246586
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is a moderately polar and somewhat bulky group. Similar phosphorus-containing groups in the dataset are not present, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CSSC**) have property values around **-0.486**. Phosphorus might add slight polarity but not drastically change the property.
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC)**: Sulfur-carbon bonds are present in molecules like **CSSC** (property **-0.486**), suggesting a modest contribution.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc)**: Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**, **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**) have property values ranging from **0.789 to 0.894**. The presence of Cl on an aromatic ring tends to increase the property value.
4. **Lactam-like heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2)**: This is a polar heterocycle with an amide-like carbonyl. Similar polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1**) have negative property values (e.g., **-1.491**), but here it's part of a larger conjugated system, which may reduce its impact.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Ether/alcohol fragments (e.g., **CCO**, **CCCO**) tend to decrease the property (values around **-1.334** to **-0.266**), but their effect is diluted in larger molecules.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the dataset is **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (property **0.789**), which shares the chlorinated aromatic feature. However, the additional polar/thiophosphate groups in the query molecule would likely reduce the property value somewhat.
- The presence of **P=S** and **SC** might pull the value toward the range seen for sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., **-0.486** for **CSSC**), but the aromatic Cl would counterbalance this.

### Synthesis:
The molecule combines:
1. A **chlorinated aromatic** (tending to increase the property, e.g., +0.7 to +0.9).
2. **Polar/thiophosphate groups** (tending to decrease the property, e.g., -0.4 to -0.5).
3. A **heterocycle** (moderate impact, likely slight decrease).

Given these competing effects, the property value is likely **slightly positive but closer to neutral**. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.25** (with uncertainty Â±0.2). 

This balances the Cl-aromatic contribution (~+0.8) against the polar/thiophosphate groups (~-0.5) and the heterocycle (~-0.1). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate).

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8991841713371275
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: Property = -0.00095789  
   - **CC(C)CO**: Property = -1.16609312  
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = -0.26786684  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: Property = -4.05351294 (highly negative due to multiple -OH groups)  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (like **CC(C)CO** but more branched).

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to decrease the property value (make it more negative). For example:
     - **CCC** (linear): -0.63131733  
     - **CC(C)CO** (branched): -1.16609312  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched than **CC(C)CO**, so we expect a more negative value.

3. **Tertiary Alcohols**:
   - Tertiary alcohols (like **CC(C)(C)CO**) typically have more negative property values than secondary or primary alcohols due to increased steric hindrance and reduced polarity.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol, secondary alcohol): -1.16609312  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol, tertiary alcohol): Expected to be more negative than -1.16609312 but less extreme than polyols like **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** should be more negative than **CC(C)CO** (-1.16609312) but not as extreme as highly polar polyols. 
- A reasonable estimate would be around **-1.3 to -1.5**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is approximately **-1.4**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the trend of branching and alcohol functional groups in the given data.)

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -1.842431240737039
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and the presence of electronegative atoms (e.g., O, N, Cl, Br). The molecule in question is:

**O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**

This is a heterocyclic aromatic molecule with multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). The presence of multiple hydrogen-bonding donors (N-H) and acceptors (N and O) suggests significant polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions, which typically lowers the property value (as seen in similar molecules in the examples).

### Analysis of similar molecules in the dataset:
1. **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** has a property value of **-1.94848325**. This molecule also has a similar structure with multiple N-H and C=O groups, along with an electronegative fluorine atom.
2. **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** has a property value of **-2.04365637**, which is even lower due to the additional hydrogen-bonding groups.
3. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** has a value of **-1.2644136**, again due to multiple C=O and N-H groups.

The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** has:
- Two N-H groups (hydrogen bond donors),
- Multiple nitrogen atoms (hydrogen bond acceptors),
- A C=O group (hydrogen bond acceptor),
- Aromaticity (delocalized electrons).

Given these features, it is likely to have a **low (negative) property value**, similar to the examples above. 

### Predicted property value:
Based on the closest analogs (especially **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1**), the predicted value for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is approximately:

**-1.75** (interpolating between the two closest examples). 

This accounts for the slightly reduced polarity compared to **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (no additional F or extra N-H) but stronger than simpler aromatic systems. 

### Final answer:
**-1.75** (estimated based on structural similarity to provided examples).

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.2118665380248972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., alcohols like `CC(C)O` with -1.335, amides like `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` with -1.476) tend to have more negative property values.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons like `CCC(C)(C)C` with 0.070, halogens like `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` with 0.894) tend to have more positive values.
   - Esters (e.g., `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` with -0.092, `COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O` with -1.237) show intermediate to negative values depending on additional polar groups.

2. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is an ester with a polar carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) group but no strong hydrogen-bond donors.
   - Compared to similar molecules:
     - `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (phosphate ester, -0.092) is less polar than methyl acetate but has a similar ester-like fragment.
     - `COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O` (complex ester with additional polar groups, -1.237) is much more polar.
     - `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid ester, 1.711) is nonpolar due to the large hydrocarbon framework.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Methyl acetate is more polar than simple hydrocarbons but less polar than alcohols or amides. Its ester group suggests a value between -0.5 and 0.
   - From similar examples, a reasonable estimate is **-0.35 to -0.45**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **-0.42**. 

This aligns with the trend where esters with no additional strong polar groups have moderately negative values.

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.6784591571282119
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (N-aryl urea). The central urea group is **O=C(NR)NR'**, where R and R' are phenyl groups.
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Two benzene rings (phenyl groups) are present, which are moderately hydrophobic but not heavily substituted.
3. **Polarity**: The urea group is polar due to the C=O and N-H bonds, but the phenyl rings reduce overall polarity.
4. **Substituents**: No electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups are present on the phenyl rings (just plain benzene), so the electronic effects are neutral.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Neutral Urea/Carbamate-Like Structures**: 
  - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic urea) has a value of **-1.3422763**.
  - **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (cyclic urea with alkyl groups) has a value of **-1.25757153**.
- **Aromatic Amides/Anilines**:
  - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (aromatic carbamate) has a value of **-0.21713977**.
  - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (aromatic amide) has a value of **-1.47685971**.
- **Diaryl Ureas**: No exact examples, but the presence of two phenyl rings would likely reduce polarity compared to alkyl-substituted ureas, pushing the value closer to neutral or slightly negative.

### Key Observations:
1. The urea group is polar, but the two phenyl rings introduce hydrophobicity, balancing the polarity.
2. No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present, so the value should be moderate.
3. Compared to cyclic ureas (which are more polar due to constrained geometry), this diaryl urea is less polar but still more polar than simple aromatic hydrocarbons.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.75**  

This balances the polarity of the urea group with the hydrophobicity of the two phenyl rings.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.6286489245354994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of:
- Two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). 
- It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant aromaticity and planarity.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (property = 1.92070446): This is a larger, more conjugated PAH (likely a benzanthracene or similar). Its high value suggests extended conjugation increases the property.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 1.20625604): A diazo compound with two phenyl rings. Less conjugated than fluorene but still aromatic.
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene, not explicitly listed but implied in fragments): Smaller aromatic systems tend to have lower values.

2. **Fluorene-like Systems**:
   - Fluorene is less conjugated than the large PAH (1.92) but more conjugated than simple biphenyl or diazo compounds. Its central five-membered ring slightly disrupts full aromaticity compared to pure benzene rings.

3. **Other Clues**:
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (property = 2.48243799): Highly chlorinated biphenyl, where halogens increase the property.
   - **Sc1ccccc1** (property = -0.2488459): Thiophene-like, less aromatic than fluorene.

### Prediction:
Fluorene is more conjugated than simple benzene or biphenyl but less than larger PAHs. Given:
- Biphenyl-like structures (two fused rings) tend to have properties ~0.2â€“1.2.
- The central ring in fluorene adds some conjugation but not as much as a third fused benzene ring.

A reasonable estimate is **~1.0â€“1.3**. Splitting the difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.15** (rounded to two decimal places). 

This aligns with its intermediate conjugation between smaller aromatics and larger PAHs.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.983124621616702
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N)**: Highly polar and often associated with moderate property values (e.g., see molecules with sulfonamides or sulfonyl groups in the examples, which tend to have values around 0.5â€“1.0).
   - **Guanidine (NC(=N)N)**: Very polar and basic, likely to lower hydrophobicity (negative contribution).
   - **Aromatic amine (N attached to benzene)**: Moderately polar, similar to other aromatic amines in the dataset (e.g., **NNc1ccccc1** has a value of -0.935).

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - A benzene ring with substitutions (sulfonamide and amine) is common in the examples. Molecules with polar substitutions on aromatic rings tend to have property values in the range of -1.0 to +1.0, depending on the balance of polar/nonpolar groups.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (property = -1.210): Contains polar amide groups and an aromatic ring. The sulfonamide in our molecule is more polar than the amide here, but the guanidine adds even more polarity.
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = 0.522): Halogenated aromatic ring, less polar than our molecule but shows how substitutions affect the value.
   - **N(CC)CC, -0.083**: Aliphatic amines are less polar than guanidine/sulfonamide but still contribute to lowering the property.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity of the guanidine and sulfonamide groups, the property value is likely to be **negative** but not as extreme as molecules with multiple highly polar groups (e.g., **OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23** with -2.870). 

A reasonable estimate is **-1.0 to -0.5**. Considering the sulfonamide's counteracting effect (less negative than pure guanidine), the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.85**

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.084604130576485
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Highly polar functional groups**: Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), a trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`), and an amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`).
2. **Conjugation and electron-withdrawing effects**: The nitro and trifluoromethyl groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can influence the property.
3. **Size and branching**: The molecule is moderately large with branching (tertiary amine and unsaturated alkene `CC(C)=C`).

### Observations from the training data:
- Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) tend to decrease the property (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.71061686`).
- Trifluoromethyl groups (`C(F)(F)F`) are strongly electron-withdrawing and may increase the property (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a value of `0.47805508`).
- Tertiary amines (`CCN(CC)`) tend to increase the property (e.g., `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1` has a value of `0.13259922`).
- Aromatic systems with multiple substituents (especially electron-withdrawing ones) can lead to intermediate values.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two nitro groups (reducing effect),
- A trifluoromethyl group (increasing effect),
- A tertiary amine (increasing effect),
- Conjugation and branching,

the property is likely to be **moderately positive**, balancing the opposing contributions. 

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` with `0.47805508`), this molecule has more electron-withdrawing groups but also more branching. 

### Final predicted value:
**0.35** (approximate, based on qualitative trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.2118665380248972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (OH)**: Generally have negative property values (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O` = -0.267, `OC1CCCCCC1` = -0.436).
   - **Esters (COO)**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cccnc1` = -1.006, `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` = -0.611).
   - **Aldehydes (CHO)**: Negative values (e.g., `CCCC=O` = -0.926, `CC(C)CCOC=O` = -0.776).
   - **Ketones (C=O)**: Can be negative or slightly positive depending on other substituents (e.g., `CC(=O)N` = -1.948, `CCCCCCCC(=O)C` = 0.408).
   - **Ethers (COC)**: Often negative or near zero (e.g., `CCCCCCCCO` = 0.0001, `CCC(C)(C)O` = -0.802).

2. **Branching and Chain Length**:
   - Branching tends to reduce the property value (e.g., `CC(C)O` vs. linear alcohols).
   - Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O) often have more negative values.

3. **Specific Examples Similar to CC(C)OC=O**:
   - `CC(C)CCOC=O` (similar structure with an aldehyde and ether): Property = -0.775.
   - `CCCC=O` (linear aldehyde): Property = -0.926.
   - `CC(=O)N` (amide with C=O): Property = -1.948.

### Analysis of CC(C)OC=O:
- The molecule is an ester derivative with a branched alkyl group (`CC(C)O`) and an aldehyde (`C=O`). 
- The presence of the aldehyde (C=O) and ether (COC) suggests a negative property value, similar to `CC(C)CCOC=O` (-0.776) and `CCCC=O` (-0.926).
- The branching (`CC(C)`) may slightly increase the value compared to linear analogs (less negative).

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to `CC(C)CCOC=O` (-0.775) and the aldehyde trend, the predicted property for `CC(C)OC=O` is likely slightly more negative due to the direct attachment of the aldehyde to the ether oxygen (no spacer). 

**Predicted Property Value: -0.85** (approximate, based on trends). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is consistent with the observed trends for aldehydes and branched ethers.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.22576077398752026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with the structure:
- A benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (at positions 1 and 3, relative to the OH group).
  - A hydroxyl group (OH) at position 4 (para to one methyl and meta to the other).

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a value of **-0.64780671**.
   - `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` (a more complex polyphenol) has **-0.0844995**.
   - `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` (alkyl-substituted polyphenol) has **0.60319644**.
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl) tend to have higher (less negative) values than phenol itself.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - `Cc1ccccc1C` (dimethylbenzene-like) has **0.14944438**.
   - `CCc1ccccc1CC` (more alkyl substitution) has **0.32321915**.
   - Methyl groups increase the property value compared to unsubstituted benzene/phenol.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The target molecule has **two methyl groups and one OH group**. 
   - The OH group pulls the value down (more negative), while the methyl groups push it up (more positive).
   - The net effect is likely slightly higher than phenol but lower than a purely alkyl-substituted benzene.

### Prediction:
Given:
- Phenol: **-0.64780671**
- Dimethylbenzene-like: **~0.15 to 0.32**
- The target molecule has **both OH and two methyl groups**, so we expect a value between these, closer to phenol but shifted up by the methyl groups.

A reasonable estimate is **-0.35 to -0.45**. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (methyl-substituted aniline) has **-0.52121482**.
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2` (polar substituents) has **-0.44829209**.
- The target molecule is less polar than these but more polar than pure alkylbenzenes.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -0.42**  
*(This is an educated estimate based on the given examples and trends.)*

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.8716927545023044
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P(=S)) Group**: 
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)(OC)** group (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) have property values in the range **1.47â€“1.58**. This suggests that the **P(=S)** group contributes significantly to increasing the property value.

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - Substitutions on the aromatic ring (e.g., Cl, Br, I, SC) tend to increase the property value, especially when combined with the **P(=S)** group. For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of **0.89480525** (no P(=S), but multiple Cl substitutions).
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1.50792269** (P(=S) + Cl substitutions).

3. **Thioether (SC) Group**:
   - The **SC** group (thioether) is present in the target molecule. While no exact examples with **SC** are given, sulfur-containing groups (like **S(N)(=O)=O** in `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O`) tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **-1.65769549**). However, this is an outlier because the **S(N)(=O)=O** group is highly polar and negatively charged, unlike the neutral **SC** group.
   - The **SC** group is less polar than halogens (Cl, Br, I), so its effect is likely less pronounced than halogen substitutions.

4. **Methyl (C) Substitution**:
   - Methyl groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1O`) tend to slightly decrease the property value (e.g., **-0.43678374**).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The target molecule is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**. It has:
- A **P(=S)(OC)** group (like the examples with high property values ~1.47â€“1.58).
- A **SC** group on the aromatic ring (less polar than halogens, likely slightly reducing the effect of the P(=S) group).
- A **methyl (C)** group on the aromatic ring (slightly reducing the property value).

### Prediction:
Given the strong contribution of the **P(=S)** group (~1.5) and the moderating effects of the **SC** and **methyl** groups, the property value is likely slightly lower than the average for **P(=S)**-containing molecules but still significantly positive.

#### Final Prediction:
**1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity to high-value P(=S) examples with adjustments for SC and methyl groups). 

This is a rough estimate, but it aligns with the observed trends in the data. For a more precise prediction, statistical modeling or additional examples would be needed.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 2.9294985146834915
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine and bromine), aromaticity, and functional groups. Highly chlorinated aromatic systems tend to have higher property values, as seen in:

- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** â†’ **3.37655904**  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** â†’ **3.82361956**  

The molecule in question, **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with **6 chlorine atoms** and two fused aromatic rings. Comparing it to the examples:

1. It has fewer chlorines than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (8 Cl) but more than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (6 Cl).  
2. Its structure is less symmetric than the latter but similarly chlorinated.  

Given the trend, the property value should lie between **3.37655904** (6 Cl) and **3.82361956** (8 Cl). Since it has 6 Cl but slightly less steric crowding, a reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: ~3.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an interpolation based on the clear trend of increasing values with higher chlorine count and aromaticity.)

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.1398195944532952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have negative property values unless they are part of a larger, more complex or halogenated system.
   - Example: 
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene-like) has a value of **-0.63480678**.
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dinitrile) has **-0.62197107**, but this is not directly comparable.
     - `Nc1ccccc1O` (nitrophenol-like) has **-0.93366818**.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`) have negative values (e.g., `CCC` has **-0.63131733**).
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC`) have positive values (**0.97013638**), but this is likely due to increased hydrophobicity/size.

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is a nitroalkane (specifically, nitropropane). 
   - Nitro groups are highly polar and electronegative, which typically lowers the property value (as seen in other nitro-containing molecules).
   - The presence of a short alkyl chain (propyl) may slightly offset the negative effect, but not enough to make the value positive.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(=C)C` (isobutene-like) has **-0.51767063**.
   - `CC` (ethane) has **-0.89822628**.
   - `CCC` (propane) has **-0.63131733**.
   - Adding a nitro group to `CCC` (giving `CCCN(=O)=O`) would likely make the value more negative than `CCC` but less negative than very polar nitroaromatics (e.g., **-0.63480678** for the trinitro example).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitro groups strongly reduce the property value.
- The propyl chain is short and not enough to counteract the nitro group's effect.
- Similar nitro-containing molecules have values around **-0.6 to -0.9**.

A reasonable estimate for `CCCN(=O)=O` is **-0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (approximate predicted value).
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.17050425772120847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends based on molecular features such as substituents, halogens, and aromatic systems. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of **0.52239166**. This is a benzene ring with Cl and Br substituents (meta to each other).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (highly chlorinated biphenyl) has a very high value of **2.48243799**, suggesting multiple halogens increase the property.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** (brominated methane) has a low value of **0.07916269**, indicating that aliphatic halogens contribute less than aromatic halogens.

2. **Fluorine Substitution**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has a value of **-0.37966618**, but this also includes an amide group, which may lower the value.
   - Fluorine is less polarizable than Cl/Br, so its contribution may be smaller.

3. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **0.52239166**, and **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12** (naphthalene with Br) has **0.86435806**, suggesting Br on aromatics increases the property.

4. **Combined Halogens**:
   - When Cl and Br are both present on an aromatic ring (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**), the value is moderately high (~0.52). 

### Prediction for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**:
- This is a benzene ring with F and Br substituents (likely para to each other, given the SMILES notation). 
- Fluorine is less electron-withdrawing and polarizable than Cl/Br, so its contribution will be smaller than Cl in **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**.
- Bromine's contribution is significant, but F is weaker than Cl, so the value should be lower than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (0.52239166) but higher than purely aliphatic halogen examples.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but still positive due to the aromatic Br. 

**Predicted property value: 0.45** (approximate, likely between 0.4 and 0.5). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that the property increases with aromatic halogen substitution and polarizability.)

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.09955204453625945
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system (decalin-like) with a hydroxyl group (`C(O)`). It has two tertiary carbons (`C1(C)` and `C2(C)`), indicating steric bulk.
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Hydroxyl group (`C(O)`), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - No highly electronegative atoms (e.g., halogens) or strongly electron-withdrawing groups.
3. **Size and Complexity**: 
   - Medium-sized (10 carbons, 1 oxygen), similar to some steroids or terpenes in the examples (e.g., `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO` with property `0.05459968`).
   - Less polar than halogenated or nitro-containing molecules but more polar than simple alkanes.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Similar to aliphatic alcohols/steroids**: 
  - `CC(C)(C)CO` (tert-butanol derivative) has a property of `-0.89918417`.
  - `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO` (steroid-like) has `0.05459968`.
- **Less polar than halogenated aromatics** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with `3.37655904`).
- **More polar than simple ethers/alcohols** (e.g., `CCCOCCC` with `-0.35305055`).

### Prediction:
Given the hydroxyl group and bicyclic structure, the molecule is moderately polar but lacks strong electron-withdrawing/donating effects. Its property value likely falls between simple alcohols (`~-0.9`) and steroid-like molecules (`~0.05`). 

A reasonable estimate is slightly negative but closer to zero due to the steric bulk and hydroxyl group:  
**Predicted property value: `-0.35`**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.1649621851387777
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 1.05313063). The presence of P(=S) often contributes to higher property values, as seen here.
2. **Aromatic system (c1ccccc1)**: This is a benzene ring, common in many of the examples, and its contribution depends on substitution. Here, it's part of a fused lactam system (N2C(=O)...C2=O), similar to the structure in the example above.
3. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a phthalimide-like moiety, which is polar and can influence the property value. In the example with P(=S) and a similar lactam, the value was ~1.05.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest match is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 1.05313063). The only difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**. The lactam here is slightly more polar but structurally similar in bulkiness and aromaticity.
- The phosphorus group and aromaticity likely dominate the property value, keeping it in a similar range (~1.0â€“1.3).

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities, the property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely slightly lower than 1.05313063 due to the absence of the thioether (S) group, but still in the same ballpark. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.95** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, refractive index, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core (two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring with a carbonyl group, resembling a fused heterocycle). This is somewhat similar to the structure **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (property = -1.12114076), but with an aromatic substitution pattern.
2. **Aromatic Substitution**: It has a phenyl ring attached to one nitrogen and a methyl group on the other nitrogen, along with a carbonyl group. This is reminiscent of **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = 0.08545739), which also has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl.
3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalization**: The carbonyl group and the nitrogen atoms create electron delocalization, which may lower the property value (as seen in other carbonyl-containing examples like **CC(=O)C** with -0.92614191).
4. **Methyl Groups**: The two methyl groups add slight hydrophobicity, which could slightly increase the property (similar to **Cc1ccccc1C**, which has a property of 0.18669258).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = 0.6719592): This has a fused aromatic system with a nitrogen, but no carbonyl. The carbonyl in our molecule would likely reduce the property compared to this.
- **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = 0.08545739): This is structurally closer, with a carbonyl and fused aromatic rings. Our molecule has an additional methyl group and a slightly different heterocycle, which might push the property slightly higher.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing carbonyl (reducing the property) and the aromatic/hydrophobic contributions (increasing it), the property should be **moderately positive but lower than purely aromatic systems**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.25** (with uncertainty around Â±0.15 based on similar examples).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.25**

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.14313599805488286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCCC**, property = -0.09749943) have values close to zero or slightly negative.
   - Longer or branched chains (e.g., **CCC(C)C**, **CCCCCCCI**) tend to have slightly higher values but still near zero unless functionalized.

2. **Ester Groups (-COO-)**: 
   - Esters generally have moderately negative values unless combined with large hydrophobic/aromatic systems.
   - Example: **CC(=O)OC3CCC4...** (a steroid ester) has a value of 1.4443599, but this is influenced by the large hydrophobic core.
   - Simpler esters like **CCOC(=O)N** (-1.5308436) or **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (-0.94495759) are more negative.

3. **Polar vs. Nonpolar Balance**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -COO, -Cl) tend to have more negative values unless heavily halogenated or aromatic.
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** has a polar ester group but a medium-length hydrocarbon chain (6 carbons + ethyl group), balancing polarity and hydrophobicity.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate) has a value of 0.39068191, but it has a longer chain (9 carbons).
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a value of -0.94495759, but itâ€™s smaller and more polar.

### Prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- The hexanoate (6-carbon chain) with an ethyl ester is less polar than methyl esters but not as hydrophobic as longer chains. 
- The ester group will pull the value negative, but the hydrocarbon chain will offset this slightly.
- Expected range: Between -0.5 and 0.0, likely closer to -0.3 to -0.4.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.35** (estimated based on the balance of polarity and chain length). 

This is a rough interpolation from the examples, as no exact match is provided. The actual value would likely fall in this range.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5923859804776176
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule is an ester (methyl benzoate) with a benzene ring and a carboxylate group (COO-). This is similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), which has a property value of **-0.52690742**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-0.32547703**.

2. **Key Differences**:
   - The presence of an **ethoxy group (CCO-)** in ethyl benzoate vs. a **methoxy group (CO-)** in methyl benzoate. The shorter alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl) typically reduces hydrophobicity slightly, which may lead to a marginally lower (more negative) value.
   - No substituents like -OH (as in the first example) are present, so the value should be closer to ethyl benzoate.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.32547703**.
   - For **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)**, I expect a slightly more negative value due to the shorter alkyl chain. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.35 and -0.40**.

4. **Final Estimate**:  
   Given the trends, I predict the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** to be:  
   **-0.36** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the provided data).

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.36** (approximate, based on structural analogy).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value aligns with the trend of simpler aromatic esters in the dataset.)

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.4040239333241318
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. 

The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), a simple linear conjugated diene with no heteroatoms, halogens, or aromatic rings. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CC/C=C/C** (2-pentene) has a property value of **-0.25076168**. This is a simple alkene with no conjugation or additional functional groups.
2. **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a value of **-0.00643154**, slightly higher due to the aromatic ring.
3. **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **0.20533037**, reflecting the influence of the aromatic ring and alkyl chain.

**1,3-Butadiene (C=CCC=C)** has conjugated double bonds, which introduce some electron delocalization but lack the stabilizing effect of an aromatic ring or polar substituents. Its property value should thus be:
- Slightly higher than **CC/C=C/C** due to conjugation.
- Lower than **C=Cc1ccccc1** or **CCCc1ccccc1** due to the absence of an aromatic ring.

### Predicted property value for **C=CCC=C**:  
**Approximately -0.15 to 0.10**.  

A reasonable estimate based on the trend is:  
**Predicted value: -0.12**.  

This places it between the simple alkene and aromatic-containing examples, reflecting its intermediate electronic structure.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0791626910848464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a very high value (**3.82361956**), suggesting that heavy halogenation (especially with Cl) increases the property value significantly.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a moderately high value (**0.86435806**).
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of **0.78971113**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl derivative) has a value of **2.92949851**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a mixed halogen compound) has a value of **0.115973**.

   Halogenation generally increases the property value, with heavier halogens (Br, Cl) contributing more than lighter ones (F). Multiple halogens on a single carbon (e.g., CCl3, CBr3) seem to amplify this effect.

2. **Simple Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichloromethyl group attached to a phosphate ester) has a value of **-0.12185718**, but this is influenced by the polar phosphate group.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (mixed halogen compound) has a value of **0.115973**, suggesting that even simple polyhalogenated alkanes can have positive values.

3. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated**:
   - Bromine appears to contribute more to the property value than chlorine when comparing similar structures (e.g., bromonaphthalene vs. chloronaphthalene).

4. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a simple polyhalogenated alkane with three bromines on a single carbon. Given that:
     - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (mixed halogens) has a value of **0.115973**.
     - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.86435806**.
     - Tribromomethane is more heavily brominated than these examples but lacks aromaticity or extended conjugation.
   - The property value is likely higher than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but lower than heavily halogenated aromatic systems like hexachlorobenzene.

### Prediction:
For **BrC(Br)Br**, the property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.0**, considering:
- The strong contribution from three bromines.
- The lack of aromaticity or other structural features that could further increase the value.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**, interpolating between the mixed halogen compound (**0.115973**) and bromonaphthalene (**0.86435806**).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 0.75** (approximate).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.0531306319602105
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate-like group (P(=S))**: The presence of a thiophosphate group (P(=S)) is seen in the example **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a property value of **1.36355512**. This suggests that the P(=S) group contributes positively to the property value.

2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is common in many examples. For instance, **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** has a value of **0.29372985**, while **N#Cc1ccccc1** has **-0.53417369**. The presence of substituents affects the value.

3. **Lactam-like structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This resembles a fused aromatic lactam (e.g., phthalimide-like). The example **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** has a value of **0.52157061**, which is somewhat similar.

4. **Chlorine substituent (C(CCl))**: Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value, as seen in **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.34186577)** and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl (2.92949851)**.

5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as halogens or aromatic systems.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines a **thiophosphate group (P(=S))** with an **aromatic lactam** and a **chlorine substituent**. 
- The closest examples are:
  - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (1.36355512)** (due to P(=S) and Cl).
  - **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (0.52157061)** (due to aromatic lactam and Cl).
  - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl (2.92949851)** (due to multiple Cl atoms).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- P(=S) group (~contribution ~1.0-1.5),
- Aromatic lactam (~0.5),
- Single chlorine substituent (~0.5-1.0),
- Ethoxy groups (~neutral to slight negative effect),

The property value is likely in the range of **1.0 to 1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is **1.25**, considering the balance of these features. 

However, looking at the closest example with P(=S) and Cl (**1.36355512**), and accounting for the additional aromatic lactam (which may slightly reduce the value compared to a purely Cl-dominated system), the predicted value is:

### Predicted Property Value: **1.20** (approximate, likely between 1.1 and 1.3). 

For precision, I would estimate **1.20** as the final answer.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3632452264213069
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Present in the molecule (CN(C)C(=O)N...). Examples with amides (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)C` = -1.53570147, `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` = -1.44326517) suggest amides contribute to negative property values.
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**: Attached to the aromatic ring. Cl-substituted aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` = 1.58831695) can increase the value, but when combined with electron-withdrawing groups, the effect may be muted or negative.
   - **Heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O))**: A fused oxadiazole-like ring with a carbonyl (=O). Similar heterocycles (e.g., `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` = -0.0592386) tend to have modest or slightly negative contributions.
   - **Tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)**: Bulky hydrophobic group. Alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` = 2.83849905) increase the value, but here it's balanced by polar groups.

2. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalization**:
   - The amide and oxadiazole carbonyl are electron-withdrawing, likely reducing the property value.
   - The Cl on the aromatic ring may slightly offset this, but the net effect is still negative.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` = -1.44326517 (similar amide + alkyl).
   - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` = -0.68208545 (amide-like + aromatic).
   - `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` = -0.79504794 (aromatic + nitro, similar to Cl in electronegativity).

### Prediction:
The molecule has a mix of negative contributors (amide, oxadiazole) and modest positive contributors (Cl, tert-butyl). The amide dominance suggests a value closer to -1.0, but the Cl and bulky group may pull it slightly higher. 

**Predicted Property Value: -0.85**  
*(Estimated range: -0.9 to -0.7, likely near the middle)*. 

This aligns with the trend where amides and polar heterocycles reduce the value, while Cl and alkyl groups partially counteract the effect.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1.9196781536452436
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -CO, -CN, -NO2)**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, ethers, carbonyls) tend to have more negative property values. For example:
     - **OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O** has many -OH and ether groups and a very negative value (-3.726).
     - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** has multiple -OH groups and a value of -3.178.
   - Less polar or nonpolar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halogens without polar groups) tend to have positive or less negative values.

2. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I, F)**:
   - Halogens alone (without polar groups) often increase the property value. For example:
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** has multiple Cl atoms and a high value (1.588).
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has multiple Cl atoms and a value of 1.140.
   - When halogens are combined with polar groups (e.g., -OH), the effect is less pronounced or negative.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromaticity alone does not strongly correlate with negativity unless paired with polar groups. For example:
     - **c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2** has two aromatic rings and Cl, giving a high value (1.141).
     - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has an aromatic ring with -NH2 and Cl, giving a negative value (-0.285).

4. **Symmetry and Multiplicity**:
   - Molecules with repeated polar or nonpolar motifs (e.g., two aromatic rings with Cl) tend to amplify the trend. For example:
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (two aromatic rings with Cl) has a high value (1.588).
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (multiple Cl and -OH) has a high value (1.140).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**:
- It has **two aromatic rings**, each substituted with **Cl** and linked by an **ether (-O-)**.
- Each ring has **one -OH** and **one or two Cl** atoms.
- This is similar to **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (value = 1.588) but with added -OH groups and an ether link.

### Effect of Substituents:
- The **Cl atoms** will push the value upward (as seen in other examples).
- The **-OH groups and ether link** will push the value downward (but not as strongly as multiple -OH groups would).
- The net effect is likely a **moderately high positive value**, but less than **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** due to the polar -OH and -O-.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (1.140): Multiple Cl and one -OH.
2. **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (1.588): Two aromatic rings with Cl, no polar groups.
3. **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.246): One aromatic ring with -OH and Cl.

The target molecule has **two aromatic rings with Cl and -OH**, so its value should be between **0.246 and 1.588**, likely closer to **1.140** but slightly lower due to the additional -OH and ether.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is approximately **0.95**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.95**

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.25076167919270853
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as size, polarity, functional groups, and halogenation. The molecule in question is **CC/C=C\C**, which is a simple alkene (2-pentene, specifically the trans isomer due to the \ notation). 

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (a similar alkene, likely the cis isomer) has a property value of **-0.25076168**.
- **CCCC(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **0.07081537**.
- **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC** (a long alkane) has a very high value (**5.50758858**) due to its size.

Since **CC/C=C\C** is a small, nonpolar alkene (similar to **CC/C=C/C** but trans), its value should be close to the cis isomer but slightly less negative (trans alkenes are typically less polar than cis). 

**Predicted property value: -0.20** (approximate, likely between -0.15 and -0.25). 

For precision, given the similarity to **CC/C=C/C (-0.25076168)**, I'd estimate:  
**Predicted value: -0.23**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is based on structural trends in the data. The property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the prediction follows the pattern.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.6199595020914406
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C** (methane): -1.165  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -1.163  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.896  
   These suggest that small hydrocarbons tend to have negative values, with slight increases as chain length grows.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -1.336  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): -0.802  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.642  
   Oxygenated compounds (alcohols, ethers) tend to have negative values, with more oxygen atoms or branching lowering the value further.

3. **Ethers**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate): -0.776  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -0.325  
   Ethers/esters show moderately negative values, with aromaticity increasing the value.

4. **Chain Length and Symmetry**:
   - **CCCOCC** is a symmetric ether (diethyl ether) with no branching or aromaticity. It is structurally simpler than most ethers in the examples but similar to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, -0.802) in chain length.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- Diethyl ether is less polar than alcohols (no OH group), so its value should be less negative than **CCC(O)CC** (-0.802).  
- It is more polar than pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CCCCCC1**: 0.268), so its value should be below zero.  
- Comparing to **CCOC(=O)C** (-0.776), diethyl ether lacks a carbonyl group, so its value should be slightly higher (less negative).  

### Estimated Value:
Given these trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOCC** is:  
**-0.55**  

This balances the influence of the ether oxygen (reducing the value) with the lack of highly polar or aromatic features (preventing it from being as negative as alcohols or as positive as aromatic systems).  

**Final Answer:**  
**-0.55**
==================================================
Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.9775258146319861
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which contribute hydrophobicity and aromatic stacking interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.775): This is a simple biphenyl derivative with no polar groups. The predicted molecule has additional polar amide functionality, which would likely reduce the property value compared to this purely hydrophobic example.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 0.684): This has a similar tertiary amide and phenyl rings but with an additional heterocyclic polar group. The predicted molecule lacks the heterocycle but has a bulky tert-butyl-like group, which may balance the polarity somewhat.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = 0.057): This is a less hydrophobic molecule with an amine group. The predicted molecule is more hydrophobic but has a polar amide.

3. **Polarity vs. Hydrophobicity Trade-off**:
   - The amide group introduces polarity (tending to lower the property value), while the two phenyl rings and bulky tert-butyl-like group increase hydrophobicity (tending to raise the property value).
   - The balance suggests a property value in the low-to-mid positive range, likely less than the purely hydrophobic biphenyl (0.775) but higher than the polar amide-containing examples.

4. **Steric Effects**:
   - The bulky **C(C)(C)c1ccccc1** group may slightly reduce the property value compared to simpler hydrophobic groups due to reduced packing efficiency.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above analysis, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than the **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** example (0.684) due to the absence of the heterocycle but higher than **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (0.057) due to greater hydrophobicity. 

**Predicted property value: 0.45** (specific estimate: 0.45 Â± 0.1). 

This reflects the combined effects of the polar amide and the hydrophobic aromatic/bulky groups.

True Property: 0.046868144678582115
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a phenyl ring (`c1ccc(Br)cc1`) substituted with a bromine atom (`Br`) and an acetamido group (`CC(=O)N-`). 
   - The phenyl ring with a bromine substituent is present in some of the examples (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` with a value of **0.17050426**, and `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` with a value of **-0.12609926**).
   - The acetamido group (`CC(=O)N-`) is a polar and electron-withdrawing substituent, similar to other amide or carbonyl-containing groups in the examples (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` with **0.97752581**, but this is more complex).

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - The bromine atom is moderately electron-withdrawing (inductive effect) but can donate electrons through resonance (less than groups like `-OCH3`).
   - The acetamido group (`CC(=O)N-`) is electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl but can also donate electrons through resonance (amide resonance).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of **-0.12609926**. Here, the `-OH` group is strongly electron-donating (resonance) and polar, leading to a slightly negative value.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` has a value of **-0.52121482**, where the `-NH2` group is strongly electron-donating (resonance), leading to a more negative value.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of **0.38842403**, where the amide group is part of a larger, less polarizable system.

### Prediction:
The acetamido group (`CC(=O)N-`) is less electron-donating than `-NH2` but more polar than a simple alkyl group. The bromine substituent adds some electron-withdrawing character but not as strongly as nitro (`-NO2`) or carbonyl groups. 

Given these observations, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely slightly negative but less so than molecules with strongly donating groups (like `-OH` or `-NH2`). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (between `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` at **-0.126** and `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` at **-0.521**).

### Final Answer:
Predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**: **-0.35**.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.37364516509451073
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Property value = **-0.52121482**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethylbenzene or xylene): Property value = **0.14944438**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (cumene or isopropylbenzene): Property value = **0.53328422**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (pyrene, polyaromatic): Property value = **1.92070446**

   The property tends to increase with larger/branched alkyl groups attached to the aromatic ring. For example:
   - Methyl (toluene): ~ -0.52
   - Ethyl/xylene: ~ +0.15
   - Isopropyl (cumene): ~ +0.53

2. **Branched vs. Linear Alkyl Groups**:
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl, isobutyl) seem to increase the property value more than linear alkyl groups (e.g., ethyl).
   - Example: **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropylbenzene) has a higher value (+0.53) than **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethylbenzene, +0.15).

3. **Isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1)**:
   - This has an isobutyl group (branched 4-carbon chain) attached to benzene.
   - Compared to isopropylbenzene (cumene, +0.53), the isobutyl group is slightly larger but similarly branched. We might expect a modest increase in the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- Methyl: -0.52
- Ethyl: +0.15
- Isopropyl: +0.53
- Isobutyl should likely be slightly higher than isopropyl but not drastically so (since branching is similar).

A reasonable estimate would be **~0.6 to ~0.7**. Looking at the examples, **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine) has a value of **0.74660612**, which is somewhat similar in bulkiness but not identical. 

Given the consistency of the trend, I predict the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** to be approximately:

**Predicted property value: 0.65** (specific estimate: **0.6532**)  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and trends. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled.)*

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5746650323436718
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functional Group Analysis**: The molecule has an aldehyde group (**O=C**) attached to a benzene ring. This is similar to:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property: -1.26434518), which has an amide and a hydroxyl group.
   - **COc1ccccc1** (property: -0.44049214), which has a methoxy group.
   - **c1cncnc1** (property: -1.27426617), which is a heterocycle but shares some aromatic character.

   The aldehyde group is more polar than a methoxy group but less polar than an amide + hydroxyl combination.

2. **Aromatic Ring Contribution**: The benzene ring alone (without substituents) is not in the dataset, but substituted benzenes with moderately polar groups tend to have property values in the range of -0.5 to -1.5.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): -0.44049214
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + hydroxyl): -1.26434518
   - **c1cncnc1** (heterocycle): -1.27426617

   The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is more electron-withdrawing than a methoxy group but less polar than an amide + hydroxyl combination. Thus, its property value should be between these two extremes, likely closer to the more polar examples.

4. **Prediction**: Given the above, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is likely around **-1.0 to -1.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

   **Predicted property value: -1.15** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

This aligns with the observed trend that more polar/electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings tend to decrease the property value.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.5500698068515157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the aromatic ring (similar to the first example: `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, which has a high value of **1.61123787**). Nitro groups often increase the property value when attached to aromatic systems.
2. **Heterocyclic core with two amide (C=O) groups**: The central structure is a 5-membered ring with two amide-like carbonyls (similar to some polar, conjugated systems in the examples, but not directly matched).
3. **Aromatic system with an oxygen (o1)**: The presence of an oxygen in the aromatic ring (likely a furan-like moiety) may contribute to polarity and conjugation.
4. **Overall polarity and conjugation**: The molecule is highly conjugated and polar, which tends to correlate with higher property values in the examples (e.g., nitroaromatics and fused ring systems).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The first example (`Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) has a nitro group and aromatic rings, yielding **1.61123787**.
- Other nitro-containing or highly conjugated systems (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) have values around **0.97752581**.
- The given molecule has more polar/charged character due to the amide groups and nitro, but the central heterocycle may slightly reduce the value compared to purely aromatic nitro systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong contribution from the nitro group and the polar heterocycle, but slightly less than the first example due to the non-aromatic core, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **1.2 to 1.4**. 

A precise prediction based on the trends is:  
**1.31245678**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For exact values, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.5381968263382932
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.73223779**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene derivative) has a property value of **1.20625604**.
   - The presence of **N=N** (azo group) between two phenyl rings increases the property value significantly compared to a single **NH** group.

2. **Nitrogen-Linked Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative, where a nitrogen atom is linked to two phenyl rings (no double bonds like in the azo case).
   - This structure is similar to **Nc1ccccc1** but with an additional phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen instead of hydrogen.

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The property value for **Nc1ccccc1** is **-0.73223779**.
   - Adding a second phenyl ring (as in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) would likely increase the property value, but not as much as the **N=N** linkage in the azo compound (which has a value of **1.20625604**).
   - The nitrogen in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less electron-withdrawing than the **N=N** group, so the property value should be higher than **-0.73223779** but lower than **1.20625604**.

4. **Estimated Value**:
   - A reasonable estimate for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** would be slightly positive, reflecting the addition of the second phenyl ring but without the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the azo group.
   - A plausible prediction is **~0.5**, based on interpolation between the aniline and azo compound values.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **0.48**. 

This is based on the structural similarity to the given examples and the observed trend that adding aromatic rings with nitrogen linkages increases the property value, but not as dramatically as conjugated systems like azo groups.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1.6600217900609788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: a cyclohexane and a diketopiperazine (formed by the two amides).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two polar amide groups suggests moderate polarity, but the cyclohexane ring adds hydrophobicity.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is medium-sized (12 heavy atoms) and rigid due to the fused rings.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Similar to diketopiperazines or cyclic amides**: 
  - Example: **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -1.3422763) is a similar diketopiperazine derivative with substituents. Our molecule is simpler but shares the same core.
  - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.78957429) is another cyclic amide with alkyl substituents.
- **Rigid vs. flexible**: Our molecule is rigid (fused rings), which may increase the property value slightly compared to flexible chains.
- **No strongly polar/nitro groups**: Unlike molecules with **NO2** or **CF3** (which increase the property), our molecule lacks such groups.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value likely falls between **-1.0** and **-0.5**, closer to the simpler cyclic amides. The rigidity might push it toward the higher end of this range.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.85**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or bioactivityâ€”this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

True Property: 2.0353774713846344
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Structure**: The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** derivative with three chlorine atoms (two on one ring, one on the other). It is a symmetric, hydrophobic, and highly halogenated aromatic system.
2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.44774473**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl with 5 Cl atoms) has a property value of **2.84390428**.
3. **Trend**: 
   - Adding more chlorine atoms to aromatic systems tends to **increase the property value** (e.g., dichlorobenzene â†’ pentachlorinated biphenyl shows a large jump).
   - The given molecule has **3 chlorine atoms**, which is intermediate between these two examples.

### Prediction:
- The molecule is less chlorinated than the pentachlorinated biphenyl but more chlorinated than dichlorobenzene. 
- The property value should lie between **0.44774473** (dichlorobenzene) and **2.84390428** (pentachlorinated biphenyl).
- Given the symmetry and moderate chlorination, a reasonable estimate is around **1.5â€“2.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**1.876** (approximate, based on interpolation of the trend).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.32321914665930546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics)**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = **1.00605723**
   - **CCCCCC=C** (1-octene): Property = **0.81687413**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (tetradecanol): Property = **1.60159056**
   - **C=CC=O** (acrolein): Property = **-1.34631311** (note: this has a polar carbonyl group, which lowers the property value significantly).

   Hydrocarbons with long alkyl chains or aromatic rings tend to have **positive property values**, while polar or functionalized molecules have **lower or negative values**.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): Property = **-0.52121482** (due to the polar -NH2 group).
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): Property = **-0.57466503** (due to the polar carbonyl group).
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): Property = **-0.47552351** (due to the polar nitrogen in the ring).

   Pure aromatic hydrocarbons without polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**) have **higher positive values**, while polar substituents reduce the property value.

3. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a purely hydrocarbon aromatic molecule with two ethyl groups (no polar functional groups).
   - Similar to **hexylbenzene (CCCCCCc1ccccc1)**, but with shorter alkyl chains (ethyl instead of hexyl).
   - Shorter alkyl chains would likely reduce the property value slightly compared to hexylbenzene.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Hexylbenzene has a property value of **1.00605723**,
- Diethylbenzene has smaller alkyl groups (less hydrophobic contribution), but is still a pure hydrocarbon,

I estimate the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** to be **slightly lower than hexylbenzene but still positive**, likely in the range of **0.7 to 0.9**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, refractive index, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -1.657695487989341
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Nitro groups (NOâ‚‚)**: Often associated with positive property values (e.g., `1.30943438` for `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(C)C)N(=O)=O`).
   - **Sulfonamides (S(=O)(=O)N)**: Similar to nitro groups, these are polar and electron-withdrawing, often leading to positive property values.
   - **Amino groups (NHâ‚‚)**: Tend to lower the property value (e.g., `-1.64476399` for `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Neutral or slightly positive/negative depending on substituents.
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)**: Can increase the property value (e.g., `0.59703858` for `Brc1cccc(Br)c1`).

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a property value of `-0.79504794`. This is an aromatic ring with an amino group and a nitro group. The nitro group increases the value, but the amino group pulls it down.
   - `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` has a very low value (`-2.54114291`) due to multiple polar groups (amino, hydroxyl, and heterocyclic nitrogens).
   - `Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of `0.49276552`, showing that aromaticity with polar substituents can lead to moderate positive values.

3. **Target Molecule: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**:
   - This is an aromatic ring with:
     - An **amino group (NHâ‚‚)** at position 1 (electron-donating, tends to decrease the property value).
     - A **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)** at position 4 (electron-withdrawing, tends to increase the property value).
   - The sulfonamide is similar in effect to a nitro group but slightly less electron-withdrawing. The amino group counteracts this.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the amino group (decreasing) and sulfonamide (increasing), the property value will likely be slightly negative or near zero. Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.79504794` (nitro instead of sulfonamide).
- Sulfonamides are less electron-withdrawing than nitro groups, so the value should be less negative than `-0.79504794`.

A reasonable estimate is **`-0.5` to `-0.3`**. 

Looking at other sulfonamide-like examples (none are exact matches), the closest is `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` with `0.31495393`, but this has additional complexity. 

Given the balance of effects, the predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is approximately:

**`-0.45`**

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (estimated based on structural similarity and functional group contributions).

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 1.469812385380017
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, we can deduce the following:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromaticity and Ring Systems**: 
   - Molecules with multiple fused aromatic rings (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** â†’ 2.13172743
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** â†’ 2.25883931
     - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** â†’ 1.3427005
   - The property value increases with the number of fused rings and conjugation.

2. **Substituents**:
   - Electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, Br) increase the property value, especially when multiple are present (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** â†’ 4.27068008).
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., -OH, -OCH3) or polar groups tend to decrease the property value or have a neutral effect.

3. **Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule is **phenanthrene** (a PAH with 3 fused benzene rings, structure: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34).
   - It has no substituents, so its property value will depend purely on its aromatic ring system.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (2.13172743): A 4-ring PAH with a methyl group.
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (2.25883931): A 5-ring PAH (picene-like structure).
- **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (1.3427005): A 3-ring PAH (methyl-substituted fluorene).

Phenanthrene (target) is a 3-ring PAH with no substituents, so its value should be:
- Lower than the 4- and 5-ring PAHs (which have values > 2).
- Slightly lower than the methyl-substituted 3-ring PAH (1.3427005) because substituents (even simple ones like -CH3) seem to increase the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted value for **phenanthrene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34)** is approximately **1.2**.

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at:
- **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (3-ring + methyl) â†’ 1.3427005  
- **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (4-ring + methyl) â†’ 2.13172743  
- The unsubstituted 3-ring PAH should be slightly lower than 1.3427005.  

A reasonable prediction is **1.15 to 1.25**. Averaging similar systems, I predict:  
**1.20**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is **1.20**.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.08449950171978021
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This molecule features:
- Multiple hydroxyl groups (â€“OH), which are highly polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
- A carbonyl group (C=O), which adds polarity.
- An aromatic system with extended conjugation, which can increase molecular size and complexity.
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, which generally contribute to higher polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) have very negative values (-3.80446178), indicating strong contributions from polarity/hydrogen bonding.
- Molecules with aromatic systems and moderate polarity (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1`) have values around -0.8492371.
- The presence of a carbonyl group and additional aromatic rings (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`) gives a positive value (1.18271934).

This molecule has **four hydroxyl groups**, a **carbonyl group**, and **two aromatic rings**, which suggests a balance between highly polar groups and extended conjugation. Comparing to the examples, this likely places it in the **moderately positive range**.

### Predicted property value: **1.25** (approximate, based on similar molecules in the dataset). 

A more precise estimate might place it between **1.1 and 1.4**, given the combined effects of the polar groups and aromaticity. For this specific case, I predict:  
**1.32**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.7519429343322958
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphorus groups (especially with multiple electronegative substituents like Cl or O) tend to have **higher positive property values**.
   - Example: `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1.50792269** (high due to P=S and multiple Cl atoms).
   - Example: `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **2.23222368** (very high due to P=O and multiple Cl atoms).

2. **Polar functional groups (e.g., esters, amides, nitro groups)**:
   - Esters (`COO`) and amides (`CON`) often contribute moderately positive or negative values depending on the rest of the structure.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has a value of **1.04471489** (due to multiple polar groups).

3. **Halogens (Cl, Br)**:
   - Presence of halogens (especially multiple Cl atoms) increases the property value significantly.
   - Example: `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` has a value of **1.55944344** (many Cl atoms).

4. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes)**:
   - These tend to have **low or negative values**.
   - Example: `CCCCC` has a value of **-0.09749943**.

5. **Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyrimidines, imidazoles)**:
   - Often have **strongly negative values**.
   - Example: `NC(N)=NC#N` has a value of **-2.46185706**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- **Phosphorus group**: `P(=O)` is present, which is a strong contributor to higher values (similar to the examples with P=O or P=S).
- **Amide group**: `NC(C)=O` is polar and may contribute moderately.
- **Thioether group**: `SC` is less polar than oxygen but still contributes.
- **No halogens**: Unlike the highest examples, this lacks Cl/Br, so the value won't be as extreme.
- **Overall**: The molecule has a mix of P=O (strong positive contributor) and polar groups (amide, thioether), but no halogens or aromatic systems with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.50792269): Higher due to P=S and multiple Cl atoms.
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (2.23222368): Very high due to P=O and multiple Cl atoms.
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (1.27214513): P=S and polar groups but no halogens.

Our molecule is most similar to the last example but with P=O (slightly stronger than P=S) and fewer bulky substituents. However, it lacks the long hydrocarbon tail, so the value may be slightly lower.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is approximately **1.1**.

### Final Answer:
**1.1**
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.2762825813315571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a high value of **3.37655904**, likely due to multiple chlorines and aromaticity.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a value of **0.24631434**, indicating that fewer chlorines and a polar group (OH) reduce the value.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a value of **-0.28517727**, showing that an electron-donating group (NH2) further reduces the value.

2. **Alkenes and Simple Halogenated Aliphatics**:
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a value of **-0.64164885**, suggesting that a single halogen on a small aliphatic chain gives a negative value.
   - **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane) has a value of **-0.10783094**, indicating that longer chains slightly increase the value.
   - **CCC=O** (butyraldehyde) has a value of **-1.19305086**, showing that polar groups (C=O) can significantly reduce the value.

3. **Chlorinated Alkenes**:
   - The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a simple dichlorinated alkene. Compared to the examples:
     - It lacks aromaticity or complex functional groups, so its value will likely be lower than heavily chlorinated aromatics (e.g., hexachlorobiphenyl).
     - It has two chlorines on a small alkene, which may give it a slightly negative or near-zero value, similar to **CCBr** or **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** but less negative due to the double bond's polarizability.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The presence of two chlorines will increase the value compared to single-halogen compounds like **CCBr** (-0.64164885) or **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.28517727).
- The double bond (C=C) may slightly increase the value compared to saturated analogs due to increased polarizability.
- The lack of aromaticity or additional functional groups will keep the value modest.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and 0.2**. Averaging the influence of the two chlorines and the double bond, I predict:

**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: -0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.8603212426109452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with no substituents or simple substituents tend to have property values around **-0.4 to 0.8**, depending on the nature of the substituents and ring heteroatoms.
   - For example:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): **-0.4178449**
     - **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): **0.76469654**
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (polycyclic heteroaromatic): **0.30378768**

2. **Heteroatoms in Aromatic Rings**:
   - Nitrogen in aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine-like structures) tends to decrease the property value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect depends on the context.
   - For example:
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (poly-N-heteroaromatic): **-1.30724492** (very low due to multiple nitrogens and electronegative groups).
     - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (poly-N-heteroaromatic): **-1.10210613**.

3. **Simple Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is less electron-rich than benzene due to the electronegative nitrogen, but it is still aromatic and planar.
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline, benzene with N-substituent): **-0.4178449**.
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (poly-N-heteroaromatic): **0.30378768** (higher due to extended conjugation).
   - Pyridine is simpler than these, with no substituents or extended conjugation, so its value should be between these examples.

### Prediction:
Given the above, pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is expected to have a property value slightly lower than benzene-like structures but not as low as poly-N-heteroaromatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.25**  

This is based on:
- The nitrogen reduces the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene derivatives).
- It is not as low as poly-N-heteroaromatics or heavily substituted systems.

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 0.5492809715031548
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxy groups (OCC(O)CO-)**: These are highly polar and hydrophilic, similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = -4.05351294) or `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = -3.36718541). These groups tend to lower the property value significantly.
   - **Ester (COC(=O)-)**: Moderately polar, similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = -0.20457774) or `CCCOC(=O)CC` (property = -0.6769539). This contributes to a slight decrease in the property.
   - **Aromatic amine (Nc2ccnc3...)**: Aromatic amines like `Nc1ccccc1` or `NC(=O)N(C)C` in the examples have mixed effects but often slightly increase the property (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` = -0.6113385).
   - **Chlorinated aromatic (Cl)**: Chlorine on aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` = 0.41435545) tends to increase the property.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule has two fused aromatic rings (naphthalene-like) with a chlorine substituent. Fused aromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property = 2.3250705) or `c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34` (property = 1.53604357) significantly increase the property.

3. **Overall Balance**:
   - The polar hydroxy and ester groups will lower the property, but the fused aromatic system with chlorine and aromatic amine will increase it. The net effect is likely a moderate positive value, as the aromatic contributions often dominate in the examples.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (property = 0.67845916): This has two aromatic amines and no hydroxy groups, so our molecule's hydroxy groups will lower the value compared to this.
- `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C` (property = -0.10057835): This has an ester and aromatic ring but no fused systems or chlorine, so our molecule's fused system and Cl will increase the value.
- `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (property = 0.71773261): This is a fused aromatic system with a nitrogen, similar to part of our molecule, but our molecule has additional polar groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the competing effects:
- The fused aromatic system with Cl and N suggests a value > 0.5 (similar to `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` = 0.71773261).
- The polar hydroxy and ester groups will reduce this, but not below 0 (since even `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` with two esters is only -0.20457774).

A reasonable estimate is **~0.45**, balancing the aromatic contribution (~0.7) with the polar group penalty (~-0.25).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.45** (specific estimate: 0.45 Â± 0.1).

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8005900158891894
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **0.20533037**.
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene) has a higher value of **0.64055412**, likely due to increased branching or steric effects.
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane) has a value of **0.72033259**, which is higher, possibly due to the polarizable iodine atom.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate) has a very low value of **-1.74458971**, likely due to the ester group.
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) has a similar low value of **-1.47768076**.
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a value of **-0.16927269**, which is higher than esters but still negative, suggesting alcohols are less negative than esters but more than pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Alcohols**:
   - The only direct alcohol example is **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) with **-0.16927269**. Linear alcohols like **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) are expected to have slightly higher values than cyclic alcohols due to less constrained geometry.

4. **Chain Length and Polarity**:
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains with polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCO**) tend to have values between **-0.2 and 0.2**, balancing hydrophobicity and polarity.
   - The hydroxyl group in **CCCCCO** introduces polarity, but the hydrocarbon chain dominates, pushing the value toward the positive side but not as high as pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
Given the above trends:
- The value for **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) is **-0.16927269**.
- Linear alcohols like **CCCCCO** should have slightly higher values due to less steric constraint and more flexibility.
- Comparing to **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene, **0.20533037**), the hydroxyl group in **CCCCCO** will reduce the value but not as drastically as in esters.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCO** is slightly higher than **-0.16927269** but lower than **0.20533037**. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: 0.05** (approximately, considering the balance between hydrocarbon chain and hydroxyl group effects). 

However, looking more closely, the alcohol **OC1CCCCCCC1** is cyclic and has **-0.169**, while linear alcohols might be closer to zero or slightly positive. Given that **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) is **0.205**, and **CCCCCO** is less hydrophobic but still polar, a better estimate might be:

**Final predicted value: -0.10** (reflecting the hydroxyl group's impact but not as extreme as cyclic alcohols). 

But revisiting the examples, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has **-0.366461**, suggesting linear alcohols like **CCCCCO** would be less negative. Thus, a more accurate prediction is likely between **-0.1 and 0.1**. 

Given the data, I predict:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: 0.00** (neutral, balancing chain and OH effects). 

However, to be precise, averaging the alcohol-like examples suggests a value closer to **-0.1**. 

**Final answer: -0.10** (approximate, based on trends). 

But given the variability, a safer estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.05**. 

After reconsidering, the closest analog is **OC1CCCCCCC1** (**-0.169**), and **CCCCCO** is less constrained, so likely higher. Thus:

**Final predicted value: -0.05**. 

However, to match the examples better, I'll settle on:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: -0.10**. 

(Note: Without a clear model, this is an approximate estimate based on limited analogous data.) 

**Final answer: -0.10**. 

But given that **CCCc1ccccc1** is **0.205** and **CCCCCO** has an OH, which reduces the value, a better estimate might be halfway between **0.205** and **-0.169**, i.e., ~**0.02**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll provide the most reasonable interpolation:

**Predicted value: -0.05**. 

Thus, the final predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is:

**-0.05**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples; actual values may vary.) 

**Final answer: -0.05**. 

After careful consideration, the most consistent estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: -0.07**. 

To conclude, based on the examples, the predicted value is approximately:

**-0.07**. 

However, given the lack of exact analogs, the closest reasonable prediction is:

**-0.05**. 

Thus, the final predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is:

**-0.05**.

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.7097958144461544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))** and a **lactam-like ring (C(=O)N)** fused to a **dihydrothiophene ring (CC1=C...S...CCO1)**. It also has an **attached phenyl ring (c2ccccc2)**.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - Amide (C=O)N (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - Aromatic ring (moderate hydrophobicity).
   - Heterocyclic ring with sulfur and oxygen (moderate polarity).

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Sulfonyl-containing molecules**: 
  - Example: `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.63774887**. This molecule has a phosphorothioate and nitro group, but the sulfonyl group is somewhat analogous in polarity/electronic effects.
- **Amide + Aromatic systems**:
  - Example: `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` has a value of **-0.37966618**. This is simpler but shares the amide + aromatic motif.
  - Example: `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of **-0.38958718**, which is a cyclic amide with two phenyl groups.
- **Heterocyclic + Sulfur**:
  - Example: `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` has a value of **0.1683148**, which is a sulfur-containing heterocycle.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- Sulfonyl groups tend to **increase the property value** compared to simple amides/aromatics (e.g., sulfonyl pushes the value higher than amides alone).
- The fused ring system with sulfur and oxygen may add complexity but is likely in the **moderately positive range** (similar to other sulfonyl/heterocyclic examples).
- The phenyl ring adds some hydrophobicity but is offset by the polar sulfonyl and amide.

### Predicted Value:
Given the combination of sulfonyl, amide, and aromatic features, the property value is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.652**  

This balances the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl (raising the value) and the amide/aromatic (lowering it slightly compared to pure sulfonyl examples).

Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.11179934073694017
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (benzene) is seen in some examples:
   - `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a property value of **-0.2981635**.
   - `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a value of **1.23786638** (higher due to additional polar groups like C(F)(F)F and extra nitro group).
   - Nitro groups tend to contribute negatively or moderately depending on other substituents.

2. **Ester groups (COC(=O) and C(=O)OC)**: These are polar and can increase the property value. Examples:
   - `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has a high value of **2.99832969** due to long aliphatic chains and two esters.
   - `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has a value of **-0.14860965** (less impact due to other groups).

3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (NC=)**: The presence of a nitrogen in a non-aromatic ring (NC=) may slightly decrease the value, similar to `c2ccc1NCCc1c2` (**-0.46827092**).

4. **Methyl groups (C)**: These are neutral or slightly positive contributors, as seen in many examples (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has **0.32226126**).

5. **Conjugated system**: The molecule has extended conjugation (aromatic ring + double bonds), which can increase the property value (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` has **3.13380257** due to large conjugation).

### Comparison and Prediction:
- The nitro group and ester groups will compete in their contributions (nitro tends to decrease, esters tend to increase).
- The conjugated system and aromaticity will push the value higher.
- The heterocyclic nitrogen may slightly offset the increase.

Given these competing effects, the molecule is likely to have a **moderate positive value**, similar to molecules like:
   - `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (**0.42456381**), which has esters and aromaticity.
   - `CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (**1.48903859**), which has carbonyls and rings.

### Final Prediction:
Considering the balance of features, the predicted property value is:  
**0.85** (moderate positive, driven by esters and conjugation, offset slightly by the nitro group). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.1938396948526595
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two amide groups (**NC=O** and **NC=O**).
   - A cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)** embedded within the structure.
   - The molecule is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a fused cyclopropane ring.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests moderate polarity.
   - The cyclopropane ring adds some rigidity but doesn't significantly increase hydrophobicity or size compared to larger aromatic systems.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)**: Property = -0.860. This is a small, polar heterocycle. Our molecule is more polar but also more constrained.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: Property = 1.711. This is a large, complex steroid-like molecule with carbonyl groups. Our molecule is much smaller but shares some polar features.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (purine-like)**: Property = -1.645. This is a polar, heterocyclic system with hydrogen bonding. Our molecule is less polar but similarly constrained.
   - **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (inositol-like)**: Property = -3.367. This is highly polar due to multiple hydroxyl groups. Our molecule is less polar but has strong dipole moments from the amides.

### Key Observations:
- The molecule is small but has significant polarity due to the two amide groups.
- Cyclopropane adds some rigidity but doesn't dominate the property.
- No aromaticity or large hydrophobic regions are present.
- Similar small polar molecules (e.g., pyridine, inositol) have negative values, but our molecule is less polar than inositol and more polar than pyridine.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polarity and size, the property value is likely **slightly negative**, similar to small polar heterocycles but not as extreme as polyhydroxy systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the structural features and the trends observed in the examples (e.g., small polar molecules tend to have negative values, while larger/aromatic systems have positive values).
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.7484534812248392
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCCC`) tend to have small negative values (e.g., -0.097).
2. **Chlorinated compounds** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1`) tend to have small positive values (e.g., 0.00068), but heavily chlorinated compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) have much higher positive values (e.g., 1.341).
3. **Small halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `ClCC`) are not explicitly in the examples, but we can interpolate:
   - `CC#N` (a small polar molecule) has a value of -1.237.
   - `Clc1ccccc1` (monochlorinated benzene) has a value of 0.00068.
   - `ClCC` is a small chlorinated alkane, less polar than `CC#N` but more polar than `CCCCC`. 

Given these trends, the property value for `ClCC` is likely **small and positive**, similar to `Clc1ccccc1` but slightly higher due to the aliphatic chlorine. 

### Predicted property value for `ClCC`:  
**~0.05 to 0.15**  

A reasonable estimate would be **0.10**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâ€”this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.8365792773504072
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring with Chlorine Substituents**: The molecule contains a chlorinated pyridine ring (Cl-substituted aromatic ring with a nitrogen heteroatom). From the examples:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (multiple Cl on aromatic rings) has a value of **2.03537747**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2** (two aromatic rings with Cl) has a value of **1.14125643**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (similar to the target but with biphenyl and CCl3) has a value of **2.84390428**.

2. **Presence of CCl3 Group**: The **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) group is highly hydrophobic and contributes significantly to the property. Examples with CCl3:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a high value of **2.84390428**.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (CCl3 with other groups) has a value of **0.80866365**.

3. **Nitrogen in the Aromatic Ring (Pyridine)**: The presence of nitrogen in the ring may slightly reduce the property compared to pure hydrocarbons or heavily chlorinated aromatics. For example:
   - **c2ccc1ocnc1c2** (heterocycle with N and O) has a value of **-0.34976636**, but this is less relevant due to the lack of Cl.

### Comparison and Prediction:
The target molecule is a chlorinated pyridine with a CCl3 group. It is most similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, but with one fewer aromatic ring and a nitrogen in the ring. The nitrogen likely reduces the property slightly compared to the purely hydrocarbon case, but the CCl3 group still dominates.

Given the examples:
- The presence of CCl3 and multiple Cl atoms suggests a value > 1.5.
- The nitrogen in the ring may reduce this slightly compared to the biphenyl case (2.843), but the heavy chlorination keeps it high.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~1.9**. This balances the high contribution from CCl3 and Cl with the slight reduction due to the pyridine nitrogen.

**Final Answer: 1.9** (approximate, likely between 1.8 and 2.1 based on the trend).

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.5347757938800023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (hexan-3-ol): Property value = **-0.26786684**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.40990811**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.63227522**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.63227522**

   Alcohols generally have negative property values, and the position of the hydroxyl group affects the value. Secondary alcohols (like 2-hexanol) may have slightly less negative values than primary alcohols due to steric and electronic effects.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or branching tend to increase the property value slightly (e.g., compare **CCCC(O)CCC** with **CCC(C)CCO**).
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (secondary alcohol), similar to **CCC(C)CCO** but with a longer chain.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear, secondary alcohol): **-0.26786684**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (branched, primary alcohol): **-0.63227522**
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is between these two: it is branched like **CCC(C)CCO** but has a longer chain and is a secondary alcohol like **CCCC(O)CCC**.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCCC(C)O** is a secondary alcohol with a longer chain than **CCCC(O)CCC** but less branched than **CCC(C)CCO**, its property value should be slightly more negative than **CCCC(O)CCC** but less negative than **CCC(C)CCO**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (interpolating between **-0.267** and **-0.632**).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is **-0.35**.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.5970385846208929
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **1.58831695**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a biphenyl with two chlorines) has a similar value of **1.58831695**.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (a dihydroxy/chloro analog) has a lower value of **0.24631434**, likely due to the polar -OH groups.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine Effects**:
   - Bromine is larger and less electronegative than chlorine, but both are halogens with similar electron-withdrawing effects. 
   - The property values for chloro-aromatics are consistently positive (e.g., 1.588 for dichlorobenzene), suggesting that bromo-aromatics may follow a similar trend.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The 1,4-disubstitution pattern (para) in **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is identical to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a high value (1.588). Symmetrical substitution tends to stabilize the molecule similarly.

4. **Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (chloroform) has a lower value (0.174), but this is aliphatic and not directly comparable.
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a negative value (-0.881), but this is a single iodine in a small aliphatic compound.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity between **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, and the fact that bromine and chlorine have comparable effects in aromatic systems, the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** should be close to that of **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**. 

However, bromine is slightly less electronegative and more polarizable than chlorine, which might slightly reduce the property value (but not drastically). 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **~1.5**. 

For specificity, I would estimate **1.52**, considering the trend and the slight difference between Br and Cl. 

Thus:  
**Predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: 1.52** (approximate). 

(Note: If the property is something like logP or a similar descriptor, this aligns with the trend of halogenated aromatics having positive values, with Br being slightly less impactful than Cl but still significant.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 3.3765590363329196
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in how molecular structure influences the property value. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure (similar to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs). From the examples, we see that increasing chlorination tends to increase the property value (e.g., compare the first two examples: ClC(Br)Br has a low value, while the heavily chlorinated biphenyl has a high value of 5.16480112). 

This molecule is even more heavily chlorinated than the second example (Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a value of 5.16480112). However, it is not fully chlorinated (some positions are unsubstituted), so the value will be high but likely slightly lower than the second example due to fewer chlorines.

**Predicted property value:** ~4.8  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The value is likely in the range of 4.5â€“5.2, but slightly lower than the second example due to fewer chlorines.)  

**Final answer:** ~4.8

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 2.6805568247585967
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one substituted naphthalene-like system due to the central phosphate linker). Aromaticity is often associated with moderate property values (e.g., examples like `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)` and `Clc1ccccc1Cl` have values around -0.5 to 0.4).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)O...)**: Phosphate groups are polar and can introduce significant electronic effects. In the examples, phosphoryl/sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`) have values around 1.0.
3. **Methyl substituents (Cc...)**: Methyl groups are weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic. Examples like `CC(C)c1ccccc1` have values around 0.32.
4. **Bulkiness**: The molecule is large and bulky due to the phosphate linker and multiple aromatic rings. Bulky molecules like `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (value 2.03) or `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (value 2.13) tend to have higher property values.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The phosphate group suggests a value closer to 1.0 (similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with 1.05).
- The aromaticity and methyl groups may slightly reduce this (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has 0.32).
- The bulkiness and multiple rings push the value higher (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has 2.03).

### Balancing Factors:
The phosphate group's influence (~1.0) is somewhat offset by the aromatic/methyl groups, but the bulkiness and multiple rings likely dominate, pushing the value higher than 1.0 but not as extreme as 2.0+ (since the molecule lacks highly electron-withdrawing groups like multiple halogens).

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.45** (a balance between the phosphate group's contribution and the aromatic/bulky structure). 

This is an estimate based on the trends observed in the examples, where similar structural motifs yield values in this range.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.8042163102949784
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the molecule (attached to the benzene ring). From the examples, molecules with **CF3** or highly halogenated groups (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(...)**) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 2.456, 2.929, 3.685). However, this is not always the case if other features dominate.
   
2. **Benzene ring with substituents**: The benzene ring has a **CF3** and a **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** group. The latter is a complex, polar, and halogenated (Cl-containing) heterocycle. Halogenation (Cl) generally increases the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has 2.456).

3. **Polar and halogenated groups**: The presence of **C=O**, **Cl**, and **N** in the heterocycle adds polarity and halogenation, which often correlates with higher values (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(...)** has 2.456).

4. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: Highly chlorinated, property = 2.456.
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Highly chlorinated, property = 2.929.
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Nitro group instead of the heterocycle, but CF3 + benzene + polar group. Likely lower than the above but still > 1.0.

### Prediction:
Given the **CF3 group**, **chlorine substituents**, and **polar heterocycle**, the molecule is likely to have a property value in the **moderate to high range**. It is less chlorinated than the examples with values > 2.0 but more polar/halogenated than simple aromatic systems. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **1.0 and 2.0**. Considering the balance of **CF3** (electron-withdrawing but not as heavy as Cl) and the **chlorinated heterocycle**, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.45** (approximate, likely between 1.2 and 1.7). 

This is based on interpolation from the examples, where:
- Simple halogenation (e.g., 1-2 Cl) gives ~0.4-1.0.
- Heavy halogenation (e.g., 4+ Cl) gives > 2.0.
- CF3 + moderate halogenation (as here) fits in the middle. 

For precision, I would lean toward **1.45 Â± 0.3**.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.503302295263728
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, often with substituents affecting the property.
2. **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Electron-donating group (EDG), which may decrease the property value (more negative).
3. **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which may increase the property value (less negative or more positive).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **c1ccccc1O (phenol)**: Property = -0.64780671  
  (Hydroxy group is less electron-donating than methoxy, and no nitro group.)
- **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene)**: Property = -0.57199663  
  (Two nitro groups, no EDG, less negative than phenol.)
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1 (dimethylbenzene)**: Property = -0.02433038  
  (Neutral alkyl groups, less impact than EWGs/EDGs.)
- **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (chlorinated pyridine)**: Property = 0.83657928  
  (Strong EWGs like Cl and N in ring increase property value.)

### Key Observations:
- The nitro group is a strong EWG, increasing the property value compared to phenol or anisole (methoxybenzene).
- The methoxy group is a moderate EDG, counteracting the nitro group but not as strongly as a hydroxy group.
- The net effect is likely a property value less negative than phenol but more negative than dinitrobenzene.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the EDG (-OCH3) and EWG (-NO2), the property value should be slightly negative but closer to zero than phenol. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on trends in the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 2.287849666806488
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl)**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule is a heavily chlorinated polycyclic hydrocarbon (similar to hexachlorocyclohexane or other polychlorinated cage-like structures). 
   - Examples with multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` has a value of **0.89316315**, and `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has **1.14043538**).
   - The presence of **multiple Cl atoms** increases the property value, likely due to increased molecular weight/polarizability.

2. **Rigid, Sterically Crowded Framework**: The molecule has a **caged, bridged bicyclic structure** with significant steric hindrance. 
   - Similar rigid polycyclic systems (e.g., `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` with **2.3427504**) show high values due to their bulky, constrained geometry.

3. **Comparison to Clusters of Cl-Substituted Examples**:
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane-like): **0.89316315**
   - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (pentachlorophenol-like): **1.14043538**
   - The given molecule has **even more Cl atoms (8 Cl)** and a more complex cage structure, suggesting a **higher value than these examples**.

4. **Trend for Polycyclic + Halogenated Systems**:
   - Bulky polycyclic + halogenation correlates with **values > 1.0** (e.g., `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` at **0.86435806**, `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` at **1.3427005**).

### Prediction:
Given the **extensive chlorination and rigid polycyclic framework**, the property value should be **higher than 1.14** (pentachlorophenol-like) but likely **below 2.34** (very large polycyclic aromatic systems). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.45**  

This aligns with the trend of increasing values for highly halogenated, sterically constrained molecules in the dataset.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1.2107718076382443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., multiple -OH, -NH, or -COOH) tend to have more negative property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` with -4.053, `NC(=O)N` with -2.268).
   - Less polar or nonpolar groups (e.g., alkyl chains, halogens, aromatic rings) tend to have more positive values (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` with 0.893, `CCCCCCCCC=C` with 1.083).

2. **Ester and Carbonyl Groups**:
   - Esters (R-COO-R') and aldehydes (R-CHO) often have moderately negative values unless balanced by other nonpolar groups. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` has -0.611 (ester + aromatic amine).
     - `CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has 0.429 (ketone + amide + aromatic rings offset negativity).

3. **Propyl Formate (CCCOC=O)**:
   - This is an ester (formate group: -OC=O) with a short alkyl chain (propyl: -C3H7).
   - The ester group introduces some polarity, but the propyl chain is nonpolar. Compared to other esters in the dataset:
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.611) has an additional aromatic amine (more polar), so propyl formate should be less negative.
     - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` (0.865) has a large nonpolar aromatic component, so propyl formate should be more negative.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar ester and nonpolar propyl group, the property value for **CCCOC=O** should be **moderately negative but less so than highly polar molecules**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  
*(This is close to values like `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (-0.409) or `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.611), adjusted for simpler structure).*
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9244998115284798
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with 6 carbons in the chain) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **1.00605723**). 
   - Shorter chains (e.g., **CC** or **CCI**) have lower (more negative) values (e.g., **-0.89822628** for **CC**).

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-COO-**, **-NO2**, halogens) can reduce the property value, especially if they introduce hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions. 
     - Example: **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** (catechol) has **-0.8492371** due to two -OH groups.
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C** (cyclic urea) has **-2.0255249** due to multiple H-bond donors/acceptors.
   - Ester groups (e.g., **-COO-**) tend to have moderate effects, depending on the rest of the molecule.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings generally increase the property value unless heavily substituted with polar groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has **-0.57199663** due to two nitro groups).

4. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - Molecules with both long aliphatic chains and polar groups (e.g., **CCCC=C(CC)C=O**) have intermediate values (e.g., **-0.01176835**).

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **decyl acetate** (a 10-carbon aliphatic chain with an ester group **-COO-** and an ethoxy **-OCC**).
- The long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCCCCCC**) would typically contribute to a high property value (similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, which has **1.00605723** for a 6-carbon chain).
- The ester group (**-COO-**) is polar but not as strongly reducing as -OH or -NH groups. Examples with esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**) have **-0.33844958**, but this also includes an amide and aromatic rings).
- The ethoxy group (**-OCC**) is moderately polar but not as impactful as -OH.

### Prediction:
Given the long hydrophobic chain dominates, but the ester and ethoxy groups slightly reduce the property value, we expect a **positive but not extremely high value**. 

Comparing to similar molecules:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (6-carbon chain + phenyl): **1.00605723**
- **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (shorter chain + aldehyde): **-0.01176835**
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like): **1.48903859**

For **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, the 10-carbon chain suggests a higher value than **1.00605723**, but the ester/ethoxy reduces it slightly. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~1.2 to 1.4**.  

Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**1.25** (interpolating between similar cases).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. If the property is logP, this aligns with expectations for a long-chain ester.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0403359705662014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.00656838), but with additional substitutions.
2. **Amide linker (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 1.29096081), which increases the property value.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (c2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) and chlorine substituents are present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.06212595), but here it's part of a larger conjugated system.
4. **Extended conjugation**: The molecule has a large conjugated system with multiple aromatic rings, similar to **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23** (property = 1.17375624) or **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (property = 2.3250705), which tend to increase the property value.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of **chlorine atoms** and **nitro groups** typically reduces the property value slightly (as seen in the examples), but the **amide linker** and **extended conjugation** counteract this effect.
- The molecule is structurally similar to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 1.29096081), but with an additional nitro group and chlorine, which may slightly reduce the value compared to this example.
- The nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature may lower the property, but the overall conjugation likely keeps it in a higher range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of these effects, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** is approximately:

**1.15** (with an estimated range of 1.10 to 1.25 based on similar molecules). 

This aligns with the trend observed for conjugated systems with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, NOâ‚‚) and amide linkers in the training examples.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2.2517235640469404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC))**: These are present twice in the molecule. From the examples, molecules with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CCSSCC**, **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**) tend to have moderately positive property values (e.g., 0.04693657 and 0.63042786, respectively). The presence of two such groups suggests an additive effect toward a higher value.
   
2. **Aromatic Rings and Thioether Linkage (Sc1ccc...cc1)**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings linked by a thioether (S) bridge. Aromatic systems with substitutions (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**) often have positive values (~0.89 to 1.18). The thioether linkage may further increase the value slightly.

3. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, similar to **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (value: 3.37655904), which has multiple halogen substitutions and symmetry. While this molecule lacks halogens, the two phosphorothioate groups and aromatic systems could contribute similarly but to a lesser extent.

4. **Oxygen Substituents (Oc1ccc...)**: Ether linkages (e.g., **COc1ncnc2nccnc12**) tend to reduce the property value slightly, but their effect here may be offset by the phosphorothioate groups.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: 1.36355512), which has one phosphorothioate group and aromatic systems. Our molecule has two phosphorothioate groups and no electron-withdrawing Cl, but the thioether linkage and symmetry may compensate.
- Another similar case is **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (value: 3.37655904), where multiple halogens and symmetry lead to a very high value. Our molecule lacks halogens but has similarly bulky, symmetric groups.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the property value is likely **between 1.5 and 2.0**, balancing the effects of the phosphorothioate groups, aromaticity, and symmetry. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.75** (specific example: 1.75). 

This reflects the additive contributions of the two phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic-thioether framework, while acknowledging the lack of strongly electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., Cl) that would push the value higher.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7106168622361443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule resembles nitrophenol (Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O), where a phenol group (-OH) and a nitro group (-NO2) are attached to a benzene ring.
   - Similar molecules in the dataset:
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methyl-substituted nitrobenzene) has a property value of **-0.2981635**.
     - `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (chloroaniline) has a value of **-0.28517727**.
     - `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` (halogenated benzene) has a value of **0.52239166**.
   - The nitro group tends to reduce the property value (more negative), while the hydroxyl group (-OH) may slightly increase it.

2. **Electron-withdrawing vs. electron-donating groups**:
   - The nitro group (-NO2) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely decreases the property value.
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) is electron-donating, which may counteract the nitro group's effect to some extent.

3. **Comparison with similar structures**:
   - The molecule is similar to `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (hydroxybenzamide), which has a value of **-1.26434518**, but the nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than the amide group.
   - It is also similar to `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (a more complex nitro/ether/chloro-substituted benzene), which has a high value of **1.61123787**, but this is likely due to the additional chloro and ether groups.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the -OH (slightly positive contribution) and -NO2 (strongly negative contribution), and comparing with similar molecules, the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as in molecules with multiple electron-withdrawing groups.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (approximately between -0.3 and -0.6 based on the examples). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O).

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -6.78076001492882
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is a highly oxygenated carbohydrate (a sugar derivative, likely a oligosaccharide or polysaccharide fragment) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (especially -OH) tend to have more negative property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of -3.36718541).
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and ethers increases hydrogen bonding capacity and polarity, which seems to strongly reduce the property value.

The given molecule (`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`) is even more highly functionalized with hydroxyl groups than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (which already has a very negative value). It has 11 hydroxyl groups and multiple ether linkages, suggesting an even more negative property value.

### Predicted property value: **-4.2**  
(Estimated based on the trend that increased hydroxylation and polarity further decrease the value, extrapolating from the examples.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.8958999801771684
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene), which has a property value of **-0.62197107**. This suggests that triple bonds (C#C) may contribute negatively to the property value.
2. **Hydrocarbons**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) tend to have moderately negative values (~-0.2 to -0.6).
   - Unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**) have positive values (~1.08), indicating that unsaturation (double/triple bonds) can increase the property value compared to alkanes.
3. **Functional Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2) can shift the property value in either direction depending on the context.
   - The triple bond in **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** is part of a nitrile group, which is polar and may have a different effect than a non-polar alkyne.

### Analysis of **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a simple alkyne (1-butyne) with no polar functional groups.
- Compared to alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC** with -0.267), the triple bond likely increases the property value due to unsaturation but not as much as a double bond (since triple bonds are more linear and compact).
- The presence of a terminal alkyne (C-H bond adjacent to the triple bond) may slightly reduce the property value compared to internal alkynes or nitriles.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): -0.621 (polar nitrile groups).
- **CCCCCCCCC=C**: 1.083 (non-polar double bond).
- **CCC#C** is expected to be between these, closer to the alkene but less positive due to the triple bond's nature.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **CCC#C** likely has a **moderately positive property value**, but less than a comparable alkene. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCC#C: ~0.45**  

This balances the unsaturation effect (positive contribution) with the triple bond's compactness (slightly less positive than a double bond).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 2.0885403157864726
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in molecules like **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.36355512) and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property = -0.14860965). This group tends to contribute positively to the property value, especially when combined with aromatic systems or halogens.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions**: The **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** fragment resembles **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.89480525) and **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 1.5874959). Multiple chlorines on an aromatic ring generally increase the property value.
3. **Ethoxy and ethyl groups (CCO and CC)**: These are neutral or slightly negative contributors, as seen in **CCCCOCCCC** (property = 0.18076736) or **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (property = -0.77554806).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1.36355512): Contains P(=S), aromatic Cl, and polar groups. Our molecule has similar features but lacks the amide/carbonyl and has more Cl substitutions.
- **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (1.5874959): Highly chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to our molecule's ring but without the P(=S) group.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (0.89480525): Fewer Cl substitutions than our molecule, lower value.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The P(=S) group likely adds ~0.5â€“1.0 to the property.
- The tri-chlorinated aromatic ring (with an oxygen linker) might contribute ~1.0â€“1.5.
- The ethoxy/ethyl groups could slightly reduce the value (neutral to -0.2).

Given these factors, the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is expected to have a property value **between 1.2 and 1.6**, closer to the higher end due to the combined effect of P(=S) and multiple Cl substitutions.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.45** (approximate, based on structural analogies and trends in the given data).
==================================================
Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -1.8158156082115373
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -NO2, -OH, -NH2, -CONH-)** tend to have higher property values if they are large/planar (e.g., conjugated systems like **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** has 2.13).
   - Small polar molecules (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1Cl** has -0.28) tend to have lower values.
   - The presence of **multiple aromatic rings or extended conjugation** increases the property value (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** has 2.93).
   - The hydrazide group is somewhat similar to amides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** has 0.51), but smaller.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The molecule is smaller than most high-value examples but has polar/aromatic features.
   - Similar small polar-aromatic molecules like **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (0.056) or **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (0.746) suggest moderate values.
   - The hydrazide group may slightly increase the value compared to simple amines.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between small size and polar/aromatic features, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.35**  

This aligns with mid-range values for similar-sized polar-aromatic molecules in the examples.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.2721451299399817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group. Similar structures with P(=S) or P(=O) (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` with a value of **0.31495393**) suggest contributions in the range of **0.3 to 0.6**.
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The presence of sulfur (S) in a non-aromatic context (e.g., `CCS` has a value of **-0.95987329**, but here it's part of a larger polar group, so its impact is less negative).
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` with **-1.44326517**) are polar and can lower the property, but in this case, it's part of a cyclic structure (piperidine ring), which may reduce its negative contribution.
4. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: These are hydrophobic and typically contribute modestly (e.g., `CCCCCCCI` has **0.72033259**, but shorter chains like `CCC` have smaller contributions).
5. **Cyclic Structure (N1CCCCC1)**: A piperidine ring with an amide substituent. Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N1CCCCC1`) might have values around **-0.5 to 0.5**, depending on other substituents.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines polar (P(=S), C(=O)N) and nonpolar (alkyl chains) regions, similar to `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` (**0.31495393**), but with additional hydrophobic bulk.
- The presence of the **P(=S)** group is a key contributor, likely placing the value in the **positive range (0.3 to 0.7)**.
- The **amide** and **thioether** might slightly offset this, but the overall structure is more similar to moderately polar molecules with values around **0.4 to 0.6**.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is **~0.55**.

### Final Answer:
**0.55** (approximate, based on structural similarity to given examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.7032274321262372
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a linear, non-polar hydrocarbon with no functional groups or aromatic rings. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCCO** (1-heptanol) has a value of **-0.26677211**. The presence of a hydroxyl group increases polarity, lowering the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
2. **CCC(C)C** (isobutane) is not directly in the dataset, but simpler alkanes like **CC(Cl)Cl** (dichloroethane) and **CC(C)Cl** are more polar and have negative values.
3. **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (a cyclohexane derivative) has a value of **0.33772432**, suggesting cyclic alkanes may have slightly higher values than linear ones.
4. **CCCC/C=C/C** (a linear alkene) has a value of **0.28305623**, indicating unsaturation slightly increases the value.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a linear alkane with no unsaturation or functional groups, its value should be **higher than polar molecules but lower than cyclic/unsaturated hydrocarbons**. 

Given the trend, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCC** is:  
**~0.25 to 0.35**.  

A specific estimate based on the closest analogs (e.g., **C/C1CCCCC1\C** and **CCCC/C=C/C**) would be:  
**Predicted value: 0.30 Â± 0.05**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, etc.â€”this is an empirical estimate based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.18364102236104513
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Presence of polar functional groups** (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, carbonyl `C=O`, nitro `NO2`, halogens) which tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
2. **Aromaticity and conjugation**, which can increase or decrease the property depending on substituents.
3. **Size and branching of aliphatic chains**, where larger/cyclic alkanes tend to have positive values, while small/aliphatic chains are more negative.
4. **Special cases** like highly halogenated or sterically crowded structures (e.g., `ClC2=C(Cl)C3(Cl)C1C=CCC1C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl`) have very high positive values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

1. **Structure**: This is a steroid-like molecule with:
   - Multiple fused rings (rigid, hydrophobic framework).
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`-OH`, polar, likely decreasing the property).
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`, polar, decreasing effect).
   - An alkyne (`C#C`, slightly polar but less impactful than `-OH` or `C=O`).

2. **Comparable Examples**:
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (property = **1.05381484**): Similar fused rings, one `C=O`, one `-OH`. Positive value due to size and limited polar groups.
   - `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = **-0.30330874**): More polar groups (`-OH`, `C=O`, `F`) reduce the value further.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The target has **two `-OH` groups and one `C=O`**, similar to the second example but without the additional `F` and `C=O` in the side chain. Its size and rigidity will push the value toward the positive range, but the polar groups will offset this.
   - The alkyne (`C#C`) is a minor factor but less polar than `-OH`/`C=O`.

### Final Prediction:
The property value is likely **slightly positive**, similar to the first comparable example but adjusted downward due to the extra `-OH`. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75** (range: 0.6 to 0.9).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, etc.â€”this is based on trends in the given data.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.684480174254804
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule requires analyzing its structural features in the context of the provided examples. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems and Substitution**: 
   - Highly conjugated or polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54`) tend to have **higher positive values (~2.0â€“2.9)**.
   - Simple aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`) have **moderate negative values (~-0.2 to -0.8)**.

2. **Halogenation**: 
   - Multiple halogens (Cl, Br, F) increase the value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = **1.34**).
   - Single halogens have smaller effects.

3. **Oxygen/Nitrogen Functional Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., alcohols, carbonyls, amines) generally **decrease the value** (e.g., `CCCCOCCO` = **-1.06**).
   - Amides, ureas, and heterocycles (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1`) yield **strongly negative values (~-2.0 to -3.0)**.

4. **Molecular Complexity**:
   - Large, rigid polycyclic systems (e.g., steroids like `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`) have **high positive values (~2.0â€“2.5)**.
   - Flexible aliphatic chains or small rings (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O`) have **near-zero or negative values**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is highly complex with:
- **Multiple aromatic rings** (benzene and fused polycyclic systems).
- **Oxygen-rich substituents**: Methoxy (`OCH3`), hydroxyl (`OH`), and ether linkages (`OCO`).
- **Fused polycyclic core**: Likely contributing to rigidity and conjugation.
- **Lactone or carbonyl group** (`COC2=O`), which is polar but offset by the aromaticity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are **polycyclic aromatic systems with oxygen substituents** (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` = **2.26**) and **oxygenated steroids** (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` = **2.17**).
- The oxygen substituents would slightly reduce the value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the **size and rigidity dominate**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between **high conjugation/rigidity (positive contribution)** and **polar oxygen groups (negative contribution)**, the predicted value is:  
**~2.1 to 2.4**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**2.25** (similar to the polycyclic aromatic examples with moderate polar substitution).  

### Final Answer:
**2.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.20074618465249824
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a property value of **-0.71061686**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol) also has the same value (**-0.71061686**), suggesting that the position of the nitro group does not significantly affect the property in this case.
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly listed but implied) would likely have a more negative value than its derivatives.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a value of **0.41435545**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has a higher value of **1.58831695**, indicating that adding more halogens or aromatic rings increases the property value.
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of **0.78971113**, showing that fused rings increase the value compared to single-ring chlorinated aromatics.

3. **Combined Substituents**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has both an electron-donating hydroxyl group (-OH) and an electron-withdrawing chlorine (-Cl) on the same benzene ring. 
   - The hydroxyl group tends to decrease the property value (as seen in phenol derivatives), while the chlorine tends to increase it (as seen in chlorinated aromatics).

### Comparison:
- **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -0.71061686 (strong electron-withdrawing nitro group).
- **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): 0.41435545 (halogen substituents increase value).
- **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene): -0.35120319 (weaker electron-withdrawing effect than Cl).

### Prediction:
For **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- The hydroxyl group will contribute a negative shift (similar to nitrophenol but less extreme since -OH is less electron-withdrawing than -NOâ‚‚).
- The chlorine will contribute a positive shift (but less than iodine in chloroiodobenzene).
- The net effect is likely a value between the nitrophenol and chlorobenzene examples.

A reasonable estimate is slightly higher than fluorobenzene (-0.351) but lower than chloroiodobenzene (0.414). Given the balance between -OH and -Cl, a value around **-0.4 to -0.2** seems plausible. 

Looking at the examples, **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) is -0.351, and chlorine is less electronegative than fluorine but more than iodine. Since **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has competing effects, a value closer to fluorobenzene but slightly less negative is reasonable.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on trends). 

However, reviewing the examples more carefully, **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is -0.710, and **Clc1ccccc1I** is +0.414. Since -OH is less electron-withdrawing than -NOâ‚‚ and -Cl is less electron-donating than -I, the value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** should be between these two but closer to the nitrophenol due to the stronger influence of -OH. 

A more precise estimate is **-0.5**.

### Exact Value:
After cross-referencing similar structures, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.55** (similar to the nitrophenol but adjusted for the weaker electron-withdrawing effect of -Cl compared to -NOâ‚‚). 

However, looking at **Fc1ccccc1** (-0.351) and considering that -OH is more electron-donating than -F, the value should be more negative than -0.351. 

Given the data, the best fit is:  
**-0.55** (interpolated from the trends). 

But to match the examples more closely, a value like **-0.6** might also be reasonable. 

Given the uncertainty, I will provide the closest plausible value based on the examples:  
**Predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.55**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends. The true value could vary slightly depending on the specific property's dependence on substituent effects.) 

### Refined Answer:
After further consideration, the value is likely closer to **-0.5** to **-0.6**. A precise estimate is:  
**-0.55**.  

However, to align with the examples more rigorously, the prediction is:  
**-0.55**.  

(If the property is logarithmic or has nonlinear dependencies, this could vary. But based on the given data, **-0.55** is a reasonable interpolation.)

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.5416862794457495
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - Two **chlorine atoms (Cl)** attached to an aromatic ring and an aliphatic chain.
   - **Alkyne group (C#C)** in the aliphatic chain.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**, resembling an amide or carbamate.
   - **Aromatic ring** substituted with chlorine and an amide-like group.

2. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - Molecules with **multiple chlorine atoms** (e.g., `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`) tend to have property values in the **0.7â€“0.9 range**.
   - The **amide/carbamate-like group (OC(=O)N)** is somewhat similar to `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.570) and `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.837), suggesting a **moderate positive contribution**.
   - The **alkyne group (C#C)** is uncommon in the examples, but its presence in a polar chain might slightly **reduce hydrophobicity** (lower the property value slightly).
   - The **aromatic ring with chlorine** is similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 3.824), but this molecule has many more chlorines. A better match is `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property = 0.790).

3. **Estimated Contributions**:
   - The two chlorines and aromatic ring suggest a **baseline ~0.7â€“0.8**.
   - The **OC(=O)N group** adds a slight positive effect (~+0.1 to +0.2).
   - The **alkyne group** might slightly offset this (~-0.1 to -0.2).

### Predicted Property:
Considering these factors, the predicted property value for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is approximately:

**0.75** (with an expected range of 0.7â€“0.8). 

This aligns with the trends observed in the given examples for similar structures.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1.1827193414802604
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central oxygen (O) connected to three substituents:
   - A phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (heterocyclic with N atoms): **c2cncnc2**
   - Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent: **c3ccccc3Cl**

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (phenyl groups), each with a chlorine substituent.
   - A heterocyclic ring (pyrimidine-like, **c2cncnc2**), which is polar and likely contributes to lower property values (as seen in other N-containing heterocycles like **Nc1nc[nH]n1** with a very low value of -2.019).
   - The oxygen linker (O) may slightly increase polarity but is not as impactful as the heterocycle or halogens.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **2.8439**, but this is heavily influenced by multiple Cl atoms and a bulky structure. Our molecule is less bulky but has similar Cl substitutions.
   - **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine) has a value of **0.7466**, which is lower due to the N linker and lack of halogens.
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (dichlorobenzene) has a value of **0.4477**, which is modest due to the two Cl atoms.
   - The pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**) is similar to **Nc1nc[nH]n1** (value: -2.0198), but our molecule's pyrimidine is less polar due to lack of NH groups.

4. **Property Trends**:
   - Chlorine substitutions generally increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** = 0.4477, **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** = 1.6404).
   - Heterocycles with N atoms (especially polar ones like **Nc1nc[nH]n1**) decrease the value.
   - The oxygen linker is neutral to slightly negative in impact.

### Prediction:
Given the two Cl atoms (increasing the value) and the pyrimidine-like ring (decreasing the value), the net effect is likely a modest positive value. The closest analogs are:
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (0.4477) for the Cl-substituted rings.
- The pyrimidine-like ring may reduce this by ~0.5â€“1.0 units compared to purely Cl-substituted aromatics.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is **~0.3 to 0.6**. Given the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.943862855242404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have higher (less negative) property values (e.g., `CCCCBr` = -0.107, `CCCCCC=O` = -0.392, `CCCCCCCCC(=O)C` = 0.675).
   - Branching or cyclic structures often increase the property value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` = 0.534, `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1` = 0.640).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (`COO` or `COC=O`)**:
     - `CC(=O)OCC` = -0.676 (ethyl acetate).
     - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...` (complex ester) = -0.394.
     - Esters generally have negative values, but the exact value depends on the rest of the structure.
   - **Aldehydes (`C=O` terminal)**:
     - `CCCCCC=O` = -0.392 (hexanal).
     - Terminal aldehydes tend to have moderately negative values.
   - **Ethers (`COC`)**:
     - `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` = -0.522.
     - Ethers alone don't seem to drastically affect the property.

3. **Combination of Features**:
   - The molecule `CCCCOC=O` is a butyl formate, combining:
     - A 4-carbon chain (`CCCC`).
     - An ester linkage (`OC=O`).
   - Compared to `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate, -0.676), `CCCCOC=O` has a longer carbon chain, which would likely increase the property value slightly.
   - Compared to `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal, -0.392), `CCCCOC=O` replaces a terminal aldehyde with an ester, which might lower the value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Esters with short chains (e.g., ethyl acetate) have values around -0.6 to -0.7.
- Longer chains (e.g., butyl group) increase the value by ~0.2-0.3.
- The formate (`HOC=O`) part might slightly lower the value compared to acetate (`CH3C=O`).

Thus, for **CCCCOC=O**, I predict a property value between **-0.5 and -0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6277594560963434
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine-containing molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): Property value = **-0.59868068**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): Property value = **1.78892629**
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4-chloroaniline): Property value = **-0.28517727**
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)N1C=CN(C=C1)C(NC=O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Property value = **0.062947**

   Smaller, aliphatic chlorine-containing molecules (like ClCCCl) tend to have negative property values, while larger or aromatic chlorine-containing molecules (like hexachlorobenzene) have positive values.

2. **Simple halogenated alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl**: -0.59868068
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): -0.64164885
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is structurally simpler than ClCCCl but similar in terms of being a small, aliphatic chlorine-containing molecule.

3. **Trend in halogenated alkanes**:
   - The property value becomes more negative as the molecule becomes simpler and less substituted (e.g., **ClCCCl** is -0.598, while **CCBr** is -0.641). **ClCCl** is even simpler, so its value might be slightly more negative than **ClCCCl**.

4. **Comparison to other small molecules**:
   - **CNN** (methylhydrazine): -2.23017106 (very negative due to small size and polar N-H bonds)
   - **CCCCOCCO**: -1.05614114 (small polar molecule)
   - **ClCCl** is less polar than these but still small, so its value should be less negative.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
Given that **ClCCCl** has a value of **-0.59868068** and **ClCCl** is even simpler (fewer carbons, less molecular complexity), its property value should be slightly more negative. However, it is not as extreme as very small polar molecules like **CNN**.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** would be around **-0.65**, slightly more negative than **ClCCCl** but less negative than **CCBr** (-0.641) due to the smaller size of **ClCCl**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **-0.65**.
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.22576077398751995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = **-0.8492371**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (alkyl-substituted phenol): Property = **0.33185383**
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** (diphenylmethanol derivative): Property = **0.07841006**

   The presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring tends to lower the property value (more negative), but alkyl substitutions (e.g., methyl groups) can increase it.

2. **Methyl-Substituted Phenols**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol based on the SMILES notation). 
   - Comparing to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (which has a tert-butyl and methyl substitution), the property is **0.33185383**. 
   - For **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, the substitutions are less bulky (two methyl groups), so the property value might be slightly lower but still positive.

3. **Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple phenols like **Oc1ccccc1** (not in the list but analogous to **Oc1cccc(O)c1**) have negative values.
   - Adding alkyl groups (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**) pushes the value into positive territory.

### Prediction:
Given that **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol, it is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** but with less bulky substitutions. The property value is likely positive but lower than **0.33185383**. 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.2 to 0.3**. Considering the examples, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (specific value could be closer to **0.28** based on interpolation, but without a direct example, this is approximate). 

However, looking at the closest example (**CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** with **0.33185383**), and accounting for fewer alkyl substitutions in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, a more precise estimate might be:

**Predicted property value: 0.28** (approximating between the given examples). 

For a more exact match, if we assume the effect of two methyl groups is additive but less than a tert-butyl + methyl, a value around **0.28** seems reasonable. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.28** (specific to the given examples' trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating the given data trends.) 

**Final Answer: 0.28**

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 2.4824379930340634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **higher positive property values**:
   - Example: **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** â†’ **2.92949851**
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** â†’ **3.37655904**
   - Example: **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl** â†’ **1.14043538**

2. The property value increases with:
   - More chlorine substitutions.
   - Larger conjugated aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** â†’ **1.92070446**).

3. The given molecule is a **biphenyl with 5 chlorine substitutions**:
   - Structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (which has 7 chlorines and a value of **3.37655904**).
   - Fewer chlorines (5 vs. 7) but still highly chlorinated.

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- The molecule is less chlorinated than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (3.376), but more chlorinated than **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (2.929).
- The biphenyl core with 5 chlorines suggests a value **between 2.929 and 3.376**, likely closer to the lower end due to fewer chlorines.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: ~3.0** (likely between **2.95 and 3.10**).  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**3.05** (based on interpolation of the given examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.25076167919270853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene or 2-methylpropene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = 1.08378308  
     This is a linear alkene with a long carbon chain, and the property is positive and relatively high.
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = 0.70322743  
     This is a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane), and the property is positive but lower than the alkene.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isobutylene), which is structurally simpler than nonene but has a double bond and branching.

2. **Branched Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = 0.77294807  
     This is a highly branched alkane, and the property is positive and moderately high.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (branched aromatic): Property = 0.53328422  
     Branching here seems to contribute to a positive but lower value compared to aliphatic branching.

3. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate): Property = -1.36403406  
     This is a small alkene with an ester group, which heavily influences the property (negative).  
     However, **CC=C(C)C** has no polar groups, so its value should be closer to other pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = 0.04289975  
     The carbonyl group reduces the property compared to pure hydrocarbons, but branching may slightly increase it.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- It is a small, branched alkene with no polar groups. 
- Compared to **CCCCCCCC** (octane, 0.703) and **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene, 1.084), **CC=C(C)C** is smaller but has a double bond and branching. 
- Branching tends to increase the property slightly (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** = 0.773), while the double bond also seems to increase it (nonene = 1.084). 
- However, being a smaller molecule, the effect may not be as pronounced as in longer chains.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** would be slightly lower than **CCCCCCCCC=C** but higher than **CCCCCCCC**, likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.0**. 

### Final Predicted Property:
**0.92** (a balanced estimate considering branching and the double bond in a small molecule).
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6277594560963434
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and functional groups. The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is a very simple, small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon. 

Looking at similar small molecules in the dataset:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of 0.49892337, but it is larger and more chlorinated.
- `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (hexachlorobenzene) has a much higher value (4.27068008), but it is a large aromatic system with many chlorines.
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)c1` (4-chlorophenol) has a value of -0.20074618, which is a small molecule with one chlorine and a hydroxyl group.

`ClCCl` is even simpler than these examples, with no aromaticity or additional functional groups. Based on this, its property value would likely be on the lower end of the scale, similar to or lower than small chlorinated aliphatics like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` but not as extreme as very large or highly functionalized molecules.

A reasonable estimate for `ClCCl` would be around **0.1 to 0.3**, leaning toward the lower end due to its simplicity. Given the examples, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.15** (approximate, based on trend interpolation). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that smaller, less complex molecules tend to have lower values in the given dataset.)

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.6933748586463581
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property value of **0.69337486**. This is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring.
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (hexabromobenzene) has a property value of **1.11874603**, indicating that heavy halogenation tends to increase the property value.
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) has a low value of **-0.74845348**, showing that aliphatic chlorination does not have the same effect as aromatic chlorination.

2. **Effect of Oxygen (Phenol vs. Non-Phenol)**:
   - Phenolic compounds with chlorination (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**) have moderately positive values (~0.69).
   - Non-phenolic chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1**) have higher values (~1.12).

3. **Comparison to the Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (both are trichlorophenols), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (1,2,4-trichlorophenol vs. 1,2,3-trichlorophenol in the given example).
   - The property value for **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is **0.69337486**. Since the substitution pattern is slightly different but the functional groups are identical, we can expect a similar value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is likely in the same range. 

#### Predicted Property Value: **0.70** (approximating to two decimal places based on the trend). 

### Justification:
- The presence of three chlorines and a phenolic OH group consistently gives values around **0.6â€“0.7** in the given data.
- The exact position of substitution (1,2,3 vs. 1,2,4) may slightly affect the value, but not drastically.

Thus, the predicted value is **~0.70**. 

(Note: If higher precision is needed, the value could be refined further, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the given examples.)

True Property: -0.684480174254804
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule you've provided is highly complex, with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls, and cyclic structures), which generally contribute to more negative property values in the dataset (e.g., highly oxygenated molecules like sugars or polyols have strongly negative values).

### Key observations from the dataset:
1. **Oxygen-rich molecules** (e.g., sugars, polyols, or multiple hydroxyl/ether groups) tend to have very negative values:
   - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` â†’ **-5.29315826** (a sugar-like molecule)
   - `OCC(O)CO` â†’ **-2.74168383** (glycerol-like)
   - `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` â†’ **-2.54114291** (nucleoside-like)

2. **Aromatic systems with polar groups** (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) tend to have moderately negative or near-zero values:
   - `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` â†’ **-0.71061686**
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2` â†’ **-0.44829209**

3. **Nonpolar/hydrophobic molecules** (e.g., alkanes, halocarbons) tend to have positive values:
   - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` â†’ **5.50758858** (long alkane)
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` â†’ **2.48243799** (chlorinated aromatic)

### Analysis of the target molecule:
The molecule `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67` is highly oxygenated, with:
- Multiple ethers (`OCH3`, `OCO` rings)
- Alcohols (`OH`)
- A carbonyl (`C=O`)
- Fused cyclic structures (sugar-like or flavonoid-like complexity)

Given its resemblance to highly oxygenated, polyol-like structures in the dataset (e.g., sugars), we can expect a strongly negative property value. The presence of the methyl groups and aromaticity may slightly offset this, but the overall contribution of polar oxygen functionalities dominates.

### Predicted property value:
Based on the dataset trends, this molecule's property value is likely in the range of **-3.0 to -4.5**. A reasonable estimate would be:
**-3.87652143**  
(This is an interpolation based on the most similar examples, accounting for its extreme oxygen content and structural complexity.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.3461762723373902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** substituent and a **tetramethyl-substituted carbon (C(C)(C)C)**. The ring also has **amide-like (c(=O)n1N)** and **nitrogen-rich (nnc)** components.
2. **Polarity/Electron-withdrawing/donating groups**:
   - The **C=O** (carbonyl) group is electron-withdrawing.
   - The **N-H** and **S-CH3** groups are weakly electron-donating.
   - The **tetramethyl group (C(C)(C)C)** is bulky and hydrophobic.
3. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** has a property value of **-0.89849996**. This molecule shares similarities (nitrogen-rich heterocycle, C=O, bulky C(C)(C)C group).
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** has a value of **-1.8326334**, but it lacks the bulky group and sulfur.
   - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property: **-1.51455949**) is another nitrogen-rich heterocycle but lacks the C=O and bulky group.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of **C=O** and **N-H** tends to lower the property value (more negative).
- The **bulky C(C)(C)C group** reduces polarity, counteracting the negative effect slightly.
- The **thiomethyl (S-CH3)** group is less polar than oxygen but still contributes modestly.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (value: **-0.89849996**), but with a slightly less polar **S-CH3** replacing an **O** and additional nitrogen in the ring, the property value should be **slightly less negative** (closer to zero). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, etc.â€”this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is approximately **-0.75**.

1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly listed, but substituted benzenes show trends:
     - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline): -0.732
     - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): ~0.322 (alkyl substitution increases the value).
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene): -0.298 (electron-withdrawing NO2 reduces the value).
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether): 0.780 (aromatic + ether linkage).

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC**: -0.410
   - **CCCC(=O)OC**: -0.410 (similar to the above, alkyl chain length doesn't drastically change the value).
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2**: -0.799 (complex ester with many electron-withdrawing groups lowers the value).

3. **Phenyl Esters (ArCOOR)**:
   - The given molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is ethyl benzoate, a phenyl ester with an ethoxy group. 
   - Compared to simpler esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.410), the aromatic ring may slightly increase the value due to conjugation, but the ester group's electron-withdrawing nature counteracts this.

### Prediction:
- The closest analog is **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.410), but with a phenyl ring replacing the alkyl chain. The phenyl ring is slightly electron-withdrawing (inductive effect) but also conjugative (electron-donating resonance effect), likely resulting in a small net increase in the property value compared to aliphatic esters.
- However, the dataset shows that aromaticity alone (e.g., diphenyl ether: 0.780) can increase the value, but ester groups tend to pull it down. 

Given these competing effects, I predict the value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** to be **slightly higher than -0.410** but still negative due to the ester's dominance. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled, but this aligns with the trends in the dataset.)
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.6928959141021991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Alkyl Halides**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane): -0.88112112
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: 0.80866365 (complex, but Cl contributes positively)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 2.03537747 (multiple Cl atoms increase the value)
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): 0.86435806 (Br in an aromatic system)

   Alkyl halides with simple halogen substituents (e.g., CI) tend to have negative values, while aromatic or multiple halogens increase the value.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (2-heptanone): -0.12541505
   - **CCCCC (=O)CCCC** (2-nonanone): 0.40840285
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): -0.26677211
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): 0.54996518

   Longer alkyl chains or unsaturation (C=C) tend to increase the property value slightly compared to shorter or saturated chains.

3. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: 0.86435806 (Br on an aromatic ring)
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is an alkyl bromide, analogous to **CI** but with a longer chain and Br instead of I.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- The molecule is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane), structurally similar to **CI** (iodomethane) but with a longer alkyl chain and Br instead of I.
- **CI** has a value of -0.88112112. Alkyl chains tend to increase the value slightly (e.g., compare **CCCCCCCO** to smaller alcohols).
- Bromine is less electronegative than iodine but still contributes similarly in alkyl halides. The longer chain (7 carbons) will offset the negativity slightly.

Given these trends, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** should be slightly higher than **CI** but still negative. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (specific value interpolated from trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data patterns.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.8682258254725508
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **CO (formaldehyde, methanal)**:

1. **Small, polar molecules with oxygen** (e.g., aldehydes, alcohols) tend to have negative property values. For example:
   - **CCCCOC=O** (butyraldehyde-like): **-0.94386286**
   - **OC1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexanol): **-0.43618164**
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O** (sugar-like polyol): **-3.80336705**

2. **Formaldehyde (CO)** is a small, highly polar molecule with an aldehyde group (**C=O**). Its simplicity and strong polarity suggest it should have a significantly negative property value, similar to other small oxygen-containing compounds but not as extreme as polyols.

3. Comparing to **CCCCOC=O** (a larger aldehyde with **-0.94386286**), **CO** is smaller and more polar, so its property value should be more negative than this but less extreme than polyols like **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O**.

### Predicted property value for **CO**:  
**Approximately -1.2 to -1.5**.  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-1.35** (interpolating between small aldehydes and alcohols in the dataset).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predictedâ€”e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptorâ€”this is based on the trend that small, polar molecules have increasingly negative values in the given examples.)  

---  
**Final answer**: **-1.35** (estimated).  

If you can clarify the property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), a more precise rationale could be provided!
