SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.02482691425928986
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular weight, and structural complexity. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate), we can observe the following:
1. It has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons) with an ester group (**C(=O)OC**), which introduces some polarity but is largely hydrophobic.
2. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (this molecule) is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (last example in the list, but with a shorter chain), which has a value of **0.58137788**.
   - Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O**) tend to have lower or negative values, but the ester group here may offset that.
   - The presence of the ester group likely increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** would be close to the example with a similar structure but slightly adjusted for the longer chain. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.55** (slightly lower than the 0.58 for the shorter chain due to increased hydrophobicity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.5724379641913016
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** scaffold (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl (=O) and an NH group). This is somewhat similar to the structure **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 0.82080244), which also has a cyclic carbonyl and heteroatoms (S/N). However, the presence of a benzene ring and Cl substituent will influence the property.
2. **Chlorine Substituent**: The molecule has a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring. From the examples, Cl-substituted aromatics often have positive property values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** = 1.3305898, **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** = 1.31978548). However, the property is also influenced by other functional groups.
3. **Lactam-like Motif**: The **oc(=O)[nH]** fragment resembles a lactam (cyclic amide), which is present in molecules like **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property = 1.42600191) and **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.15911332). The property seems to decrease when bulky aliphatic groups are attached.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property = 1.42600191): High value due to multiple carbonyls and no bulky groups.
- **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 0.82080244): Similar cyclic carbonyl + heteroatom motif, but with sulfur.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.3305898): High value due to multiple Cl substitutions on aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** has:
- One Cl substituent (reduces property compared to multi-Cl examples).
- A fused aromatic system with a lactam-like ring (similar to **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** but with O/N instead of S/N).
- No bulky aliphatic groups (which tend to lower the property).

Given these features, the property is likely **between 0.8 and 1.0**, closer to **0.9** as a balance between the Cl effect and the lactam-like structure.

### Final Predicted Property:
**0.92** (specific value estimated based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5354017162645509
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **0.84021327**.
   - Nitro groups often contribute to higher (less negative) property values due to their polar and electron-withdrawing nature.

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**, **CCCCCl**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.088, -1.175).
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)C**) can further decrease the property value (e.g., **CCC(C)CC** has -2.287).

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The nitro group's positive contribution may offset the negative contribution of the alkyl group.
   - In **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, the isopropyl group (**CC(C)**) is branched, which would typically lower the property value, but the nitro group raises it.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (0.840): Nitro group on a heterocycle with alkyl/ether substituents.
- **CC(C)N(=O)=O**: Simpler structure with just an isopropyl group and nitro. The lack of additional polar groups (like ethers) may slightly reduce the property value compared to the above example.

### Prediction:
Given the nitro group's strong positive contribution and the isopropyl group's moderate negative contribution, the property value is likely **between 0.5 and 0.9**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -1.1206098369248907
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. The molecule in question is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key structural features of this molecule:
1. **Steroid-like framework**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes, which are often associated with moderate property values (e.g., 0.90216431 for `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`).
2. **Polar functional groups**: It contains hydroxyl (`-OH`), carbonyl (`C=O`), and alcohol (`-CO`) groups, which can influence the property value.
3. **Size and rigidity**: The molecule is large and rigid, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with values around 0.7–1.2).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property = 0.90216431): This is a steroid-like molecule with carbonyl groups, similar to the query molecule. The query has additional polar groups (`-OH`, `-CO`), which may slightly increase the property value.
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 1.77155333): This is a heavily halogenated aromatic, but the query lacks halogens. However, the query's size and polarity may compensate somewhat.
- `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (property = 0.75880741): A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; the query is less aromatic but more polar.

### Prediction:
Given the steroid-like framework and additional polar groups, the property value is likely in the range of **0.9 to 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.05**

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.23591482480508452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution). Aromatic rings are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on substituents.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` → 0.16187674 (chlorinated biphenyl-like structure)
   - Example: `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` → -1.12266909 (methyl and hydroxyl substitutions lower the value)
   - Example: `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` → -1.00709687 (fluorine substitutions lower the value).

2. **Halogen Substitutions (F and Cl)**:
   - Fluorine substitutions tend to lower the property value (e.g., `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` → -1.00709687).
   - Chlorine substitutions can have mixed effects but often lower the value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → -0.41660317).

3. **Amide/Carbamate-like Linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N)**:
   - Similar functional groups appear in `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` → 0.00946991 (thiourea-like linkage).
   - The presence of two amide groups (C=O) may further lower the value due to polarity/hydrogen bonding.

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The fluorine substitutions will likely lower the value significantly.
   - The chlorine substitution on the second ring will also contribute to lowering the value.
   - The amide linkages may add slight positive or neutral contributions, but the halogens dominate.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (thiourea + phenyl) → 0.00946991
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (dichlorobenzene) → -0.41660317
- `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (trifluoromethyl benzene) → -1.00709687

Given that our molecule has:
- Two aromatic rings (one with two fluorines, one with a chlorine).
- Two amide groups (similar to the thiourea example but more polar).
- No strongly positive contributions (e.g., long aliphatic chains or fused rings that increase the value).

### Predicted Property:
The combined effects of the fluorine and chlorine substitutions, along with the polar amide groups, suggest a property value in the **negative range**, likely between **-0.5 and -1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.75**  

This balances the contributions from the halogens (which push the value down) and the amide groups (which may slightly offset the decrease).

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.6612534438175772
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Ethers and Oxygen-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **0.34159334**.
   - **O=Cc2ccc1OCOc1c2** (a benzodioxole derivative) has a value of **0.12046909**.
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol) has a value of **-0.05259694**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a sugar-like polyol) has a high value of **1.8306577**, likely due to multiple hydroxyl groups.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** is a simple ether with no additional functional groups, so its value should be closer to neutral but slightly positive or negative depending on the balance of hydrophobic/aliphatic vs. oxygen effects.

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexylhexane) has a value of **0.37176538**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **0.13999484**.
   - **CCCCCO** (pentanol) has a value of **0.17327971**.
   - Aliphatic chains with no polar groups tend to have slightly positive values, while adding oxygen (e.g., -OH) can increase or decrease the value depending on context.

3. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branched molecules like **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol) have a value of **-0.62624716**, but this includes an -OH group.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** is branched (isopropyl group) but lacks strong polar groups, so its value should be closer to small aliphatic ethers.

4. **Ether-Specific Examples**:
   - There are no exact ether matches, but **CCOC(=O)CC** (ester) is somewhat similar, with a value of **0.34159334**.
   - Simple ethers like **CCCOC(C)C** are less polar than esters, so the value should be lower.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCCOC(C)C** is a simple aliphatic ether with moderate polarity. Its value is likely to be slightly positive but lower than esters or alcohols. A reasonable estimate is between **0.1 and 0.3**. 

Looking at the closest analogs:
- **CCOC(=O)CC**: 0.341 (ester, more polar)
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.139 (branched alkane, no oxygen)
- **CCCCCO**: 0.173 (alcohol, more polar than ether)

Thus, for **CCCOC(C)C**, I predict a value of **~0.15**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C: 0.15**

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.2674320206033272
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often contributes to polarity or dipole moments.
   - It has a **hydantoin-like core** (cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups and an NH group), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - There is an **alkyl chain (CCC(C))** attached, which adds hydrophobic character but is not very long (only 4 carbons).

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **Nc1nccs1** (property = 0.50188122): Contains a thiazole ring with an amine group, somewhat similar in polarity to the hydantoin core here.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = -2.70202135): Contains a bromine and an amide group, but the aromatic ring and longer conjugation may lower the property value more than in our case.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.41660317): A simple dichlorobenzene, less polar than our molecule but with halogens.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (property = 0.80938324): A cyclic urea derivative (similar to hydantoin) with alkyl groups, structurally closest to our molecule.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **two carbonyl groups and an NH** in a ring (like in hydantoin) suggests higher polarity, similar to the cyclic urea example (property = 0.80938324).
   - The **bromine substituent** adds polarity but may not dominate over the hydantoin core's contribution.
   - The **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is not very long, so its hydrophobic effect is moderate.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (property = 0.80938324), but with a slightly less polar bromine replacing one of the alkyl groups, the property value is likely somewhat lower but still positive. 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.4 to 0.7**. 

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.55** (approximately, considering the balance between the polar hydantoin core and the bromine/alkyl substituents). 

This aligns with the trend seen in similar molecules in the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.03041025401403709
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values around **0.7–1.0** if unsubstituted or with neutral substituents. For example:
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic) has a value of **0.703**.
     - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (aromatic with polar substituents) has a value of **0.917**.
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polyaromatics) tend to have higher values (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** has **1.568**).

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused polyaromatic with a biphenyl-like core) has a value of **0.904**.
   - Biphenyl itself (**c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**) is a simpler version of this, with two benzene rings connected directly. It lacks polar substituents or heteroatoms, which would otherwise influence the property.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-donating or withdrawing groups can shift the value (e.g., nitro groups reduce the value, as in **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** with **-0.171**).
   - Biphenyl has no substituents, so its value should reflect the baseline aromatic conjugation.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (dimethyl-substituted naphthalene-like structure) has a value of **0.129**, but this is less conjugated than biphenyl.
   - The biphenyl-like fused system (**0.904**) is a closer analog, but biphenyl is less rigid and has slightly less conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given that biphenyl is a fully conjugated system of two benzene rings (but not as extended as larger polyaromatics), its value should be **slightly lower than the fused biphenyl-like example (0.904)** but higher than simple substituted benzenes (~0.7). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2): 0.85**  

This aligns with the trend of aromatic conjugation contributing positively to the property, while the lack of substituents or additional rings keeps it below 1.0. 

---
**Final answer: 0.85**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.47198690008316185
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features that influence the property. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**) tend to have negative values (e.g., -3.75038216 for isoprene-like structure). 
   - Longer or branched chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**) also have negative values but less extreme (e.g., -0.11043073).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -Cl)** can increase or decrease the property depending on context. For example:
     - **Cl** in aromatic systems often increases the value (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** = 1.12791359).
     - **-OH** in aliphatic systems tends to decrease the value (e.g., **OC1CCCCCCC1** = -1.41825219).
   - **Sulfur-containing groups**:
     - **Thiols (-SH)** or thioethers (-S-) are moderately polar but less polar than oxygen analogs. Examples:
       - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** = 0.41850718 (complex S-containing molecule).
       - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = 1.16381624 (S and Cl combined).
     - Simpler S-containing molecules (like **CCCCS**) are not directly represented, but sulfur's electronegativity and polarizability suggest a modest effect.

3. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic systems with halogens or other substituents often have higher positive values (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** = 1.3305898).
   - Aliphatic systems with no polar groups are more negative (e.g., **CCCCCCCC=C** = 0.19636805).

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- **CCCCS** is an aliphatic thiol (butyl mercaptan) with no other functional groups. 
- The sulfur atom introduces some polarity, but the aliphatic chain dominates. 
- Compared to **CCCCCC(C)C** (-0.11043073), the -SH group is more polar than a methyl group but less polar than -OH or -Cl. 
- Thus, the property value should be slightly higher than a pure hydrocarbon but still likely negative or near zero.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCS** is:  
**-0.25 to 0.10**.  

A specific value within this range, balancing the aliphatic chain and sulfur polarity, could be:  
**-0.12**.  

However, looking at similar molecules like **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (-0.94699574, with -OH) and **CCCCCCCC=C** (0.19636805, with a double bond), **CCCCS** likely falls closer to zero but slightly negative.  

**Final predicted value: -0.08**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples' trends. The actual value could vary if the property is highly sensitive to specific features like sulfur's polarizability.)
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.6293106881916218
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -COO-) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. 
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, aromatics without polar substituents) tend to have more negative values unless they are large or have specific features.
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) can have varying effects, but multiple halogens or bulky halogenated structures often increase the property value.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Alkanes**:
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**, property = -2.287779) tend to have more negative values than linear alkanes.
   - The presence of an -OH group (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC**, property = -0.94731798) reduces the property value further.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
   - Alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)O**, property = -0.06631556) tend to have less negative values than hydrocarbons but still negative unless other features dominate.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alkane with a terminal -OH group (primary alcohol). 
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = -0.94731798): This is very similar but with the -OH on a tertiary carbon. Our molecule has the -OH on a primary carbon, which is slightly less sterically hindered and might have a less negative effect.
  - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property = -0.06631556): This is a smaller branched alcohol with a secondary -OH, but the property is less negative due to smaller size and less branching.

### Prediction:
Given the structure **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, it is a branched alcohol with moderate size. The terminal -OH will reduce the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon, but the branching and size will also play a role. 

Comparing to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.947), our molecule has the -OH at the end, which might make it slightly less negative (closer to zero). A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.8**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO: -0.7** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trends seem consistent with hydrophobicity-like properties.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.20018772162943574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **methyl-dibenzo[a,e]cyclopentadiene** (or a methyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon). It consists of:
- A central 5-membered ring fused to two benzene rings (dibenzo structure).
- A methyl group (**-CH3**) attached to one of the carbons in the central ring.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Similarity to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs):**
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (property: **0.70336053**): This is a methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like structure. The property is positive and moderately high.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (property: **0.1290489**): This is a methyl-substituted naphthalene derivative. The property is slightly positive.
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene, property: **-0.42429741**): Simple aromatic, negative property.

2. **Effect of Methyl Group:**
   - Methyl groups tend to slightly increase the property (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** vs. simpler aromatics).
   - In **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**, the property is **-1.30671863**, but this is a more saturated/sterically hindered structure.

3. **Fused Ring Systems:**
   - Fused rings (like naphthalene, anthracene) tend to have higher property values than single rings.
   - The given molecule has two fused benzene rings, similar to naphthalene but with an additional 5-membered ring.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted dibenzocyclopentadiene. Given the examples:
- It is more aromatic and less saturated than **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (property: **-1.30671863**).
- It is less extended than **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (property: **0.70336053**), which has three fused rings.
- It is somewhat similar to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (property: **0.1290489**), but with an additional ring fusion.

Given these observations, the property value should be **slightly positive**, similar to methyl-naphthalene derivatives but adjusted for the additional ring strain/geometry.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (interpolated between 0.1290489 and 0.70336053, accounting for structure). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the data.)

To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.90931966**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with **C(C)CCC** (a branched alkyl chain) and **CC=C** (an alkenyl group). 
   - Compared to the example molecule (which has **CC=C** and a methyl group), this molecule has a longer/bulkier alkyl substituent (**C(C)CCC**).

3. **Property Trends**:
   - The presence of **alkyl/alkenyl groups** tends to increase hydrophobicity (or decrease polarity), which may lower the property value slightly compared to the example with just a methyl group.
   - However, the **cyclic urea/carbonyl groups** are polar and may counteract this effect.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest example is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **0.90931966**). 
- Adding a longer alkyl chain (**C(C)CCC**) would likely reduce the property value slightly due to increased hydrophobicity, but not drastically (since the core dominates the polarity).

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to the example with a value of **0.90931966** and the modest hydrophobic contribution of the **C(C)CCC** group, I predict a slightly lower value, likely in the range of **0.75 to 0.85**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.82**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.0070968678448626
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) with substituents tend to have property values around **-0.5 to 1.0**, depending on the substituents.
   - For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (chloro-iodobenzene): **-0.49556078**
     - `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1` (diethylbenzene): **-0.74852386**
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (polyaromatic): **1.23424072**

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyls)**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to decrease the property value slightly (more negative).
     - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`: **-0.49556078**
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: **-1.72101169**
   - Trifluoromethyl (`CF3`) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, likely to reduce the property value further than single halogens.

3. **Fluorinated Compounds**:
   - No direct examples of `CF3` are given, but fluorine substituents are highly electronegative and would likely lower the property value more than other halogens.
   - For comparison:
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene): **1.64461406** (high due to multiple heavy atoms and symmetry).
     - `FC(F)(F)` is less bulky than hexachlorobenzene but still strongly electron-withdrawing.

4. **Simple Aromatics vs. Complex Substituents**:
   - The property value tends to be more negative for simpler, less polarizable systems with electron-withdrawing groups.

### Prediction for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`:
- The `CF3` group is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to halogens but more pronounced.
- The molecule is a simple benzene derivative with no additional polarizable or bulky groups.
- Compared to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (**-0.49556078**), the `CF3` group would likely reduce the property value further due to stronger electron withdrawal.

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate for the property value of `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` is:  
**-0.75** (approximately between -0.5 and -1.0, accounting for the stronger effect of `CF3` compared to single halogens).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is **-0.75**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.7658884456521522
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, and functional groups. Let's analyze the molecule in question:

**Molecule:**  
`OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`  
This is the structure of **sorbitol** or a similar sugar alcohol, characterized by multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and a cyclic structure. 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Highly polar, multi-hydroxylated molecules** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **1.8306577**, the highest in the dataset).  
2. **Aromatic or hydrophobic molecules** tend to have **negative or lower values** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1` has **-6.12008973**).  
3. The presence of **multiple -OH groups** significantly increases the property value, as seen in the comparison of simple alcohols vs. polyols.  

### Prediction:  
The molecule `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has **5 hydroxyl groups** and a cyclic structure, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. This is very similar to `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = **1.8306577**), but with a slightly less flexible cyclic structure.  

Thus, the predicted property value should be **close to but slightly lower than 1.8306577**. A reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted property value: ~1.65**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, or another descriptor—this is based on the trend observed in the given data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -1.583770937801043
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule contains a multi-ring steroid-like structure (similar to some of the provided examples, e.g., "CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O" and "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C"). These structures tend to have property values in the range of **0.6 to 1.0**.
2. **Ketone groups (C=O)**: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) can influence the property. In the examples, molecules with ketones often have moderate positive values (e.g., "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C" has a value of **0.95088776**).
3. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**: The molecule has hydroxyl (OH) and ester (COO) groups, which are polar and can increase the property value (e.g., "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" has a very high value of **1.8306577** due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
4. **Conjugated system**: The presence of a conjugated C=O and C=C system (CC(=O)C=CC) may slightly lower the property compared to fully saturated systems.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The closest example is **"CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C"**, which has a value of **0.95088776**. This molecule is also a steroid derivative with a ketone group.
- Another similar example is **"CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C"**, which has a value of **0.68652057**. This molecule has fewer oxygen-containing groups but a similar core structure.

### Adjustments for differences:
- The given molecule has **additional oxygen atoms (OH and COO groups)** compared to "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C", which would likely **increase** the property value.
- However, the conjugated C=O/C=C system might slightly **offset** this increase.

### Predicted property value:
Given the similarities to the examples and the additional polar groups, the property value is likely slightly higher than **0.95088776** but not as high as **1.8306577** (which has many more hydroxyl groups). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**1.05** (rounded to two decimal places). 

### Final answer:
**1.05**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.5077694236898946
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an oxygen-containing functional group (OH), and a carbonyl group (C=O). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple rings and oxygen-containing groups (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`) tend to have property values around **0.2595546**.
- The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and hydroxyl (OH) groups often increases the property value (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` has a high value of **1.42600191**).
- However, the property value is also influenced by the overall size and hydrophobicity of the molecule.

The given molecule, `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`, is a polycyclic structure with both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group, similar to some of the examples. Given its complexity and functional groups, I predict its property value to be in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.35**  

This is based on its similarity to other polycyclic oxygen-containing molecules in the dataset, balancing the contributions of the polar groups and the hydrophobic framework.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.23392227538954682
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: -0.176): Contains an aldehyde and methoxy group on an aromatic ring.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.290): Nitrobenzene (simple nitro-aromatic).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1** (property: -3.471): Amide with a large aliphatic chain (highly negative).
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** (property: 0.225): Contains nitro and amide groups (positive value).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to contribute negatively (e.g., nitrobenzene: -0.290).
   - Amides can vary: Simple amides (like acetamide) may have neutral to slightly negative values, but bulky amides (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1) can be highly negative.
   - The molecule here is an aromatic amide with a nitro group, similar to **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** (property: 0.225), but with a simpler structure.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is an aromatic amide with a nitro group. Given the examples:
- Nitrobenzene: -0.290 (simple nitro-aromatic).
- Aromatic amide with nitro: 0.225 (more complex, but positive).
- The presence of the acetamide group may slightly offset the negative contribution of the nitro group.

Given these comparisons, the property value is likely **slightly negative**, around **-0.2 to -0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.32**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.6688175103222418
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and steric effects. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorodithioate group (P(=S)(OCC)S)**: 
   - Contains a thiophosphate (P=S) with two ethoxy (OCC) and one thiolate (S) group. 
   - Similar to **CSSC** (disulfide, property = -0.335) but more polar due to P=O/S. Likely contributes negatively to the property.

2. **Aromatic heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**:
   - A fused aromatic system with a lactam (c(=O)) and an ether (o), plus a chloro substituent (Cl).
   - Chloroaromatics in the examples:
     - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = 0.162)
     - **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (property = 0.289)
     - The presence of Cl tends to slightly increase the property.

3. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**:
   - Similar to **CCO** (property = 0.696) but less impactful due to being part of a larger polar group.

4. **Overall polarity and size**:
   - The molecule is large and polar, with both electron-withdrawing (P=O/S, Cl) and electron-donating (ethoxy) groups.
   - Comparable to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 0.015), but with more polar P=S and Cl.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar (P=S, Cl) and moderately hydrophobic (aromatic, ethoxy) groups, the property is likely **slightly negative but close to zero**. 

**Predicted property value: -0.25**  
*(Estimated range: -0.3 to -0.2, based on similar examples like **-0.233** for a polyoxygenated aromatic and **-0.335** for CSSC)*. 

This aligns with the observed trend where highly polar/charged groups reduce the property, while aromaticity and halogens moderate the effect.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.29201915330489836
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -9.88698217 (long alkyl chain with OH)
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.5577125 (branched alkyl with OH)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: 1.8306577 (polyol, highly positive)
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: -0.94731798 (mid-chain OH)
   - **CCCCCC(C)O**: -0.94699574 (longer branched alkyl with OH)
   - **CCCCO**: Not explicitly given, but similar to **CC(C)CO** (0.5577125).

   Alcohols with more branching or shorter chains tend to have less negative (or more positive) values compared to long-chain alcohols.

2. **Branched vs. Linear**:
   - **CCC**: -0.06963563 (linear propane)
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.5577125 (branched with OH)
   - **CCCC(=C)C**: -3.75038216 (unsaturated and branched, very negative)
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: -0.72168322 (branched aromatic with OH).

   Branching alone doesn't always make the value more negative; the presence of OH seems to dominate.

3. **CC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a tertiary alcohol (**tert-butanol** with an extra methyl group, or more accurately, **2-methyl-2-propanol**).
   - Compared to **CC(C)CO** (0.5577125), this has an additional methyl group, increasing steric bulk but retaining the OH group.
   - Tertiary alcohols in the examples are not explicitly given, but branching tends to reduce the magnitude of negative values (unless other functional groups dominate).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CC(C)CO** (secondary alcohol) has a value of **0.5577125**,
- **CCCCCC(C)O** (longer branched alcohol) has **-0.94699574**,
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (branched aromatic alcohol) has **-0.72168322**,

The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO** but lacks the long chain or aromaticity that drives values more negative. The additional branching (tertiary carbon) may slightly reduce the property value compared to **CC(C)CO**, but not drastically. 

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction would be slightly lower than **CC(C)CO** (0.5577125) but not as negative as longer-chain or aromatic alcohols. 

**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: ~0.45** (specific value: **0.45**). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. If the property is something like "solubility" or "polarity," the reasoning would adjust accordingly. However, the given examples suggest this is a synthetic or computed property where branching and OH groups play key roles.) 

---
**Final answer: 0.45** (approximate, based on similar molecules). 

(If more precision is needed, a closer match would be **0.50**, but the exact value depends on the property's definition.) 

---
**Refined prediction**: Comparing to **CC(C)CO** (0.5577125) and noting that **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched but similar, the value is likely slightly lower. 

**Predicted value: 0.50** (rounded to match the dataset's precision). 

(If the property is logarithmic or scaled, the adjustment might differ, but this is the best estimate without additional context.)

**Final refined answer: 0.50**.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 1.0251522970899567
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups), hydrogen bonding (e.g., hydroxyl, amine groups), and molecular complexity (e.g., fused rings, conjugation). 

The molecule in question is:  
**O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**  

This is a fused bicyclic heteroaromatic system with multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). The structure resembles purine-like systems, which are highly conjugated and polar due to the presence of nitrogens and the carbonyl group. 

### Key observations from the training data:
1. **Aromatic nitrogen-rich systems** (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` with a value of **1.082**) tend to have positive property values.
2. **Carbonyl groups in conjugated systems** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C` with **0.640**) also contribute to positive values.
3. **Fused aromatic rings** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45` with **1.264**) often have high positive values due to extended conjugation.

### Prediction:
The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is highly conjugated, contains multiple hydrogen-bonding sites (NH groups), and has a polar carbonyl group. These features are associated with **positive property values** in the training data. 

Given its similarity to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (value = **1.082**) but with even more nitrogen atoms and fused rings, I predict a **higher value**. 

### Final predicted property value:  
**1.25** (rounded to two decimal places based on the trend in the data).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5970641349456857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N, -O-) tend to have higher (less negative) property values.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes like CCC(C)(C)C) have very negative values (e.g., -2.287779).
   - Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)OCC) have moderately negative values (e.g., -2.04188212 for CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC).

2. **Size and Branching**:
   - Smaller, branched molecules with polar groups (e.g., CC(C)O, property = 0.69634631) have higher values than larger nonpolar molecules.
   - Methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O) is a small ester with a polar carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) group, similar to other esters in the dataset.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate-like fragment) is not explicitly in the dataset, but esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC have very negative values (-2.04188212).
   - **CC(=O)OC** (methyl acetate) is simpler and smaller, likely less negative than larger esters.

4. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - Molecules with mixed polar/nonpolar features (e.g., CC(C)NC(=O)N1CC(=O)N(C1=O)c2cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c2) have intermediate values (-0.61045746).
   - Methyl acetate is more polar than pure hydrocarbons but less polar than alcohols like CC(C)O (0.69634631).

### Prediction for CC(C)OC=O:
- Methyl acetate is a small ester with moderate polarity. Given that:
  - Esters in the dataset range from -2.04188212 (large phosphate ester) to more neutral values for smaller esters.
  - The presence of the C=O and O groups will increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
  - It is less polar than alcohols like CC(C)O (0.69634631) but more polar than alkanes.
- A reasonable estimate is **slightly negative**, similar to other small polar molecules.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O: -0.55**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the dataset trends, likely falling between -0.5 and -0.6 due to its ester character and small size.)*

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.007028607583580865
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **urea core (O=C(NR)NR')**, where the nitrogen atoms are connected to two phenyl rings (aromatic groups). 
   - Urea derivatives often exhibit moderate polarity due to the carbonyl (C=O) and N-H groups, but the aromatic rings add hydrophobicity.

2. **Aromaticity**: 
   - Two phenyl rings (benzene derivatives) are present, similar to molecules like **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (property = -1.243) or **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = -0.201). 
   - Aromatic rings alone tend to lower the property value (more negative), but substituents can modulate this.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The urea group can act as both a hydrogen bond donor (N-H) and acceptor (C=O), which may increase the property value (less negative or positive). 
   - Compare to **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (property = 0.799), which has an amide group (similar H-bonding capability) and an aromatic ring.

4. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: 
   - The molecule is symmetric with two identical phenyl rings, which may stabilize it and reduce the property value slightly compared to asymmetric analogs.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol with chloro substituent): -1.243  
  (Less polar than urea, but similar aromaticity)
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (amide with aromatic ring): 0.799  
  (Similar H-bonding but smaller aromatic system)
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (carbamate with aromatic ring): -1.163  
  (Less polar than urea but similar aromatic contribution)

### Prediction:
The urea group's polarity and H-bonding will likely raise the property value compared to simple aromatic compounds, but the two large phenyl rings will counterbalance this. Given the symmetry and comparison to similar structures, the property value is expected to be **moderately negative but closer to zero** than highly polar or nonpolar examples.

**Estimated property value: -0.75**  
(Rationale: Between the amide-like polarity and aromatic ring effects, likely slightly negative but not as extreme as purely aliphatic or highly halogenated examples.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.07071910186488432
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of:
- Two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). 
- It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant π-conjugation and rigidity.

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, a large PAH) have **high positive values** (1.06872571). 
   - Smaller aromatic systems like `c1ccccc1` (benzene) or `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophenol) have **negative values** (-1.02282715). 
   - Fluorene is intermediate in size (larger than benzene but smaller than the large PAH).

2. **Substituents and Heteroatoms**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) or electronegative groups often increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has 1.49962534).
   - Fluorene has no heteroatoms or substituents, so its value should be lower than halogenated aromatics.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (large PAH): 1.06872571  
   - `c1ccccc1` (benzene): Not explicitly given, but `Sc1ccccc1` is -1.02282715, suggesting plain benzene would be slightly higher (less negative).
   - Fluorene is smaller than the large PAH but more conjugated than benzene.

### Prediction:
Fluorene's property value should be:
- **Positive** (due to aromaticity and conjugation).
- **Lower than large PAHs** (e.g., < 1.06872571).
- **Higher than simple aromatics** like benzene (likely > 0 but < 0.7).

From the examples, a reasonable estimate is **~0.6 to 0.8**. A precise guess based on the trend is:  
**Predicted value: 0.75** (specific: 0.75000000).

### Rationale:
- Fluorene is more conjugated than benzene but less than large PAHs.
- No heteroatoms or halogens to push the value higher.
- The closest analog is the large PAH (1.068), so fluorene should be slightly lower.

Thus, the predicted property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene)** is:  
**0.75000000**.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 1.1003383309744648
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **c1ccc(N)cc1**: An aromatic ring with an amino group (electron-donating, polar).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple hydrogen bond donors (NH groups) and acceptors (sulfonyl oxygens, aromatic nitrogen), making it highly polar.
   - Sulfonamides and guanidine groups are strongly polar and often contribute to lower hydrophobicity or specific interactions.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., sulfonamides, amines) tend to have lower property values (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** has Cl substitutions and a value of 1.127, but polar groups reduce this).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (a polar cyclic imide) has a value of 0.595.
   - **CNN** (a simple polar hydrazine) has a surprisingly high value of 1.220, but this is likely due to its small size and lack of aromaticity.
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (halogenated aromatic) has a value of -0.259, showing halogens can reduce the property.

4. **Aromaticity and Substitution**:
   - The aromatic ring with an amino group is similar to **Oc1ccccc1** (value: 0.164), but the sulfonamide and guanidine add more polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity from the sulfonamide and guanidine groups, the property value is likely **lower than neutral** (i.e., negative or near zero). Comparing to similar polar/aromatic examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This balances the polar effects of the sulfonamide/guanidine with the aromatic contribution. The exact value could vary slightly, but it should fall in the moderately negative range based on the training examples.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.4855510214907892
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Highly fluorinated group**: The presence of **C(F)(F)F (trifluoromethyl)** is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which typically decreases the property value (more negative).
2. **Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: These are also strong electron-withdrawing groups, further decreasing the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: This is a moderately polar but not strongly electron-donating group.
4. **Alkene (CC(C)=C)**: A weakly hydrophobic feature, which may slightly increase the property value.
5. **Aromatic ring with multiple substitutions**: The substitutions are strongly electron-withdrawing, making the ring less hydrophobic.

### Comparison with similar molecules from the examples:
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (0.87479412)**: This has two aromatic rings with chlorine substituents (electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro or CF3). The property is positive but lower than expected due to symmetry.
- **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.05137674)**: A nitro group and a hydroxyl group (electron-withdrawing and donating, respectively), leading to a near-neutral value.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1 (-1.11967955)**: Multiple polar groups (amide, carbamate) but no strong electron-withdrawing groups like CF3 or multiple nitro groups.
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (-0.34985704)**: One nitro group and a polar heterocycle, leading to a moderately negative value.
- **Brc1ccccc1 (-2.22550467)**: A single bromine substituent (electron-withdrawing but less than CF3 or nitro) gives a strongly negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the **two nitro groups and a CF3 group**, the molecule is **highly electron-withdrawing and polar**, which should result in a **strongly negative property value**. The tertiary amine and alkene may slightly offset this, but the overall effect should be dominated by the nitro and CF3 groups.

Looking at similar molecules:
- The presence of **CF3** is more electron-withdrawing than bromine (as in **Brc1ccccc1**, which has -2.22550467).
- The **two nitro groups** further decrease the value compared to molecules with just one nitro group (e.g., **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, 0.05137674).

However, the **tertiary amine and alkene** may prevent the value from being as extreme as **Brc1ccccc1**. 

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **between -1.5 and -2.5**, leaning toward the more negative side due to the CF3 and two nitro groups. 

**Predicted property value: -2.1** (specific estimate based on the trends in the given data). 

This aligns with the observation that strongly electron-withdrawing groups (especially multiple ones) lead to more negative values, while the amine and alkene moderate this slightly.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5970641349456857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Aldehydes (C=O)**: 
     - **CCCC=O** has a property value of **0.32221767**.
     - **C=CC=C** (not an aldehyde, but a diene) has a property value of **-0.00739012**, suggesting that the C=O group in aldehydes tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons or alkenes.
   - **Ethers (C-O-C)**:
     - **CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol) has a property value of **0.17467688**.
     - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (ester) has a property value of **-0.51119474**, but this is more complex due to the ester group.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has a property value of **-0.1025277**, showing that ethers with additional polar groups can vary.
   - **Combination of Ether and Aldehyde**:
     - The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester-like structure (specifically, a formate ester with a branched alkyl group). 
     - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1cccnc1**) tend to have property values in the range of **0.1 to 0.5**, but simpler formates (like **CC(C)OC=O**) may have slightly lower values due to reduced conjugation or branching.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)O**) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O** with **-0.94731798** vs. **CC(C)(C)O** with **0.17467688**).

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(=O)N** (amide) has a high property value of **1.08218986**, but this is due to the highly polar amide group.
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (similar to the target but with an extra carbon) has a property value of **0.14078618**, which is a reasonable reference.

### Prediction for **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is a formate ester with a branched alkyl group (**isopropyl formate**). 
- The aldehyde (C=O) and ether (O-C) combination suggests a property value in the range of **0.1 to 0.4**.
- Branching (isopropyl group) may slightly increase the value compared to linear analogs.
- Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O (0.14078618)**, but with one fewer carbon, the value might be slightly higher.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **~0.25**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -1.1226690853760035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **3-methylphenol** (meta-cresol) with the structure:
- A benzene ring with:
  - A methyl group (`-CH3`) at position 1.
  - Another methyl group (`-CH3`) at position 3.
  - A hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at position 5.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a property value of **-0.04326442**.
   - `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` (a complex polyphenol) has **-2.13384327**.
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (a phenol fused to a cyclohexane) has **-2.7532499**.
   - Phenol itself is slightly negative, and adding more hydroxyl groups or bulky substituents tends to decrease the value further.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (toluene) is not directly given, but `Cc1ccccc1C` (ethylbenzene) has **-1.53261719**.
   - `CC(C)C` (isobutane) has **-0.38687013**, suggesting alkyl groups contribute negatively but not extremely so.
   - `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (para-toluidine) has **-0.26568449**, indicating that methyl + amine is slightly negative.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The presence of `-OH` (phenol-like) and `-CH3` (alkyl) suggests a balance between slightly negative contributions.
   - The molecule is less polar than polyhydroxybenzenes but more polar than simple alkylbenzenes.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol alone is **-0.04326442**.
- Adding methyl groups (electron-donating) might slightly decrease the value (more negative).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups are present to increase the value.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than phenol but less negative than heavily substituted phenols. 

**Predicted Property Value: -0.15 to -0.25**. 

A specific value within this range:  
**-0.20**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of substituent effects in the given data.) 

---
**Final Answer: -0.20**  
---
(If the property is logP or similar, this aligns with the observed trends for alkyl + hydroxyl substitution on aromatics.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.2626175901375853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)** fragment tend to have property values in the range of **0.65 to 0.87** (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` = 0.871, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` = 0.821).
   - The presence of **P(=S)** seems to contribute positively to the property value.

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - Substitutions on the aromatic ring (e.g., Cl, Br, O, SC) influence the property. 
   - **Electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, Br)** increase the property (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` = 1.330).
   - **Electron-donating groups (O, CH3)** decrease the property (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` = -1.122).

3. **Thioether (SC)**:
   - The **SC** group is moderately electron-donating but less so than **O**. Its effect is likely similar to **Cl** or **Br** but weaker. 
   - Example: `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` has a high value (0.917), but this includes a strongly electron-withdrawing sulfonamide.

4. **Methyl (C)**:
   - Methyl groups slightly decrease the property (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1O` = -0.446).

### Analysis of **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:
- The molecule has:
  - A **phosphorothioate (P(=S))** group (positive contribution, ~0.8).
  - A **thioether (SC)** substituent (moderate positive contribution).
  - A **methyl (C)** substituent (slight negative contribution).
  - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl or Br).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of contributions:
- The **P(=S)** group suggests a baseline of ~0.8.
- The **SC** group may slightly increase this (but less than Cl/Br).
- The **methyl (C)** group slightly decreases it.

Thus, the predicted property value is likely **~0.75 to 0.85**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.82**  

This aligns with similar phosphorothioate structures in the dataset (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` = 0.821). The **SC** and **C** substituents roughly balance out, leaving the value close to the phosphorothioate baseline.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.4996253449195853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **1.64461406**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **1.77155333**.
   - These molecules are heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structures, and their property values are **positive and relatively high (1.6–1.8)**.

2. **Less Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** has a value of **-1.02501967**.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a value of **0.53676344**.
   - Adding more chlorines tends to **increase the property value**.

3. **Target Molecule Analysis**:
   - The target molecule is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with **6 chlorines** (similar to the examples above).
   - It is slightly less chlorinated than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (which has 7 chlorines and a value of **1.77155333**).
   - It is more chlorinated than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (which has 6 chlorines and a value of **1.64461406**).

### Prediction:
Given the trend:
- The target molecule has **6 chlorines**, similar to the first example (value = **1.64461406**), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (two chlorines on one ring and four on the other, compared to three on each ring in the example).
- The property value should be **close to 1.6**, but possibly slightly lower due to less symmetry.

### Final Prediction:
**1.55** (approximate interpolation between the two closest examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)*

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5344205368783032
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - The molecule **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene) has a property value of **-0.06399791**. This suggests that nitro groups alone do not necessarily lead to high positive values unless combined with other features.
   - The molecule **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene) has a value of **-0.08489103**, which is somewhat similar, indicating that highly polar groups can have modest effects.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes like **CCC** (propane) have a value of **-0.06963563**, while **CC** (ethane) has **0.29092951**. This suggests that longer alkyl chains may slightly decrease the property value unless other functional groups dominate.
   - **CCCCCCCCC** (nonane) has **0.37176538**, indicating that very long alkyl chains can increase the value slightly.

3. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro**:
   - The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** has a short alkyl chain (propyl) and a nitro group. The nitro group is polar and electron-withdrawing, while the alkyl chain is nonpolar. 
   - Comparing to **CCC** (-0.06963563) and **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (-0.06399791), the nitro group's effect seems to roughly cancel out the small negative contribution of the alkyl chain.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (an ester with a branched alkyl chain) has **0.14078618**, suggesting that polar groups can push the value slightly positive.
   - **CC(=C)C** (isobutene) has **-0.27266557**, showing that unsaturation can lower the value, but this is not directly relevant here.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The nitro group is moderately polar but not as extreme as trinitrobenzene.
- The propyl chain is short and not highly influential.
- The combination likely results in a value close to zero, possibly slightly positive.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.1**, similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (0.14078618) but slightly lower due to the lack of additional polar features.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 0.08** (slightly positive, close to neutral).
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -1.3988268872051055
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen-Substituted Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of **-0.2594673**. This is a benzene ring with Cl and Br substituents (meta to each other).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (a polyhalogenated biphenyl) has a higher value of **1.3305898**, likely due to multiple halogens and increased lipophilicity.
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** and **COc1ccccc1Cl** (chlorinated anisoles) both have the same value of **-4.58556911**, suggesting that the -OCH3 group combined with Cl leads to very low values.

2. **Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative and smaller than Cl/Br, which may slightly increase the property value compared to Cl/Br analogues (due to reduced steric hindrance and stronger inductive effects).

3. **Position of Substituents**:
   - The property value seems sensitive to substituent positions. For example, **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.259) vs. **Clc1cccc(Br)c1** (not given, but likely similar if Br is para to Cl). In **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, F and Br are para to each other, which may resemble the Cl/Br case but with F's influence.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (just replacing Cl with F and shifting Br to para position). Fluorine is less bulky and more electronegative than Cl, which might slightly increase the property value compared to the Cl/Br analogue.

### Prediction:
Given that **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **-0.2594673**, and fluorine is likely to increase the value slightly (due to its electronic effects), the predicted value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would be **slightly higher** than -0.259 but still in the same general range. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.15**  

This accounts for the para substitution and fluorine's influence while staying consistent with the trends in the data.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -1.964587709669982
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -NH) tend to have property values closer to zero or positive, especially if they are part of a rigid or cyclic structure.
   - Nonpolar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains, halogens like Cl/Br) often correlate with negative values, but this is not absolute (e.g., Cl-heavy aromatic systems like hexachlorobenzene have high positive values).

2. **Cyclic vs. Acyclic Structures**:
   - Cyclic structures, especially those with multiple rings or fused rings, often have higher (more positive) property values if they include polar or conjugated systems (e.g., aromatic rings with heteroatoms).
   - Saturated cyclic structures (e.g., cyclohexane derivatives) tend to have lower (more negative) values unless they contain polar substituents.

3. **Specific Examples for Comparison**:
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (steroid-like, multiple polar groups): **-2.549** (very negative, likely due to size and mixed polarity).
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: **1.371** (positive, likely due to aromaticity and polar substituents).
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: **-0.820** (similar to the steroid but less extreme).
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: **0.809** (positive, likely due to the carbonyl and hydroxyl in a rigid ring system).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**
- **Structure**: Bicyclic (decalin-like) with two quaternary carbons (sterically hindered) and one hydroxyl group (-OH).
- **Polarity**: The -OH group introduces polarity, but the rest of the molecule is nonpolar (alkyl groups).
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to the steroid-like examples but smaller and less polar. The hydroxyl group may push the value toward the positive side, but the nonpolar bulk could offset this.
  - The closest analog is **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property: -0.820), but our target lacks the additional polar groups (C=O, F) and is smaller.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar -OH and the nonpolar bicyclic structure, the property value is likely **slightly negative but closer to zero**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45**.  

This aligns with the trend where rigid, partially polar cyclic structures have values in the range of -1.0 to 0.5, and the lack of additional polar groups suggests a midpoint in this range.

### Final Answer:
**-0.45**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -1.4323709366315613
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 0.45550747). The presence of P(=S) suggests a moderate positive contribution to the property.
2. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (similar to a phthalimide-like structure), which is also present in the reference molecule above. This group is polar and may contribute to the property value.
3. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are present in both the reference molecule and the target molecule, suggesting minimal deviation in contribution.

### Comparison to Reference Molecule:
The reference molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **0.45550747**. The target molecule is very similar but lacks the **SC(CCl)** substituent. The **SC(CCl)** group is somewhat bulky and moderately polar, but its absence in the target molecule suggests a slightly lower property value due to reduced steric and electronic effects.

### Adjusting for Differences:
- The **SC(CCl)** group likely adds a small positive increment to the property (due to sulfur and chlorine contributions). Removing it would slightly decrease the value.
- The core structure (P(=S) + lactam) remains unchanged, so the property should still be in a similar range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to the reference molecule (0.45550747) and the absence of **SC(CCl)**, I predict the property for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** to be slightly lower, around:  
**0.40 ± 0.05**  

### Final Answer:
**0.40** (approximate, based on structural analogy).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.14808365489818273
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, fused rings) tend to have property values around **-0.5 to 0.5**, unless other functional groups dominate.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.4024703) has two aromatic rings and a carbonyl, similar to our target molecule.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Carbonyls in non-aromatic contexts (e.g., ketones, aldehydes) often lower the property (e.g., `CCCCCC(=O)C` = -1.7266122).
   - In aromatic systems, carbonyls may slightly reduce the property but not as drastically (e.g., `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = -0.54202063).

3. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) often have negative property values. For example:
     - `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` = -1.79753279 (indole-like structure).
     - `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` = 0.50003002 (more complex heterocycle with nitrogens).

4. **Substituents**:
   - Methyl groups (`C`) or halogens (e.g., Cl, Br) can modulate the property but are less impactful than polar functional groups.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has:
- A **fused aromatic system** with two nitrogens and a carbonyl (similar to a quinazolinone or benzodiazepine-like core).
- Two methyl groups (`C` substituents).
- A **carbonyl (C=O)** in the heterocycle, which is conjugated with the aromatic system.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.4024703):
   - Similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and nitrogens.
   - The target molecule is slightly simpler (fewer rings), so the property might be less negative.

2. `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = -0.54202063):
   - A diaryl ketone; the carbonyl here is less integrated into a heterocycle, but the value is somewhat comparable.

3. `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (property = 0.50003002):
   - A nitrogen-rich heterocycle without a carbonyl; the carbonyl in our target molecule would likely reduce the property.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.4024703) but with slightly less aromatic conjugation, the property for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = -0.35** (specific value: **-0.35000000**). 

This aligns with the balance of aromaticity, carbonyl contribution, and heterocyclic nitrogens in the structure.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.5906298723332992
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes)**:
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isoprene-like structure): -1.01496402  
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -1.98608135  
   - **CCCC(C)(C)CO** (branched alcohol): -0.62931069  
   - Hydrocarbon chains tend to have negative property values, with longer chains or more branching reducing the value further.

2. **Esters (R-COO-R')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): 0.83584729  
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): 0.34277832  
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate): -0.55548869  
   - Esters generally have positive or slightly negative values, depending on the length of the alkyl groups. Longer alkyl chains reduce the property value.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (**CCO**, **C(C)O**) tend to have values around 0.3 to -0.6.  
   - Ethers (**CCOC**) are intermediate.  

4. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Non-ester carbonyls (e.g., ketones, aldehydes) often have positive values (e.g., **COC=O**: 0.96939853).  

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is an ester (ethyl hexanoate) with a 6-carbon alkyl chain (**CCCCCC**) and an ethoxy group (**OCC**).  
- Comparing to similar esters:  
  - **CCOC(=O)N** (shorter chain): 0.83584729  
  - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (longer chain): -0.55548869  
  - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (branched): 0.34277832  
- The hexyl chain is intermediate in length, so the property value should be between the shorter (positive) and longer (negative) examples.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **ethyl hexanoate** likely has a **slightly negative or near-zero value**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.3 to -0.5**.  

From the closest examples, I predict:  
**-0.45** (similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** but less negative due to shorter chain).  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC: -0.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.13474082305391352
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule is an ester (COC=O) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). This is similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-0.74771194**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), which has a property value of **-0.25457057**.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the ester group (COC=O) tends to give negative property values in this dataset.
   - The absence of additional substituents (like -OH in the second example) simplifies the comparison to ethyl benzoate.
   - Methyl benzoate (COC=O) is slightly less hydrophobic/smaller than ethyl benzoate (CCOC=O), which may slightly increase the property value (make it less negative).

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be close to but slightly higher (less negative) than ethyl benzoate (-0.74771194).
   - A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.70**.

### Final Predicted Property Value: **-0.70** (approximate, likely between -0.65 and -0.75). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is based purely on structural analogies from the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.5263380146910369
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple conjugated diene with no heteroatoms, halogens, or aromatic rings.

From the examples:
- Simple hydrocarbons like **CC/C=C/C** (trans-2-butene) have a property value of **-1.01496402**.
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **-1.21003971**, likely due to the aromatic ring contributing slightly more than aliphatic chains.
- **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a value of **-0.95520284**, which is close to aliphatic alkenes.

Since **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene, it may have a slightly higher (less negative) value than a simple alkene due to increased electron delocalization, but it lacks the complexity or polar groups that would push the value toward positive numbers. 

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: ~ -0.95**  
(Similar to cyclopentane but slightly more negative than trans-2-butene due to conjugation). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.*

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -2.175489742346667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a chlorinated phosphate derivative) has a value of **-1.756**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a high value of **1.772**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a bromo-chloro-fluoro compound) has a value of **-1.790**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated analog of these, and bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine or fluorine, which may influence the property.

2. **Fully Halogenated Methanes**:
   - **CCl4** (not explicitly in the list, but similar to **BrC(Br)Br**) would likely have a negative value based on the trend of halogenated alkanes.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a value of **-1.790**, suggesting that fully halogenated small molecules tend to have negative values.

3. **Brominated Aromatics**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.254**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is not aromatic, but the presence of bromine suggests some similarity in electronic effects.

4. **Size and Symmetry**:
   - Small, symmetric molecules with halogens (e.g., **C1CCCCC1**, cyclohexane) have very negative values (**-5.897**), but this is likely due to their non-polar nature. **BrC(Br)Br** is polar due to the halogens.

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
Given the trends:
- Fully halogenated small molecules (especially with multiple heavy halogens like Br or Cl) tend to have negative property values.
- The value for **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** is **-1.790**, and **BrC(Br)Br** is structurally similar but with larger bromine atoms, which may increase the magnitude slightly due to greater polarizability.

Thus, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is approximately:
**-1.85** (slightly more negative than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** due to the larger size of bromine). 

### Final Answer:
**-1.85**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.45550747280246867
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.71908789). This group often contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, similar to many examples (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** with property = -0.84590466). Aromaticity alone doesn't dominate the property but interacts with other groups.
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present in **C(CCl)**, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.70272595). Chlorine often increases the property value.
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: A cyclic amide, similar to **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (property = 0.63489985). This group tends to contribute positively.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Present, similar to **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = -0.30146657), but their effect is context-dependent.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines features from **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.71908789) and **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (0.63489985), both with positive property values.
- The presence of **P=S**, **Cl**, and **lactam** suggests a higher property value, likely in the range of **0.6 to 0.9**.
- The ethoxy groups may slightly reduce the value, but the dominant features (P=S, Cl, lactam) push it higher.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined contributions, the predicted property value is approximately **0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**0.75**

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.6296499759363634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide group**: `C(=O)N` (present in multiple examples, e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)C` with value **0.839**, `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` with value **0.776**).
   - **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with value **-2.452**, but note the nitro group here is highly negative; chlorine alone is less extreme).
   - **Heterocyclic fragment**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` (oxadiazole-like, somewhat similar to `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` with value **-2.502**, but this is a more complex, fused system).
   - **Tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` (bulky, may increase hydrophobicity/positive contribution).
   - **Dimethylamino group**: `N(C)C` (present in `CN(C)C(=O)C` with value **0.839**).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The amide and oxadiazole carbonyl (`oc2=O`) are polar, but the tert-butyl and aromatic chlorine may balance this.
   - The molecule has both electron-withdrawing (Cl, oxadiazole) and electron-donating (NMe2) groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analogs are amides with aromatic systems, e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (**0.776**) and `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (**0.009**). The presence of chlorine and the oxadiazole may push the value lower than simple amides but not as extreme as nitroaromatics.
   - The oxadiazole fragment is somewhat similar to the negatively contributing heterocycles in `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (**-2.502**), but this is less extreme here.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The amide and dimethylamino groups suggest a value around **0.5–0.8** (from examples like `CN(C)C(=O)C`).
- The chlorine and oxadiazole may reduce this by **~0.3–0.5**, leading to a net value in the range **0.2–0.5**.
- The tert-butyl group could add a slight positive bump.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the balance of polar/nonpolar groups and comparisons to similar structures, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.35** (with uncertainty ±0.15).  

This aligns with the moderate polarity and lack of extreme electron-withdrawing/donating effects seen in higher or lower examples.

**Final Answer**: **0.35**

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1.0681801827248598
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in how certain functional groups and structural features influence the property value. Let's analyze the molecule in question:

**Molecule:** Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl  
**Structural features:**  
1. Two phenol groups (Oc1cc... and O...cc2Cl).  
2. Three chlorine substituents (Cl) on the aromatic rings.  
3. A biphenyl-like structure with an ether linkage (Oc1...Oc2).  

**Observations from the examples:**  
- Phenol groups (O attached to aromatic rings) tend to increase the property value when multiple are present (e.g., COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1 has a value of 0.584).  
- Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings can either decrease or slightly increase the property value depending on context (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a value of 0.875, while Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of 0.537).  
- Ether linkages (O between rings) are present in some molecules with moderately positive values (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO has a value of 1.582).  

**Comparison to similar molecules:**  
1. Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (two aromatic rings with Cl substituents, no O): 0.875.  
2. Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (phenol with multiple Cl substituents): 0.537.  
3. OCC(O)C(O)CO (multiple O groups): 1.582.  

The molecule in question combines multiple phenol groups, Cl substituents, and an ether linkage. The presence of multiple O groups and Cl substituents suggests a balance between positive (from O) and slightly negative (from Cl) contributions.  

**Predicted property value:**  
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is **0.65**.  

This is based on:  
- The biphenyl-like structure with Cl substituents (similar to 0.875 but slightly lower due to additional Cl).  
- The phenol groups (O contributions) pushing the value higher than pure Cl-substituted aromatics.  
- The ether linkage adding a small positive contribution.  

Thus, the predicted value is **0.65**.

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -1.0149640211971238
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, halogenation, and molecular size. 

The molecule in question is **CC/C=C\C**, which is **2-pentene** (specifically the *trans* isomer due to the \ and / notation). This is a simple alkene with no polar functional groups or halogens, similar to **CC/C=C/C** (which is likely *trans*-2-butene) in the examples, which has a property value of **-1.01496402**. 

Since **CC/C=C\C** is slightly larger (one more carbon) but structurally very similar (same lack of polar groups or conjugation), its property value should be close to that of **CC/C=C/C**. 

### Predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C**:  
**-1.0** (approximately, likely in the range of -0.9 to -1.1 based on the trend for simple alkenes).  

For precision, since the examples show that extending the carbon chain or adding slight branching doesn't drastically change the value for non-polar molecules, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.01496402** (same as *trans*-2-butene, as the additional carbon doesn't introduce new polarity or conjugation).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-1.01496402**.

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.08820441504759276
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C** (methane): 0.55687258  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): 0.55482989  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 0.28827837  
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): -0.20703802  
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): -0.93917375  
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 0.69634631  
   - **CC(C)Cl** (2-chloropropane): -0.34436323  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): 0.17467688  

   Smaller, linear, or branched hydrocarbons tend to have positive values, while larger or cyclic hydrocarbons tend to have more negative values. Oxygenated small molecules (e.g., alcohols) tend to have positive values.

2. **Ethers**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -0.74771194  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol): -0.05259694  
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 0.25520899  

   Ethers (R-O-R') show a range of values, but simple ethers like **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether) are likely to have a positive value due to their small size and oxygen content.

3. **Polar vs. Nonpolar**: 
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl) can increase or decrease the property depending on the context, but simple ethers (with oxygen) tend to have modest positive values.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- **CCCOCC** is a small, symmetric ether with no additional functional groups. 
- It is structurally similar to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, 0.69634631) but with an ether linkage instead of a hydroxyl group. Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so the value may be slightly lower.
- It is also somewhat similar to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, 0.17467688), but without the hydrogen-bonding capability of the alcohol.
- The closest analog is likely **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol, -0.05259694), but **CCCOCC** is simpler and lacks aromaticity, so its value should be higher.

Given these observations, I predict the property for **CCCOCC** to be in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.18**  

This aligns with the trend that small, oxygen-containing non-aromatic molecules (like ethers) tend to have modest positive values in the given dataset.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.37950622700903996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - Two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`) attached to the amide nitrogen, contributing hydrophobicity and aromatic stacking potential.
   - A **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)c1ccccc1`), which is bulky and hydrophobic.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: 0.14278962): This is a simple hydrophobic molecule with two phenyl rings. The predicted molecule is more polar due to the amide but has similar aromaticity.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property: 0.01471204): This has an amide with aromatic rings and a heterocycle. The predicted molecule lacks the heterocycle but has a similar amide + aromatic motif.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -2.50968036): This is an aromatic amine (very polar), but the predicted molecule is less polar due to the tertiary amide and lack of free NH.

3. **Polarity vs. Hydrophobicity**:
   - The amide adds polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl and phenyl rings dominate hydrophobicity.
   - The molecule is likely less polar than simple amides but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Property Trends**:
   - Hydrophobic molecules (e.g., long alkanes like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have high positive values (~1.467).
   - Polar but not highly hydrophilic molecules (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC(=O)OCC`) have mid-range positive values (~0.634).
   - The predicted molecule is intermediate: not as hydrophobic as pure hydrocarbons but not as polar as amines or alcohols.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar amide and hydrophobic aromatic/tert-butyl groups, the property value is likely in the **low-to-mid positive range**, similar to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (0.01471204)** but slightly higher due to reduced polarity from the tert-butyl group.

**Final Prediction: ~0.25**  
*(This is an estimate based on structural analogy; the actual value may vary slightly.)*

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -2.7020213491246396
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom (**Br**) and an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**). This is similar to molecules like:
   - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: 0.14150759) – has a benzene ring with an aldehyde and hydroxyl group.
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -1.72101169) – benzene with Br and OH.
   - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (property: -0.26568449) – benzene with methyl and amino groups.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The **Br** atom is electron-withdrawing, which tends to decrease the property value (as seen in **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** with a very negative value).
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (electron-withdrawing carbonyl and electron-donating nitrogen). This is somewhat similar to **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: 0.37950623), but less bulky.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property of **-1.72101169**, but replacing the OH with **CC(=O)N-** (less polar than OH but still polar) might increase the value slightly.
   - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** has a property of **-0.26568449**, and adding Br (electron-withdrawing) would likely decrease this further, but the amide group might offset this somewhat.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing Br and the moderately polar amide group, the property value is likely in the **negative but not extremely low** range. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -1.0**.

Looking at the examples:
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property: -0.41660317) – two Cl atoms on benzene.
- **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.2895735) – nitro group on benzene.
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (property: -1.30671863) – methyl groups on benzene.

The presence of Br and the amide group suggests a value closer to **-0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is approximately **-0.75**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6009015370260021
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not explicitly given, but similar to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene), which has a value of **-1.53261719**.
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **-1.53261719**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): **-0.23843301**.
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methylnaphthalene): **-0.20018772**.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to increase the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CO** has **0.5577125** vs. **CCCC(C)O** with **0.17467688**).
   - **CC(C)CCO** (branched): **0.29201915**.

3. **Isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1)**:
   - This is a benzene ring with an isobutyl (branched 4-carbon) substituent.
   - Compared to ethyltoluene (**CCc1ccc(C)cc1**, **-1.53261719**), the additional branching (isobutyl) should increase the property value.
   - Compared to isopropyltoluene (**CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**, **-0.23843301**), the longer chain (isobutyl vs. isopropyl) may slightly decrease the value.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** should be between **-1.53261719** (ethyltoluene) and **-0.23843301** (isopropyltoluene), likely closer to the latter due to branching.
- A reasonable estimate is **~-0.5 to -0.7**.

Looking at similar structures:
- **CCCC(=O)C** (linear ketone): **-0.02538202**.
- **CC(C)CO** (branched alcohol): **0.5577125**.
- **CC(C)CCO** (branched ether/alcohol): **0.29201915**.

For **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, the aromatic ring with a branched alkyl group suggests a value around **-0.6**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on structural similarities and trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The true value could vary depending on the specific property.)

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.16580861116309184
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **0.64038984**
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): **-0.43787892**
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): **-0.17056974**
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): **0.05137674**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene): **0.70272595**

   Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl) tend to have higher property values, while electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH₃) lower them.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (thiazole with carbonyl): **0.85529957**
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (cyclic ketone): **-1.9207151**
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): **-0.56358926**

   Carbonyl groups can increase or decrease the property depending on conjugation and other substituents.

3. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol) but lacks the hydroxyl and amide groups. The aldehyde (CHO) is electron-withdrawing but less polar than NO₂ or CONH₂.

### Prediction:
- The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is moderately electron-withdrawing but lacks strong polar effects like NO₂ or OH. 
- Comparing to **COc1ccccc1** (**-0.43787892**, electron-donating OCH₃) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (**0.64038984**, polar amide + OH), the aldehyde should fall between these values.
- A reasonable estimate is slightly positive due to the carbonyl's withdrawing nature but not as high as nitro or amide groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.25** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

For higher precision, note that:
- Simple aromatic aldehydes without additional polar groups often have values in the **0.2 to 0.4** range in this dataset (e.g., **CC(C)(C)CO** is **0.29201915**, though not aromatic, it suggests moderate polarity).
- Thus, a refined prediction is:  
  **0.30** (closer to the middle of the expected range for benzaldehyde-like structures). 

However, reviewing the examples again, **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene, electron-donating) is **-0.437**, while **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) is **0.051**. The aldehyde is likely higher than methoxybenzene but lower than nitrophenol.  

**Final Prediction: 0.15** (conservative estimate, accounting for CHO being less polar than NO₂ but more than OCH₃).  

Given the variability, the most plausible answer based on the examples is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.20** (rounded to reflect moderate electron-withdrawing effect of CHO).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.)*

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.8486009991116318
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like ring** (imidazolidine-2,4-dione) with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and a nitrogen bridge (N-C-N). This is a polar, heterocyclic scaffold with potential for hydrogen bonding.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **nitrophenyl group** (N(=O)=O attached to an aromatic ring) is linked via a methylene bridge (N=C). Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.
   - The hydantoin ring itself is polar and can participate in dipole-dipole interactions.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = 0.889): Contains a nitrophenyl group and polar substituents (Cl, O-aryl). High polarity correlates with a positive value.
   - **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.380): Amide-like polarity and aromaticity.
   - **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (property = 0.009): Less polar than our target but shares some features (thiourea vs. hydantoin).

### Key Observations:
- The **nitrophenyl group** tends to increase the property value (e.g., 0.889 in the first example).
- The **hydantoin ring** is polar but less so than a nitro group alone. Its contribution might be similar to amides (e.g., 0.379 in the example with C(=O)N).
- The molecule lacks long hydrophobic chains or halogens (which often lower the property, e.g., Clc1ccccc1 = -6.120).

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity from the nitro group and the hydantoin ring, the property value is likely **positive and moderate**. Comparing to similar structures, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**  
*(This balances the nitro group's high contribution (~0.8) with the hydantoin's moderate polarity (~0.4).)*

### Rationale:
- The nitro group dominates, but the hydantoin ring is less polar than a second nitro or halogen.
- No strongly negative features (e.g., Cl, Br alone) are present to offset the polarity.
- The value fits between the nitrophenyl-containing example (0.889) and simpler polar amides (~0.3–0.4). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on correlating structural features with trends in the given data.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.22908638306419438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **0.08202611**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.59401467**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This difference in bonding (single vs. double) typically reduces conjugation and electron delocalization, which may lower the property value slightly.

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Linkage**:
   - The presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen single bond (as in hydrazines or diphenylamine derivatives) tends to result in lower property values compared to nitrogen-nitrogen double bonds (as in azo compounds). For example:
     - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: **0.59401467** (azo compound, higher value due to extended conjugation).
     - **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Expected to be lower due to reduced conjugation.

3. **Comparison with Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with minimal substitution (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly positive/negative depending on substituents.
   - The addition of nitrogen (as in **Nc1ccccc1**) slightly increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given that **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative (two phenyl rings linked by a nitrogen-nitrogen single bond), its property value should be:
- Lower than **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (0.59401467) due to reduced conjugation.
- Higher than **Nc1ccccc1** (0.08202611) due to the additional phenyl ring, but the nitrogen-nitrogen single bond is less electron-delocalizing than a double bond.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.35**, considering the balance between the additional aromatic ring and the less conjugated nitrogen-nitrogen linkage.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2: 0.35** (approximate, based on structural trends in the given data).

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.9186273135658657
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: a cyclohexane and a diketopiperazine-like ring (formed by the two amides).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amides are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically reduces hydrophobicity or increases solubility in polar environments.
   - The cyclohexane ring adds some hydrophobicity, but the amides dominate the polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.15911332): This has a similar diketopiperazine core with additional alkyl chains. The property is modestly positive.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.70151652): This is a simpler diketopiperazine derivative with alkyl substituents, showing a higher positive value.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.92551097): A lactam (cyclic amide) with a smaller ring, showing a high positive value.
   - **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O** (property = 0.50776942): A steroid-like structure with a ketone, showing a mid-range positive value.

### Observations:
- Cyclic amides (lactams, diketopiperazines) tend to have positive property values in the given examples, likely due to their polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.
- The absence of highly hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains or aromatic rings) suggests the property won't be extremely high or low.
- The bicyclic structure with two amides is somewhat similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**, but with less hydrophobic bulk, so the property might be slightly higher.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.1279135881234439
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy halogen substitution (Cl)**: The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other). From the examples:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.4166**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **1.4694**, likely due to increased hydrophobicity/steric effects.
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N** (trichloroacetonitrile) has a value of **-0.7847**, showing that multiple chlorines can lower the value.
   - **ClC(Br)Br** (bromodichloromethane) has a very low value of **-3.3004**, but this is an outlier due to the presence of bromine.

2. **Biphenyl scaffold**: The molecule is a **biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked). From the examples:
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.7588**, suggesting aromatic systems can increase the property.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a surprisingly low value of **-4.9244**, but this may be due to the alkene group.

3. **Symmetry and substitution pattern**: The molecule is symmetric with chlorines at the 4,4' positions and an additional chlorine on the second ring. This is somewhat similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has a high value (1.4694), but our molecule has fewer chlorines.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarities:
- The presence of **three chlorines** suggests a value lower than the dichlorobenzene example (-0.4166) but not as extreme as the heavily chlorinated biphenyl (1.4694).
- The biphenyl core may slightly increase the value compared to monocyclic chlorinated aromatics.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and 0.5**, leaning toward the lower end due to the halogens.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.3**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trend that chlorinated aromatics often have negative values in the given data, but symmetric/bulky substitutions may moderate the effect.)*

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.7485238569551214
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the molecular structure of **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl substituents (non-polar, hydrophobic groups).
   - Similar molecules in the dataset include:
     - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene, property = **0.40885567**)
     - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline, property = **-0.26568449**)
     - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde, property = **-0.16580861**)
   - The presence of alkyl chains (ethyl groups) tends to increase the property value compared to polar or functionalized aromatics (e.g., benzaldehyde or aniline).

2. **Trends Observed**:
   - Non-polar, alkyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., hexylbenzene) have positive property values (~0.4).
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., -NO₂, -OH, -N) reduce the property value (often negative).
   - Diethylbenzene lacks polar groups, so its value should be closer to hexylbenzene but slightly lower due to shorter alkyl chains.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is likely **between 0.3 and 0.4**, similar to hexylbenzene but slightly lower due to less hydrophobic contribution from shorter ethyl groups.

**Final predicted property value**: **0.35** (approximate, based on structural analogy).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the dataset. If the property is logP or a similar hydrophobicity metric, this prediction aligns well.)*

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9171943883927355
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Nitro groups (NO₂)**: Often associated with positive property values (e.g., `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(C)C)N(=O)=O` has a value of `0.67776072`).
   - **Sulfonamides (S(=O)(=O)N)**: Similar to nitro groups, sulfonamides are polar and electron-withdrawing, which may contribute to positive property values.
   - **Aromatic amines (N attached to benzene)**: Can have varying effects, but when combined with electron-withdrawing groups (like NO₂ or SO₂), they tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `0.16617708`).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)**: Can decrease or increase the property depending on context, but generally less impactful than NO₂ or SO₂ groups.

2. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - The molecule `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (aniline with a nitro group) has a property value of `0.16617708`.
   - The molecule `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` is similar but replaces the nitro group with a sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`), which is also strongly electron-withdrawing but bulkier.

3. **Sulfonamide Impact**:
   - Sulfonamides are more polar and bulkier than nitro groups, which could lead to a slightly higher property value due to increased electron withdrawal and steric effects.
   - For example, sulfonamide-containing molecules in the dataset (like `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`) have positive property values (`0.66881751`), though this is not a direct comparison.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The base structure is aniline (`Nc1ccccc1`), which alone might have a low or negative value (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1` has `-1.07999025`).
- Adding a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) increases the value to `0.16617708`.
- Replacing the nitro group with a sulfonamide (`S(N)(=O)=O`) should further increase the property value due to stronger electron withdrawal and polarity. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is likely higher than `0.16617708` but not excessively so. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.35** (approximate, based on trends). 

This is a rough estimate given the limited dataset and lack of explicit sulfonamide examples. For higher precision, a larger dataset or computational tools would be needed.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.7956629902412076
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (a linear arrangement of four fused rings). Here's the breakdown:
- The SMILES notation describes a system where:
  - Ring 1 (c1ccc2c(c1)...) is fused to Ring 2 (c3cccc4...), which is further fused to Ring 3 and Ring 4 (cccc2c34).
- This is a **fully conjugated, planar, and highly aromatic system**, similar to naphthalene or anthracene but larger.

### Comparison to Examples:
From the given data, observe the following trends for similar PAHs:
1. **Naphthalene-like (2 fused rings)**:
   - Example: `c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (property: **0.70336053**).
   - This is a 3-ring system (phenanthrene-like), and its value is moderately positive.
2. **Larger PAHs**:
   - Example: `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property: **1.23424072**).
     - This is a 5-ring system (pyrene-like), and its value is higher (~1.23).
   - Example: `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (property: **1.17512216**).
     - Another 4-ring system (chrysene-like), with a value ~1.17.

### Key Observations:
- Larger, more conjugated systems tend to have **higher positive values** (likely reflecting properties like hydrophobicity, polarizability, or electronic delocalization).
- The given molecule is a 4-ring linear PAH (tetracene-like), which is smaller than the 5-ring pyrene example but larger than the 3-ring phenanthrene example.
- The absence of heteroatoms or substituents (like Cl, Br, or NO2) simplifies the prediction, as these often lower the value (e.g., halogenated aromatics have values around 1.1–1.8, but pure hydrocarbons are slightly lower).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- 3-ring PAH: ~0.70
- 4-ring PAH: ~1.0–1.2
- 5-ring PAH: ~1.23

For **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** (4-ring linear PAH), a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than the 5-ring pyrene example but higher than the 3-ring phenanthrene example. 

**Predicted property value: 1.10** (approximate midpoint between 0.70 and 1.23, adjusted for size).

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarity and trends in the data. The value is likely in the range of **1.0–1.2**. For specificity, we'll predict **1.10**.

Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and overall polarity/hydrophilicity. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This structure contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), an aromatic system, and a carbonyl group (C=O), suggesting significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. 

Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (dihydroxybenzene) has a property value of **0.23359206**.
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (a complex polar molecule) has a value of **0.57390896**.
- **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (a highly polar sugar-like molecule) has a value of **1.76588845**.

The molecule in question has even more hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings than these examples, suggesting a higher property value due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. 

### Predicted property value: **1.45** (estimated based on the trend of increasing polarity/functionality leading to higher values in the dataset). 

This is an educated guess given the structural similarity to high-value examples like **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** but with slightly less density of -OH groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.821786).
   - The presence of **P=O** (as in `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) gives even higher values (e.g., 1.22214215).

2. **Sulfur (S) and Nitrogen (N) atoms**:
   - Sulfur (e.g., in `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) contributes to positive values (0.85529957).
   - Nitrogen in amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) also gives positive values (0.79916135).

3. **Chlorine (Cl) and aromatic rings**:
   - Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`) have high positive values (1.12791359).
   - Non-chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)c1`) have very negative values (-3.43594131).

4. **Aliphatic chains**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCCC`) have negative values (-1.98608135).
   - Branched or functionalized aliphatics (e.g., `CCC(O)CC`) can have slightly positive values (0.17467688).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- **Phosphoryl group (P=O)**: Present, which is associated with positive values (as seen in other P=O examples).
- **Amide group (NC(C)=O)**: Similar to `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (0.79916135), contributes positively.
- **Sulfur (S)**: Present in the thioester (SC), which is likely to increase the value (as sulfur tends to do).
- **No aromatic rings or chlorines**: This avoids the extreme highs or lows seen in chlorinated aromatics or plain alkyl chains.
- **Overall structure**: Combines P=O, amide, and sulfur, all of which are associated with positive contributions.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1.22214215** (P=O + Cl-aromatic).
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **0.821786** (P=S + Cl-aromatic).
- `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` has a value of **0.85529957** (sulfur + heterocycle).
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has a value of **0.79916135** (amide + heterocycle).

The target molecule lacks chlorinated aromatics but has P=O, amide, and sulfur, which are all positive contributors. It is most similar to the phosphate/amide/sulfur-containing examples, but without the extreme boosting effect of chlorine. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combined effects of P=O, amide, and sulfur, and the absence of strongly negative or positive modifiers (like chlorine or plain alkanes), the predicted value should be in the **range of 0.8 to 1.2**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.9156118613723363
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** Cl\C=C/Cl  
This is *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene, a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a double bond. 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Halogenated molecules:**  
   - Cl-containing molecules often have property values in the mid-range (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a high value of `1.64461406`, while `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has `-1.02501967`).  
   - The presence of multiple halogens tends to increase the property value.  

2. **Small alkenes:**  
   - Simple alkenes or alkanes (e.g., `CC1CCCC1` with `-1.98608135`, `CCCC(C)C` with `-2.287779`) tend to have negative values.  
   - However, halogenation (e.g., `Cl\C=C/Cl`) would likely increase the value compared to non-halogenated analogs.  

3. **Symmetry and conjugation:**  
   - The *trans* configuration and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl may slightly reduce the value compared to a more complex or aromatic halogenated system.  

### Prediction:  
Given that:  
- Small alkenes with no halogens have very negative values.  
- Halogenation increases the value, but the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl likely place it in the mid-to-low range.  

Comparing to similar examples:  
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (dichlorophenol) has `-1.02501967`.  
- `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline) has `-0.88313807`.  
- `CCBr` (bromoethane) has `-0.05303309`.  

Since Cl\C=C/Cl is a small, non-aromatic, but fully halogenated alkene, its value should be higher than simple alkanes but lower than heavily halogenated aromatics. A reasonable estimate is around **`-0.5` to `0.5`**.  

Looking for the closest analog, `CCBr` (bromoethane) has `-0.05303309`, and Cl\C=C/Cl is more polarizable due to the double bond and two chlorines, so its value should be higher.  

### Final predicted property value:  
**`0.25`** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.24684973679605207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values around **-0.5 to 0.5**, depending on substituents.
   - Pyridine (a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring) is similar to benzene but with a nitrogen heteroatom, which may slightly alter the property.

2. **Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): Property = **-0.49190539**
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (methylated purine-like structure): Property = **0.50003002**
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (methylated purine derivative): Property = **0.67449076**
   - Pyridine is simpler than these but shares the nitrogen-in-ring feature.

3. **Heteroatom Effects**:
   - Nitrogen in the ring (pyridine) is less electron-donating than nitrogen substituents (e.g., -NH2 or -NMe2), so the property is likely less negative than **-0.49190539** (N-methylaniline).
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl) are present in pyridine, so the value should be closer to neutral.

4. **Comparison to Benzene**:
   - Pure benzene isn't in the examples, but substituted benzenes with simple groups (e.g., **Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32**) have values around **0.1290489** to **0.2244435**.
   - Pyridine is slightly more polar than benzene due to the nitrogen, but not drastically so.

### Prediction:
Given the above, pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is likely to have a property value **slightly positive but close to zero**, similar to simple aromatic systems with mild heteroatom effects. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

This aligns with the trend of nitrogen-containing aromatics in the examples, where values are often modestly positive unless strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present.

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.20830695301225233
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Structural Analysis of the Molecule**:
The molecule can be broken down into the following key fragments:
1. **OCC(O)CO-**: A polar, hydrophilic fragment with hydroxyl groups (similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, which has a high positive value of **1.8306577** due to hydrogen bonding).
2. **-OC(=O)c1ccccc1-**: An ester-linked phenyl group (similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC`, which has a value of **-1.22375491** due to the aromatic and ester contributions).
3. **-Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**: A substituted indole-like heterocycle with a chlorine atom (similar to `c1ccc2cnccc2c1`, which has a value of **-2.30964014**, but the chlorine and nitrogen may increase polarity).

---

### **Key Observations from Examples**:
- **Hydroxyl groups (e.g., polyols)** tend to **increase** the property value (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` = **1.8306577**).
- **Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, N, O)** tend to have **moderate negative values** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` = **-0.49556078**, `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` = **-2.30964014**).
- **Esters and amides** can have **negative or near-zero values** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` = **-1.22375491**, `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` = **0.00702861**).

---

### **Prediction**:
The molecule has competing effects:
1. The **polyol fragment (OCC(O)CO-)** would push the value **higher (positive)**.
2. The **aromatic/ester/heterocycle** fragments would push the value **lower (negative)**.
3. The **chlorine and nitrogen** in the heterocycle add polarity but may not dominate over the polyol.

Given these competing contributions, the net effect is likely a **slightly positive value**, but not as high as pure polyols due to the aromatic/ester counterbalance.

---

### **Final Prediction**:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.25**, considering:
- Similar to `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (**0.00702861**) but slightly higher due to the polyol.
- Not as high as `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (**1.8306577**) due to the aromatic/ester penalty.

**Predicted value: 0.25** (approximate, based on structural analogy).  

*(Note: Without a clear definition of the property, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)*

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.17327971381637125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (butylbenzene): -1.21003971  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 0.0680988  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): -1.16929006  
   Hydrocarbon chains with simple substituents (e.g., halogens, aromatic rings) tend to have negative property values, but the presence of larger halogens (e.g., iodine) can push the value closer to zero or slightly positive.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): 0.7997293  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.96939853  
   Esters (R-COOR') tend to have positive property values (~0.8 to ~1.0).  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -1.41825219  
   Alcohols (R-OH) tend to have negative property values, especially in cyclic or larger aliphatic structures.

3. **Chain Length and Polarity**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., -OH) tend to have more negative values, as seen with **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-1.418).  
   - Shorter chains with polar groups may have less negative values (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): -0.62624716).

### Analysis of **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- This is a linear aliphatic alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a terminal -OH group.  
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, -1.418), 1-pentanol is less bulky and cyclic, so its value should be less negative.  
- Compared to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (bulky tertiary alcohol, -0.626), 1-pentanol is a primary alcohol with a longer chain, so its value should be more negative than -0.626 but less negative than -1.418.  
- The presence of the -OH group will dominate the property value, pushing it into the negative range.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCO** is between -0.8 and -1.2. Splitting the difference, I predict:  
**-1.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity).  

For a more precise estimate, I would lean toward **-1.05** based on interpolation of the examples.  

### Final Answer:
**-1.05** (predicted property value for CCCCCCO).
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.05019451506163729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** has a value of **-1.73437418** (but this has two aromatic rings with amino groups).
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has a value of **0.23359206** (two hydroxyl groups on benzene).
   - **Fc1ccc(F)cc1** has a value of **-0.9936475** (two fluorine atoms on benzene).

   The benzene ring here is substituted with a **C(=O)N** group, which is polar and may reduce the property value compared to unsubstituted or hydroxyl-substituted benzene.

2. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a highly polar and electron-withdrawing group. Examples with sulfonyl or similar polar groups:
   - **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** has a value of **0.46303584**.
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.05606613**.

   The sulfonyl group here is part of a cyclic structure, which may moderate its effect.

3. **Lactone-like Structure (CCO1)**: The molecule forms a 5-membered ring with an oxygen (O1), which is somewhat similar to lactones or cyclic ethers. Examples with cyclic structures:
   - **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O** has a value of **0.50776942**.
   - **CC34CCc1c(ccc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O** has a value of **0.49846981**.

   These cyclic structures tend to have positive values around **0.5**.

4. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The amide group is polar and can hydrogen bond. Examples with amides:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has a value of **-0.58999968**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** has a value of **0.80938324**.

   The amide here is part of a larger conjugated system, which may increase the property value.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The molecule combines a polar sulfonyl group, an aromatic ring with an amide, and a cyclic structure. The sulfonyl and amide groups are electron-withdrawing, but the cyclic structure may offset this somewhat.
- Comparing to similar molecules, the value is likely in the range of **0.0 to 0.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar groups and cyclic structure, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.35** (specific value interpolated from similar examples). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the closest analog is **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** with a value of **0.46303584**, which also has a polar group (P=S) and aromatic ring. Adjusting for the sulfonyl group being more polar than P=S, the value might be slightly lower. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.42** (rounded from the range 0.35-0.45). 

### Final Answer:
**0.42**
==================================================
Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -1.8449700267592377
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is present in some of the examples, such as:
   - `Cc1cccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with a property value of **-0.8375071**.
   - `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` with a property value of **0.62040896**.

2. **Ester groups (COC(=O))**: These are present in:
   - `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` with a property value of **1.52333348**.
   - `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` with a property value of **-1.55204236**.

3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (NC=)**: Present in:
   - `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` with a property value of **-1.79753279**.
   - `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` with a property value of **-0.2303092**.

4. **Substituted aromatic system**: The molecule has a fused aromatic system with substitutions, similar to:
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` with a property value of **-0.0707191**.
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` with a property value of **1.56844679**.

### Observations:
- The nitro group tends to lower the property value (e.g., -0.8375071 for `Cc1cccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
- Ester groups can either increase or decrease the property value depending on the rest of the structure.
- The heterocyclic nitrogen and aromaticity suggest a moderate influence.

### Balancing the contributions:
- The nitro group and heterocyclic nitrogen suggest a negative contribution.
- The ester groups and aromaticity may partially offset this.

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with property values around **-0.5 to 0.5**, and considering the nitro group's strong negative influence, the predicted value is likely in the lower end of this range.

**Predicted property value: -0.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 1.2035067637693464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a succinimide derivative but with a cyclopropane ring fused to it.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as acceptors). 
   - The cyclopropane ring introduces strain but no significant polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1 (0.24684974)**: A simple pyridine with moderate polarity and aromaticity. Our molecule is more polar due to the amides.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (0.95088776)**: A steroid-like structure with carbonyl groups. Our molecule is smaller but has similar polar carbonyls.
   - **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (1.64116951)**: A highly polar sugar with multiple hydroxyls. Our molecule is less polar but has strong hydrogen-bonding capability.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (1.31978548)**: A chlorinated biphenyl with high hydrophobicity. Our molecule is less hydrophobic but more polar.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of two amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity, but the cyclopropane ring reduces flexibility and may offset some polarity.
   - No aromaticity or extended conjugation (unlike some high-value examples).
   - Smaller size compared to many high-value examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polarity (from amides) and rigidity (from cyclopropane), the property value is likely **moderate and positive**. Comparing to similar-sized polar molecules in the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This places it between simpler polar aromatics (e.g., pyridine at 0.25) and larger polar structures (e.g., steroids at 0.95). The lack of aromaticity or extensive conjugation prevents it from reaching higher values.

### Note:
This prediction is based on qualitative structural comparison without computational tools. For precise values, quantum chemical calculations or machine learning models would be necessary.
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.10442416259451716
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCCC` with a value of `-1.98608135` and `CCC1CCCCC1` with `-0.44294208`) tend to have negative values, with longer chains having more negative values.
2. **Chlorinated compounds**:
   - `Clc1ccccc1` (chlorobenzene) has a very negative value (`-6.12008973`).
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (tetrachlorobenzene) has a positive value (`0.70272595`), suggesting that increasing chlorine substitution can shift the property toward positive values.
   - `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` (a heavily chlorinated polycyclic) has a high positive value (`1.11284332`).
3. **Small chlorinated alkanes**:
   - `ClCC` (chloroethane) is a simple chlorinated alkane with only one chlorine and a small carbon chain.

### Prediction for `ClCC`:
- Compared to `CCCCC` (`-1.98608135`), `ClCC` has a shorter carbon chain but introduces a chlorine atom. Chlorine tends to make the property less negative (or more positive) than pure hydrocarbons, but with only one chlorine and a small chain, the value is likely still negative but less so than `CCCCC`.
- The closest analog is `Clc1ccccc1` (`-6.12008973`), but `ClCC` is less conjugated and simpler, so its value should be less extreme.
- Another reference is `CCC1CCCCC1` (`-0.44294208`), which is a larger hydrocarbon but not chlorinated. `ClCC` likely has a more negative value than this due to its smaller size but less negative than `CCCCC` due to the chlorine.

### Estimated value for `ClCC`:
Given these trends, a reasonable prediction for `ClCC` is **`-1.2`**.

### Refined estimate:
Looking at `C1CC=CC1` (`-0.48889273`, cyclopentene) and `C1CCC=CCC1` (`-1.8004077`, cycloheptene), the introduction of a chlorine in `ClCC` would likely place it between these values but closer to the simpler `C1CC=CC1`. Adjusting for the chlorine effect, a plausible value is **`-0.9`**.

### Final prediction:
After considering the examples, the predicted property value for `ClCC` is approximately **`-1.0`**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends. The true value could vary depending on the specific property's dependence on structure.)
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.22067990038007376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**, property = 0.186) tend to have moderate property values, but highly chlorinated aliphatic chains (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl**, property = 1.400) have higher values.
   - Aromatic chlorination (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**, property = 1.128) also tends to increase the property value.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen in an aromatic ring (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**, property = -0.674) often have lower values unless balanced by other factors like chlorination.
   - The presence of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) in aromatic systems (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, property = 1.469) significantly increases the property value.

3. **Specific Case for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**:
   - This molecule has:
     - A chlorinated aromatic ring (**Clc1cccc(n1)**).
     - A trichloromethyl group (**C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) attached to the aromatic ring.
     - A nitrogen in the aromatic ring (pyridine-like structure), which might slightly reduce the property value compared to pure carbocyclic systems.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 1.469): This has two aromatic rings and a trichloromethyl group, yielding a high value.
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.128): This has two chlorinated aromatic rings but no trichloromethyl group.
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.960): Highly chlorinated aromatic with a nitro group, yielding a moderately high value.

Given that **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has:
- One chlorinated aromatic ring with nitrogen (slightly reducing effect).
- A trichloromethyl group (strongly increasing effect).

The nitrogen in the ring may offset some of the increase from the trichloromethyl group, but the overall effect should still be significantly positive. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (1.469) but higher than **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (1.128). 

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximate, likely in the range of 1.2 to 1.3). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (1.128) is a good benchmark, and adding the trichloromethyl group would likely push the value higher. 

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.35** (between 1.128 and 1.469, accounting for the nitrogen's slight reduction). 

Given the data, I would refine this to:  
**Final predicted property value: 1.30**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.) 

---  
**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is approximately **1.30**.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.2394052470733715
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (hexan-3-ol): Property value = **-0.94731798**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.51153642**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.06808492**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.06808492**

   Alcohols generally have negative property values, with primary alcohols (e.g., CCC(C)CCO) being less negative than secondary alcohols (e.g., CCCC(O)CCC). The presence of an aromatic ring (e.g., CC(O)c1ccccc1) seems to reduce the magnitude of the negative value.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or branching tend to slightly increase the property value (make it less negative). For example:
     - **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear secondary alcohol): -0.947
     - **CCC(C)CCO** (branched primary alcohol): -0.068

3. **Specific Case for 2-Hexanol (CCCCC(C)O)**:
   - This is a secondary alcohol like **CCCC(O)CCC**, but with a slightly branched structure (methyl group at the 2-position). 
   - Branching typically makes the property value less negative (as seen in **CCC(C)CCO** vs. linear alcohols).
   - However, the secondary alcohol effect (more negative than primary) dominates.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear secondary alcohol) has a value of **-0.947**, and branching tends to increase the value slightly, I predict that **CCCCC(C)O** (branched secondary alcohol) will have a property value slightly higher (less negative) than -0.947 but still more negative than primary alcohols like **CCC(C)CCO** (-0.068).

A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.8 and -0.9**. Averaging the trends, I predict:

**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O: -0.85**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.12331745596761041
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.87479412**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a biphenyl with chlorines) has a value of **0.87479412** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, suggesting symmetry matters).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (a chlorinated phenol) has a value of **-1.02501967**, indicating that adding an OH group significantly lowers the value.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, but the property values for similar structures (e.g., **ClCCl** vs. **ClC(Cl)Cl**) suggest that halogen type alone doesn't drastically change the value unless electronegativity or sterics play a role. 
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a value of **0.27127314**, but this is a simpler aliphatic iodide, so it's not directly comparable.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrically disubstituted aromatics (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) tend to have higher positive values compared to monosubstituted or asymmetrical analogs.
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is structurally analogous to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, just with bromine instead of chlorine.

4. **Bromine Effect**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but more polarizable. This could slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine due to enhanced dispersion forces or electronic effects.

### Prediction:
Given that **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **0.87479412**, and bromine is a heavier halogen with similar substitution patterns, the value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** should be **slightly higher** due to bromine's polarizability. 

However, the exact difference isn't clear from the examples, but a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.90 to 1.00**. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **0.92**. 

This is based on the similarity to 1,4-dichlorobenzene and the expectation that bromine's larger size slightly increases the property value.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.64461406104923
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a property value of **2.07852304**.
   - The given molecule is also a highly chlorinated biphenyl derivative, but with fewer chlorine atoms (5 chlorines) and a slightly different substitution pattern.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatic Trends**:
   - Increasing chlorination tends to increase the property value (e.g., compare **ClC(Br)Br** with -3.30039904 to the hexachlorinated example with 2.07852304).
   - The given molecule is less chlorinated than the hexachlorinated example but more chlorinated than simple chlorinated aliphatics (which have lower values).

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The given molecule is a dichlorobiphenyl with additional chlorines on both rings, but not as fully substituted as the hexachlorinated example. This suggests a value between the hexachlorinated case (2.078) and simpler chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** with -0.837).

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule is structurally similar to the hexachlorinated example but with fewer chlorines and a less symmetric substitution pattern. This would likely reduce the property value compared to 2.078 but keep it positive due to the aromatic and chlorinated nature.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is expected to be **positive but lower than 2.07852304**. A reasonable estimate would be around **1.5**, considering the degree of chlorination and aromaticity.

However, looking more closely at the substitution pattern:
- The given molecule has 5 chlorines (less than the hexachlorinated example) but still a significant number. 
- The biphenyl core with chlorines in multiple positions suggests a value closer to **1.2 to 1.6**.

After comparing with other examples (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** with 1.26373937, which is a polyaromatic hydrocarbon without chlorination), the chlorination here would likely increase the value slightly. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**1.45000000** (approximate, based on interpolation from the examples). 

For higher precision, if we note that the hexachlorinated case is 2.078 and the given molecule is less chlorinated but still heavily so, a value of **1.50** is plausible. 

### Final Answer:
**1.50000000** (estimated based on structural similarity and chlorination trends).

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 1.4089695424674549
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted with methyl groups and one with a phosphate group).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(OR)(OR))**: Highly polar and likely contributes positively to the property value.
3. **Methyl substitutions (C)**: Hydrophobic and may slightly decrease the property value.
4. **Bulky structure**: The molecule is large and has significant steric hindrance, which may influence the property.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., phosphate, nitro, or multiple halogens)** tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` = 1.128, `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 1.221).
- Molecules with **aromatic systems and moderate polarity** (e.g., `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 1.090) also have high values.
- The presence of **methyl groups** slightly reduces the property (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1` = -0.751 vs. `c1ccccc1` which would likely be less negative).

### Prediction:
This molecule has **two aromatic rings linked by a highly polar phosphate group**, similar to some of the higher-valued examples. However, the methyl groups may slightly offset this. Given the strong contribution from the phosphate and aromaticity, I predict a **property value in the range of 1.0 to 1.3**.

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 1.175**

This aligns with the trend observed for polar, aromatic, and sterically hindered molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.18044009975903036
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the aromatic ring. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`) tend to have positive property values (~1.024). CF3 is electron-withdrawing and often correlates with higher values.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The aromatic ring has a CF3 and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Similar structures (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) have negative values, but the CF3 may counteract this.
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: Chlorine substituents and a ketone in a ring. Chlorine-heavy molecules (e.g., `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl`) have high positive values (~1.734), but this is balanced by the nitrogen and ketone.
4. **Polar functional groups**: The ketone (=O) and amine (N) may lower the value slightly (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1` has -0.583).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (value: 1.024), which has CF3-like electron-withdrawing groups and chlorines.
- The presence of multiple chlorines and CF3 suggests a positive value, but the nitrogen and ketone might reduce it slightly.

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of strongly electron-withdrawing groups (CF3, Cl) and polar features (N, =O), the property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 0.85**  

This aligns with trends where halogen-rich and CF3-containing molecules tend toward higher values, but not as extreme as fully perchlorinated cases.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3014665659026723
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule contains a benzene ring with two substituents:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Electron-donating group (EDG).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Electron-withdrawing group (EWG).

2. **Similar examples from the given data**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): Property value = **-0.17056974**  
     (This has two strong EWGs, leading to a slightly negative value.)
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): Property value = **-0.04326442**  
     (This has an EDG, leading to a near-neutral value.)
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (furan-2-carbaldehyde): Property value = **0.23827645**  
     (This has an EWG on a heteroaromatic ring, leading to a slightly positive value.)

3. **Key observations**:
   - The nitro group is a strong EWG, which tends to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - The methoxy group is a moderate EDG, which tends to increase the property value (more positive).
   - The net effect will depend on the balance between these two groups.

### Prediction:
Given that the molecule has **one strong EWG (-NO2)** and **one moderate EDG (-OCH3)**, the property value is likely to be **slightly positive but closer to neutral** due to the competing effects. 

Looking at similar structures:
- The presence of **-NO2** alone (as in dinitrobenzene) gives a slightly negative value (-0.17).
- The presence of **-OCH3** alone (as in phenol) gives a near-neutral value (-0.04).
- The combination of both suggests a value **between -0.17 and 0.24**, likely closer to **0.0**.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is:  
**0.12** (slightly positive due to the balance of EDG and EWG effects).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)*

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.2472666181616545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (Hexachlorocyclohexane)**: Property value = **0.28743721**.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (Pentachlorophenol)**: Property value = **0.53676344**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1 (Chlorobenzene)**: Property value = **-6.12008973** (outlier, likely due to simplicity).
   - **ClCCCl (1,2-Dichloroethane)**: Property value = **-0.12392878**.

   The property tends to increase with the number of chlorine atoms, especially in rigid/sterically hindered systems.

2. **Steric and Structural Complexity**:
   - The given molecule is a **highly chlorinated polycyclic system** (likely a chlorinated norbornane or similar cage structure). Such systems often have higher property values due to steric and electronic effects.
   - Compare to **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 (a rigid bicyclic alcohol)**: Property value = **-1.96458771**, but this lacks chlorination.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - Chlorines are electron-withdrawing but also add steric bulk. In polycyclic systems, this can lead to positive property values (as seen in hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachlorophenol).

### Prediction for **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**:
- This is a **heavily chlorinated polycyclic alkane** (likely 8-10 chlorine atoms). 
- The steric congestion and high halogen count will dominate, similar to hexachlorocyclohexane but more extreme.
- Given that hexachlorocyclohexane has a value of **0.287** and pentachlorophenol has **0.537**, this molecule (with even more chlorines and rigidity) should have a **higher value**.

### Estimated Property Value:
**0.75 ± 0.15**  
*(Rationale: Between hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachlorophenol, but slightly higher due to additional chlorines and cage structure.)*

### Final Answer:
**0.72**  
*(This aligns with the trend for highly chlorinated, sterically hindered polycyclic systems.)*

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.5961404749810381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -NO₂, -Br, -Cl, -OH, -NH₂) tend to have more negative property values.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar groups (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings without electronegative substituents) tend to have less negative or positive values.

2. **Ester Group (-COO-)**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, property = -0.1025277) have moderately negative or near-zero values.
   - The presence of an ester group alone does not strongly push the value to extremes.

3. **Alkyl Chain Length**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCC#C**, property = -0.63855681) tend to have more negative values than shorter ones (e.g., **CCC#C**, property = 0.28827837).

4. **Specific Examples for Comparison**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (ester + ether + aromatic): 0.25520899.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ester + aromatic + amine): -0.1025277.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, not in the list but similar to propyl formate): Likely close to zero or slightly negative.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (Propyl Formate):
- It is a simple ester with a 3-carbon alkyl chain (**CCC**) and a formate group (**OC=O**).
- No strongly electronegative substituents (like -NO₂, -Cl, -OH) are present.
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property = -0.1025277), propyl formate lacks the aromatic ring and amine group, which likely reduces polarity further.
- The alkyl chain is longer than in **CCC#C** (property = 0.28827837), which might push the value slightly more negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely slightly negative but closer to zero due to the ester's moderate polarity and the alkyl chain's nonpolar contribution. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.15** (approximate, based on trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples' patterns. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property's definition.)

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.322612649218277
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with a value of **0.40885567**) tend to have moderately positive values. 
   - Shorter aliphatic chains (e.g., **CC** with **0.29092951**) also have positive but smaller values.
   - The presence of polar or functional groups can significantly alter the property.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** with **-0.70768004**) often have negative values, but this depends on the rest of the structure.
   - The molecule **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (an aldehyde) has a very negative value (**-2.7903965**), suggesting that carbonyls (especially aldehydes) may contribute to lower property values.

3. **Combination of Aliphatic and Polar Groups**:
   - The molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) with an ester group (**C(=O)OCC**). 
   - The aliphatic part would push the value toward the positive range (like **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**), but the ester group would likely reduce it (similar to other ester-containing molecules).

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (aldehyde) has **-2.7903965**.
   - **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde) has **-4.22546618**.
   - The ester in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is less polar than an aldehyde but still polar enough to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given the long aliphatic chain (hydrophobic, positive contribution) and the ester group (polar, negative contribution), the property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as aldehydes. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -1.0**. Comparing to similar molecules:
- **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (complex ester) has **-0.70768004**.
- **CC(C)I** (simple halogenated alkane) has **-0.67800967**.

Thus, for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, the predicted property value is approximately:  
**-0.65**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (estimated based on structural trends in the given data).

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.4430368461744305
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**: Present in many examples, often associated with negative property values (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1: -1.590**, **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -4.585**). However, when combined with other groups, the effect can vary.
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Chlorine is present in many molecules, with varying effects. For example:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O: -2.452** (strongly negative)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl: 1.068** (strongly positive)
   - The presence of multiple Cl atoms can increase hydrophobicity or polarity, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure.
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Seen in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2: 0.663** (positive contribution).
4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O: -2.452** (strongly negative) and **NNc1ccccc1: 0.332** (positive). The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and can reduce the property value unless balanced by other features.

### Key Observations:
- The molecule combines a phenol, amide, nitro group, and two chlorines. The nitro group and phenol might pull the value down, while the amide and chlorines could push it up.
- The closest analog in the examples is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2: 0.663**, which has a similar amide-phenol-chlorine motif but lacks the nitro group. The nitro group here likely reduces the value compared to this example.
- Another close analog is **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O: -2.452**, but our molecule has additional stabilizing features (amide, phenol) that would raise the value above this.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects:
- The nitro group and phenol suggest a value below 0.663 (from the amide-phenol-chlorine example).
- The amide and chlorines suggest a value above -2.452 (from the nitro-chlorine example).
- A reasonable compromise is **slightly positive**, similar to molecules with balanced polar/nonpolar features (e.g., **0.517** for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1**).

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.45** (moderately positive, balancing the nitro group's negative contribution with the amide and chlorines' positive effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 1.2310201569625476
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or heteroatoms (e.g., Cl, S, N, O, P). The property tends to increase with:
1. The presence of aromatic rings (especially with substitutions like Cl).
2. Heteroatoms (e.g., S, P, N) or polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, sulfonyl).
3. Molecular size and branching (though this is less consistent).

The molecule to predict is:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**: These are highly polar and contain sulfur and phosphorus, which likely increase the property value (similar to other S/P-containing molecules in the examples, e.g., COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a value of 0.71908789).
2. **Aromatic rings with sulfur linkage (Sc2ccc...)**: Thioether linkages (S) between aromatic rings are present, which may contribute positively (e.g., CCSSCC has a low value, but here the S is part of a larger conjugated system).
3. **Symmetry and size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, with two P(=S)(OC)OC groups and two aromatic rings linked by sulfur. Larger conjugated systems tend to have higher values (e.g., Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a high value of 1.64461406).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value = 0.71908789), which has one P(=S) group and a Cl-substituted aromatic ring. The new molecule has two P(=S) groups and a larger conjugated system, so the value should be higher.
- **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (value = 1.64461406) is a highly chlorinated, symmetric aromatic system, which is somewhat analogous in complexity.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of two P(=S) groups, aromaticity, and sulfur linkages, the property value should be **between 1.0 and 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:
**Predicted value: 1.25** (specific guess: 1.25000000). 

This is based on the molecule being more complex than COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 but less chlorinated/extreme than Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.05137674160768462
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tend to have negative property values unless balanced by other functional groups.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a property value of **-0.8375071** (nitro group on toluene).
   - Example: `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a positive value (**0.88941634**), but this is likely due to the presence of multiple electronegative substituents (Cl, O) and extended conjugation.

2. **Hydroxy Group (OH) on Aromatic Ring**:
   - Phenolic compounds (OH on benzene) often have moderate property values unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro).
   - Example: `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` has a value of **0.64038984** (amide + OH).
   - Example: `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **0.02920349** (OH + Cl substituents).

3. **Combination of OH and NO2**:
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is **2-nitrophenol**, where the nitro group is ortho to the hydroxy group. The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which can reduce the property value, but the OH can partially counteract this. 

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (aniline with Cl substituent): **-0.88313807** (electron-withdrawing Cl reduces value).
- `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrotoluene): **-0.8375071** (nitro group dominates).
- `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (amide + OH): **0.64038984** (positive due to amide and OH).

### Prediction:
The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both an OH (moderately electron-donating) and a nitro group (strongly electron-withdrawing). The nitro group's effect is likely stronger, but the OH mitigates it slightly compared to nitrotoluene. 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is between the value for nitrotoluene (-0.837) and the chloro-aniline (-0.883), but slightly less negative due to the OH. 

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, likely in the range -0.7 to -0.8). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (OH + Cl substituents): **0.02920349**, the nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than Cl, so the value should be more negative. 

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.65** (accounting for OH partial compensation). 

However, given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of NO2, the value might be closer to nitrotoluene (-0.837). 

### Final Prediction:
After balancing the effects, the predicted property value for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is:  
**-0.72** (intermediate between -0.65 and -0.837).

**Answer: -0.72**

Iteration: 78
SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 2.356164620242675
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a highly branched oligosaccharide with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (-O-), which contribute to its polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.

Breaking it down:
1. **Functional groups**: The molecule has numerous -OH groups (highly polar, hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors) and ether linkages (polar but no hydrogen-bond donation). This suggests significant hydrophilicity and potential for high solubility in water.
2. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, which typically increases complexity and could influence the property (e.g., boiling point, solubility, or a computed descriptor like logP or polar surface area).
3. **Comparison to examples**: 
   - Molecules with many -OH groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) have relatively high positive values (1.64116951). 
   - Less polar or smaller molecules (e.g., `CCC#N`) have lower values (0.37046729).
   - The presence of multiple -OH groups and ether linkages here is similar to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but with even greater size and branching.

Given this, the property value for `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` would likely be **higher than 1.64116951** (the value for the simpler sugar) due to its increased size and number of polar groups. 

**Predicted property value**: ~**1.8** (estimated based on the trend toward larger, more polar molecules having higher values in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the correlation between molecular features and the given values.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.28827836555422165
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne) in the context of the given data:

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The molecule **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a diyne with aromatic rings) has a property value of **-0.08489103**. This suggests that triple bonds (alkynes) do not strongly influence the property toward extreme values (close to zero in this case).
2. **Small hydrocarbons**: 
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone) has a value of **-0.02538202**.
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (an alcohol) has a value of **-0.94731798**.
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (a branched ketone) has a value of **-0.32695922**.
   - Simple alkanes/alkenes/alkynes without polar groups tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative.
3. **CCC#C** is a small, linear alkyne with no polar functional groups or conjugation. It is less polar than alcohols or ketones but more polar than pure alkanes due to the triple bond.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Alkynes like **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** have values close to zero.
- Small hydrocarbons without strong polar groups tend to have mildly negative or near-zero values.
- **CCC#C** lacks aromaticity or additional polar groups, so its value should be close to zero but slightly negative due to the weak polarity of the triple bond.

A reasonable estimate for **CCC#C** is:  
**-0.15** (slightly negative, similar in magnitude to small hydrocarbons with weak polar character).

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1.1542312014394858
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.71908789). This group often contributes positively to the property value due to its polarizable sulfur atom and potential for interactions.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions**: The **c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** fragment resembles heavily chlorinated aromatic systems like:
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.64461406)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.64461406)
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.28931086)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property = 1.06818018)
   
   Multiple chlorines increase the property value significantly due to their electron-withdrawing nature and contribution to molecular polarizability.

3. **Ethoxy groups (CCO)**: The **CCOP** and **Oc1cc...** fragments introduce flexibility and moderate polarity, but their effect is secondary compared to the P=S and Cl substitutions.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.71908789), which has a P=S group and a mono-chlorinated aromatic ring. Our target molecule has a P=S group and a tri-chlorinated aromatic ring, which would likely increase the property value further.
- The tri-chlorinated aromatic systems in the examples have values around **1.1–1.6**, depending on additional substituents.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The P=S group suggests a baseline near **0.7**.
- The tri-chlorinated aromatic ring pushes this higher, likely into the **1.0–1.3** range.
- The ethoxy groups may slightly temper the value compared to fully chlorinated systems like the hexachlorinated examples (1.64461406).

### Predicted Property:
Given these observations, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 1.15**  

This balances the contributions of the P=S group and the tri-chlorinated aromatic system while accounting for the moderating effect of the ethoxy substituents.

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 1.0102845974112975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative property values, especially with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂). 
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) often have more positive values (e.g., `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` has a high value of 1.175).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO₂, C=O) often decrease the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH₃, NH₂) can increase or decrease the value depending on context.
   - Amides (e.g., C(=O)N) and hydrazides (e.g., C(=O)NN) appear in molecules with mid-range values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has -0.280).

3. **Heterocycles**:
   - Pyridine-like nitrogen (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` has a value of -0.811).
   - The presence of multiple nitrogens or conjugated systems can lead to more positive values (e.g., `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` has 1.172).

4. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - Highly conjugated systems with polar groups (e.g., C=O, NO₂) tend to have less negative or positive values.
   - Aliphatic chains or non-conjugated systems have more negative values (e.g., `CCCCBr` has -1.882).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**
- **Structure**: Pyridine ring (6-membered aromatic with one nitrogen) substituted with a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN).
- **Features**:
  - The pyridine nitrogen is electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value.
  - The hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) is polar and conjugated with the ring, which could increase the value compared to simpler aromatic systems.
  - Similar molecules with C(=O)N or C(=O)NN groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` at -0.280) suggest mid-range values.

### Comparison with Closest Examples:
1. `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.883): Simple aromatic with electron-withdrawing Cl and NH₂.
2. `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (-0.280): Aromatic with amide and Cl substituents.
3. `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (1.172): Fused nitrogen heterocycle with C=O and NH groups.

The target molecule is less complex than fused systems but more polar than simple aromatics due to the hydrazide group. Its value likely lies between -0.5 and 0.5.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing pyridine nitrogen and the polar hydrazide group, the predicted value is:  
**-0.35** (mid-range negative, similar to amide-containing aromatics but slightly more negative due to the pyridine nitrogen). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.35**
==================================================
Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.6482807653540342
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as size, polarity, presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I), nitro groups (NO2), aromaticity, and functional groups like esters, amides, and sulfides. The property tends to be more positive for larger, more polarizable molecules with halogens or multiple aromatic rings, while smaller or less polar molecules tend to have more negative values.

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**  

### Key features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))** – This is a polar and bulky group, often contributing to higher property values (similar to sulfides or phosphates in the examples, which can have moderate to high values).
2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)** – Amides generally contribute positively to the property (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C has a high value of 0.775).
3. **Aliphatic chains (CCC, C1CCCCC1)** – These reduce the property value unless balanced by polar groups.
4. **Sulfur atoms (S)** – Sulfur-containing groups (e.g., CCS has 0.358) tend to increase the property.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** has a value of **-0.774**, but it includes a nitro group (which lowers the value in many cases).  
- **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.067**, with an amide and sulfide but also an aromatic ring.  
- **Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O** (value **1.561**) has multiple polar heterocycles and amides, which push the value higher.  

Given that our molecule has:
- A phosphorothioate group (bulky/polar, likely increasing the value),  
- An amide (increasing),  
- Aliphatic chains (decreasing),  
- No halogens or nitro groups (which would otherwise influence it strongly),  

I estimate the property to be **moderately positive**, likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.6**.  

### Final prediction:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.04359139073475705
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `C/C1CCCCC1\C` with a value of -0.70382971, `CCCCCCCO` with -0.95151566, `CCCC/C=C/C` with -0.88357311) tend to have negative property values, typically between -0.7 and -1.0.
   - Longer alkanes or more branched alkanes may have slightly less negative values (e.g., `CCCCCC1CCCC1` with 0.37176538 is cyclic and larger, which seems to increase the value).

2. **Functional groups**:
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers) often increase the property value (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` with 1.58240982, `CC(C)CO` with 0.5577125).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) and nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) can either increase or decrease the value depending on the context.

3. **Aromatic systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with substitutions can lead to positive or negative values, but simple unsubstituted aromatics (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) are not in the dataset, so we cannot directly compare.

### Prediction for `CCCCCCCC` (octane):
This is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or unsaturation. Based on the examples:
- `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a value of -0.95151566.
- `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (methylcyclohexane) has a value of -0.70382971.
- `CCCC/C=C/C` (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of -0.88357311.

Linear alkanes like octane (`CCCCCCCC`) are even less polarizable and have no functional groups, so we would expect a slightly more negative value than branched or cyclic alkanes. 

Given the trend, a reasonable prediction for `CCCCCCCC` is **approximately -1.0 to -1.2**. 

However, looking at `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol, -0.95151566), which is very similar but with an OH group (which would increase the value compared to pure alkane), we can infer that octane would likely be slightly more negative. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC` is:  
**-1.05** (approximate, based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. If the property is something like logP or polarizability, the reasoning might differ slightly.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -1.3234578215215413
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, carbonyl `C=O`, nitro `NO2`), aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity (e.g., ring systems, branching). The property values range from negative to positive, with highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., multiple `-OH` or `=O`) tending to increase the value, while nonpolar or less functionalized structures (e.g., alkanes, simple aromatics) tend to have lower or negative values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**SMILES:** `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`  
This is a steroid-like structure with the following features:
1. **Multiple rings (steroid backbone)**: Generally associated with mid-range values (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a value of **0.456**).
2. **Carbonyl group (`C=O`)**: Increases the property (as seen in other examples with `C=O`).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (`-OH`)**: Two `-OH` groups, which significantly increase the value (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has **1.766**, and `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` has **-0.820**, but the latter is offset by other features).
4. **Alkyne (`C#C`)**: Neutral to slightly positive contribution (no direct examples, but similar to alkenes like `C=C` with **0.452**).
5. **No highly polarizing groups (e.g., `NO2`, `F`, `Cl`)**: These are absent, so no large positive/negative spikes.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (value: **0.456**) is very similar but has one fewer `-OH` group.
- `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (value: **-0.820**) has more polar groups but also a `F` and `C(=O)CO`, which may complicate the trend.

Given the additional `-OH` in the target molecule (compared to the first example above), we expect a higher value, but not as extreme as polyols like `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`. The alkyne may slightly offset this.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.50**, considering:
- The steroid backbone with `C=O` and one `-OH` gives ~0.456.
- The second `-OH` could add ~0.1–0.2.
- The alkyne might subtract ~0.05.

**Final Prediction:** **0.55** (rounded from an estimated range of 0.50–0.60). 

This aligns with the trend where multi-functionalized steroids with polar groups have mid-to-high positive values.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.013054140792928923
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I'll analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Molecule Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
- **Aromatic rings**: Several benzene rings (e.g., `c1cc...`).
- **Ether linkages (O-alkyl groups)**: `COc`, `OC`, `OCO`.
- **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: `c1O`, `C(O)`.
- **Ketone (C=O)**: `C2=O`.
- **Fused ring systems**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings (e.g., `C6C2C...C7cc5OCOc5cc67`), similar to some of the polycyclic aromatic examples in the dataset.

### Comparison to Examples:
1. **Polycyclic Aromatic Systems**:
   - `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property: 1.2637) and `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` (property: 1.2342) are large polycyclic aromatic systems with no polar groups, yielding high property values (~1.2-1.3).
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., -OH, -OCH3) in the target molecule may reduce the property value compared to these purely aromatic systems.

2. **Oxygenated Aromatic Systems**:
   - `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (property: -1.2432) and `COc1ccccc1Cl` (property: -4.5856) show that adding -OCH3 and -Cl to a benzene ring significantly lowers the property value.
   - The target molecule has multiple -OCH3 and -OH groups, which would likely reduce the property value, but the polycyclic core may offset this somewhat.

3. **Complex Polycyclic + Polar Groups**:
   - `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (property: 1.1927) is a large polycyclic system with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-), yielding a high property value (~1.19). This is somewhat analogous to the target molecule.

4. **Fused Heterocycles**:
   - `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` (property: 1.0252) is a fused heterocycle with polar groups, yielding a moderate-high value (~1.03).

### Prediction:
The target molecule is a large polycyclic system with multiple ether (-O-) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The polycyclic core would tend to increase the property value (as seen in the examples with values ~1.2-1.3), but the polar groups would reduce it. Given the balance between these effects and the similarity to `C1C(O)CCC2...` (property: 1.1927), I predict a slightly lower value due to the additional polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.05** (approximate, likely between 1.0 and 1.2 based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The property could be something like logP, polarizability, or another molecular descriptor.)

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -1.2431579229263212
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can help estimate the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a property value of **0.05137674**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above, repeated) also has **0.05137674**.
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly listed but implied) would likely have a value close to these, though slightly lower due to the absence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a value of **-0.49556078**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has **0.87479412**.
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene) has **0.16187674**.
   - Chlorine substituents tend to slightly increase the property value compared to bare benzene, but the effect depends on other substituents.

3. **Hydroxy and Chloro Combined**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has both an electron-donating hydroxyl group (-OH) and an electron-withdrawing chlorine (-Cl) on the benzene ring. The hydroxyl group is a stronger donor than chlorine is a withdrawer, so the net effect is likely closer to phenol than chlorobenzene.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: +0.051 (nitro is strongly withdrawing, pulling the value up slightly).
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: -0.495 (iodo and chloro are both halogens, but no OH).
   - **Fc1ccccc1**: -0.669 (fluoro is more electronegative than chloro, but no OH).

### Prediction:
For **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, the hydroxyl group will dominate, pulling the value closer to phenol-like molecules, but the chlorine will slightly reduce the effect. Given that nitrophenol is +0.051 and chlorobenzene-like molecules are negative, a reasonable estimate is slightly below the nitrophenol value but above plain chlorobenzene.

**Predicted property value: -0.15** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar molecules).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at:
- Phenol-like: ~0.0 to +0.05 (nitrophenol).
- Chlorobenzene-like: ~-0.5 to -0.3.
- A weighted average considering -OH is stronger than -Cl suggests a value closer to 0 but slightly negative.

**Final predicted value: -0.10**. 

However, given the examples, a more precise interpolation suggests **-0.20** might be better. Given the variability, I would predict:

**Predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.25**. 

This balances the electron-donating -OH and electron-withdrawing -Cl effects. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.222498993319848
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Present at both ends (aliphatic Cl and aromatic Cl). From the examples, Cl-substituted aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` with 0.16187674) tend to have moderately positive values, while aliphatic Cl (e.g., `CCCCl` with -0.34668695) can lower the value.
   - **Alkyne group (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but triple bonds are generally polarizable and may increase the value slightly.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Similar to amides/carbamates. Examples like `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (0.09058966) and `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (-0.16956306) suggest this group can contribute modestly positively or negatively.
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` is similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (1.64461406), but with fewer Cl atoms, so less positive contribution.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar due to Cl, C#C, and OC(=O)N groups.
   - It is larger than simple aliphatics but smaller than highly substituted aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 1.77155333).

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (0.1804401): Has CF3, aromatic Cl, and amide-like groups; property is slightly positive.
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (0.16187674): Aromatic Cl substitution only.
   - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (-0.16956306): Contains carbamate and aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
The molecule has:
- Two Cl atoms (one aliphatic, one aromatic), which may cancel out (aliphatic Cl lowers, aromatic Cl raises).
- An alkyne (slight positive contribution).
- An ester-amide hybrid (likely modest contribution).
- No extreme features (e.g., multiple halogens or large conjugated systems).

Given these observations, the property value is likely **slightly positive but close to zero**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.12**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., 0.1804401 for the CF3/amide example, 0.16187674 for Cl-aromatic). The alkyne and aliphatic Cl may slightly reduce it compared to those.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.5739089633929013
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, which is a 2-pyridyl-like heterocycle with nitrogen atoms),
   - Another chlorinated phenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of **two aromatic rings** (both with Cl substituents), which often contribute to higher property values (e.g., see molecules with multiple aromatic rings like `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccccc13` with a high value of 0.852).
   - A **heterocycle (c2cncnc2)** with nitrogen atoms, which can increase the property value (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1` has a very high value of 1.119).
   - A **hydroxyl group (OH)**, which can slightly increase or decrease the value depending on context (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` has 0.233, while `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` has a very low -4.585 due to the methoxy + Cl combination).
   - **Chlorine substituents** on both phenyl rings, which can increase the value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has 1.469).

3. **Comparable Examples**:
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (1.469): Similar chlorinated aromatic systems with a central carbon.
   - `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (1.119): High value due to nitrogen-rich heterocycle.
   - `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccccc13` (0.852): High value due to fused aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two chlorinated aromatic rings,
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle,
- A hydroxyl group (which may slightly reduce the effect of the other features),

the property value is likely **high**, but not as extreme as the most nitrogen-rich or heavily chlorinated examples. 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.95**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.95** (likely between 0.9 and 1.1 based on structural similarity to high-value examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.3415933396788901
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbonyl-containing compounds (C=O)**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (ethyl acetoacetate): -0.550 (moderately negative)
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): 0.0017 (near zero)
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal): -0.556 (moderately negative)
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (furan-2-carbaldehyde): 0.238 (slightly positive)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)C** (N,N-dimethylacetamide): 0.839 (strongly positive)

   The property seems to depend on the carbonyl environment. Esters (e.g., ethyl acetate) tend to have values near zero, while aldehydes (e.g., heptanal) are more negative. Amides (e.g., dimethylacetamide) are strongly positive.

2. **Ether-containing compounds (C-O-C)**:
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1**: -0.264 (slightly negative)
   - **CC(=O)OCC**: 0.0017 (near zero)
   - **CCCOC(=O)C**: Not directly present, but esters with ether-like fragments are near zero.

3. **Alkyl chain length**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCBr**: -1.882) can lead to more negative values, but this is not consistent across all examples.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal): -0.556, while **CC=O** (acetaldehyde, not present) would likely be less negative.

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate):
- This is an ester (formate ester) with a butyl group and a formyl (C=O) group.
- Similar to **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, property = 0.0017), but with a longer alkyl chain (butyl instead of ethyl).
- Longer alkyl chains may slightly decrease the property (as seen in **CCCCBr** vs. smaller halides), but esters seem less affected.
- Formate esters (HCOOR) might behave similarly to other esters, but the smaller formyl group could introduce slight variability.

### Predicted Property:
Given that ethyl acetate has a value near zero (0.0017) and butyl formate is structurally similar but with a longer chain, I predict a slightly more negative value due to the longer alkyl group. However, the ester functionality typically keeps the value close to zero. 

**Predicted property for CCCCOC=O: ~ -0.15**

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For higher accuracy, statistical modeling or more data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.07541612524712053
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in how certain structural features influence the property value. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the training data:

### Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **-0.12392878**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.9961826**, indicating that multiple chlorines on an aromatic ring increase the property value significantly.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4-chloroaniline) has a property value of **-0.88313807**, showing that a single chlorine on an aromatic ring with an electron-donating group (NH2) decreases the property value.
   - **CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (a chloro-substituted aromatic amide) has a low value of **0.01858302**.

2. **Small Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a value of **-0.12392878**, which is slightly negative.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is even smaller (just two chlorines on a single carbon), so we might expect a similar or slightly more negative value.

3. **General Trends**:
   - Aliphatic chlorinated compounds tend to have moderately negative or near-zero values unless heavily chlorinated (e.g., hexachlorobenzene is an outlier due to aromaticity and multiple chlorines).
   - The presence of other functional groups (e.g., Br, O, N) can further modulate the property value.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- **ClCCl** is structurally simpler than **ClCCCl** (fewer carbons, same number of chlorines), so its property value should be in a similar range but slightly more negative due to reduced size and lack of additional carbon backbone.
- The value for **ClCCCl** is **-0.12392878**, so **ClCCl** would likely be slightly more negative but still close to this range.

### Final Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for the property value of **ClCCl** is:

**-0.15** (slightly more negative than ClCCCl but in the same general range). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the trends in the provided data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -1.1226690853760035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH groups tend to have property values in the range of **0.1 to 0.3** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has **0.23359206**, `CC(C)C(C)O` has **0.29326304**).
   - However, if the -OH is part of a more complex or polar structure, the value may vary (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has **1.8306577**, but this is an extreme case due to multiple -OH groups).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with simple alkyl or hydroxyl groups often have property values around **0.1 to 0.3** (e.g., `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has **0.14916189**, `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` has **-0.00278747**).

3. **Methyl Groups (-CH3)**:
   - Methyl groups on aromatic rings do not drastically change the property value unless combined with other functional groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(C)cc1O` has **-0.72168322**, but this also has a bulky tert-butyl-like structure).

4. **Specific Similar Example**:
   - The molecule `Cc1ccc(C)cc1O` (which is very similar to `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` but with para-substitution) has a property value of **-0.72168322**. However, this may be influenced by sterics or other factors.
   - The molecule `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (similar but with an isopropyl group) also has **-0.72168322**, suggesting that the hydroxyl + methyl substitution on an aromatic ring tends toward slightly negative values.

### Prediction for `Cc1cccc(C)c1O`:
- This molecule is **2-methylphenol** (o-cresol), with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.
- Compared to `Cc1ccc(C)cc1O` (p-cresol, property = **-0.72168322**), the ortho substitution in `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` may introduce slight steric or electronic differences, but the overall impact on the property is likely similar.
- Given the examples, we can expect a value in the range of **-0.5 to -0.8**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is approximately **-0.65**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The property could be related to logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend suggests a slightly negative value for this structure.)
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.3305898007997479
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the property being predicted is related to the **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`) tend to have **higher positive logP values** (e.g., 1.49962534), indicating increased hydrophobicity due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.
2. **Polar or nitrogen/oxygen-rich molecules** (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1`) also have **positive logP but less extreme**, while some polar nitro/amine groups can reduce logP (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has -2.45235544).
3. **Symmetry and additional aromatic rings** increase logP (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24` has 1.06872571).

### Target Molecule:
`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`  
- This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with **5 chlorine atoms** and **two aromatic rings**.  
- Comparing to similar molecules:  
  - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (5 Cl, 2 rings) has **logP = 1.49962534**.  
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (6 Cl, 2 rings) has **logP = 1.64461406**.  

The target molecule has **one fewer chlorine** than the second example but the same biphenyl core. Thus, its logP should be **slightly lower than 1.64461406 but higher than 1.49962534**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.55** (estimated based on interpolation between the two closest examples).  

*(Note: Without a clear mathematical model, this is a qualitative estimate. For precise predictions, computational tools like RDKit or quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models would be needed.)*

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1.0149640211971238
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a property value of **0.4847784**.
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane) has a property value of **0.04359139**.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isoprene), similar to nonene but with branching and a shorter chain.

2. **Branched Alkanes/Alkenes**:
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a property value of **0.13999484**.
   - Branching tends to slightly lower the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., octane vs. branched alkanes).

3. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate) has a high value (**0.71794895**), but this includes an ester group, which complicates direct comparison.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a pure hydrocarbon with no polar groups, so its value should be closer to other simple alkenes or branched alkanes.

4. **Other Examples**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde) has a very low value (**-2.7903965**), but this is likely due to the polar aldehyde group, which is not present in **CC=C(C)C**.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- The molecule is a branched alkene with no polar groups. 
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene): **0.4847784**.
  - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): **0.13999484**.
- Branching typically reduces the property value slightly compared to linear chains, but the double bond may increase it slightly.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **0.1 and 0.3**, closer to the branched alkane but slightly higher due to the double bond.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CC=C(C)C** is approximately **0.25**. 

**Answer: 0.25**

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.07541612524712053
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) by analyzing trends in the data. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)`, `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.884, 1.247). 
   - However, simpler chlorinated molecules like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) have a negative value (-0.306).

2. **Size and Complexity**: 
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., polycyclic, long chains, or multiple functional groups) tend to have higher (more positive) property values. 
   - Smaller, simpler molecules (e.g., `C=CCCC=C`, `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`) tend to have negative values.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a very small, simple molecule with two chlorines. 
   - It lacks the complexity or size seen in molecules with high positive values. 
   - Similar small chlorinated molecules (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`) have negative values.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **ClCCl** and the trend for small chlorinated molecules to have negative property values, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate, considering the closest analog (`ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` with -0.306), is:  
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.75**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.029203489184442787
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property value of **0.02920349**.
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** has a property value of **0.51717232**.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is structurally similar to **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, but with a slightly different substitution pattern (two chlorines adjacent vs. one chlorine shifted).

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: 
   - Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings are electron-withdrawing, which can influence the property value. The more chlorines, the higher the property value tends to be (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** has a high value of 0.517).
   - The presence of an oxygen (hydroxyl group) can also influence the property, often lowering it compared to fully halogenated aromatics.

3. **Comparison to Given Example**:
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.02920349) has two chlorines adjacent and one opposite the hydroxyl group.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** has two chlorines adjacent and one shifted, which is a very similar substitution pattern but slightly less symmetric. This might lead to a small increase in the property value due to reduced symmetry.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.02920349) and the slightly less symmetric substitution in **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, I predict a modest increase in the property value. 

**Predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl: ~0.05** (slightly higher than 0.02920349 but not as high as heavily halogenated examples like the brominated case). 

However, looking back at **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.02920349) and considering that **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is almost identical in substitution (just one chlorine shifted), the difference might be negligible. Thus, a more conservative estimate would be very close to the given example.

**Final predicted value: 0.03** (approximately the same as the closely related example). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.013054140792928923
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: These are present in the examples, e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (property = -3.97676625) and `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.05137674). The presence of multiple polar groups (OCH₃, OH) suggests a moderate to high polarity, but the exact effect depends on their arrangement.
2. **Sugar-like moieties (tetrahydrofuran and pyran rings with multiple -OH groups)**: Examples like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 2.10320098) and `OCC(O)CO` (property = 1.43124154) show that polyhydroxylated structures tend to have higher property values (positive, >1). This suggests a significant positive contribution.
3. **Lactone (cyclic ester) group**: The `COC2=O` (cyclic ester) is somewhat similar to carbonyls in the examples, but its exact effect is harder to pin down. Carbonyls in the examples vary in their contributions (e.g., `C#C` has 0.76601037, while `CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C` has -0.9521468).
4. **Fused polycyclic system**: The molecule has a fused ring system similar to some aromatic examples, e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` (property = 1.42741621), which has a high positive value. This suggests a positive contribution.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The sugar-like portions (with multiple -OH groups) are most similar to the examples with high positive values (~1.4 to 2.1).
- The aromatic portions with -OCH₃ and -OH are somewhat similar to `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.05137674), but the additional complexity and fused rings likely increase the value.
- The lactone and fused system add complexity, but the overall trend from the examples suggests that polyhydroxylated and fused systems have higher values.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of polyhydroxylated sugar-like moieties and the fused aromatic system, the property value is likely in the higher positive range, similar to `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (2.10320098) or `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` (1.42741621). However, the presence of methoxy groups and the lactone might slightly reduce this.

**Predicted property value: 1.75** (a balance between the high values of polyhydroxylated sugars and the moderate values of substituted aromatics).

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7044814712288847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like fragment** (with N and C=O groups). This is somewhat similar to the structure **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C**, which has a property value of **0.29124095**.
   - Both molecules have:
     - A heterocyclic ring with N and S/O.
     - A bulky **C(C)(C)C** (tert-butyl) group.
     - Polar groups (C=O, N-H).

2. **Polarity and Substituents**:
   - The **C=O** and **N-H** groups increase polarity (may raise the property value).
   - The **tert-butyl group** is hydrophobic (may slightly lower the property value).
   - The **thioether (S-CH3)** group is moderately polar but less polar than an oxygen analog.

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = **1.01970429**): This has a similar pyrimidine-like structure but lacks the bulky tert-butyl group and thioether. Its higher value may be due to the absence of bulky hydrophobic groups.
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = **0.29124095**): This is structurally closer, with a tert-butyl group and polar heterocycle. The presence of S and O/N groups balances polarity and bulkiness.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar groups (C=O, N-H, S-CH3) and hydrophobic bulk (tert-butyl), the property value is likely **slightly higher than 0.29124095** (from the closest analog) but lower than **1.01970429** (due to the tert-butyl group reducing polarity). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45 ± 0.15**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the examples, molecules with:
- Tert-butyl groups tend to have values in the **0.2–0.8** range.
- Thioethers (S-R) are present in **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (0.291) and **CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1** (0.180), but the latter is less polar.
- The C=O and N-H here add polarity, pushing the value higher than 0.291 but not as high as 1.019.

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.52**

### Final Answer:
**0.52**

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7477119363392154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Benzene rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) often contribute moderately positive or negative values depending on substituents. 
   - Example: `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has a value of **0.08202611**, while `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrotoluene) has **-0.8375071**, indicating electron-withdrawing groups reduce the property.

2. **Esters (`C(=O)OR`)**:
   - Esters tend to have negative values. For example:
     - `CCCC(=O)OC` (butyl acetate): **-0.51119474**
     - `CCCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl pentanoate): **-0.51119474** (same as above, suggesting chain length doesn't drastically change the value).
   - The molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is **ethyl benzoate**, which combines an ester with a benzene ring.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether): **0.14916189** (moderately positive due to two aromatic rings).
   - `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a benzofuranone derivative): **-1.13159875** (highly negative due to carbonyls).

4. **Ethyl Benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)**:
   - The ester group (`C(=O)OC`) is electron-withdrawing, likely reducing the property.
   - The benzene ring may partially offset this, but the ester dominates.

### Prediction:
Given the consistent negative values for esters (around **-0.5**) and the slight positive contribution from the benzene ring, the property for **ethyl benzoate** is likely **between -0.4 and -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.51** (similar to the other ester examples like `CCCC(=O)OC`).

### Final Answer:
**-0.51** (approximate).
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.028498883904885614
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Chains and Halogens**:
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (4-heptanone): -1.7266122  
     (This is a ketone with a 7-carbon chain, but the presence of the carbonyl group likely lowers the property value significantly.)
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol): -0.95151566  
     (An 8-carbon chain with a polar -OH group, giving a moderately negative value.)
   - **CI** (methyl iodide): 0.27127314  
     (A simple alkyl halide with a small carbon chain and iodine, giving a slightly positive value.)
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): 0.25399859  
     (Aromatic system with a bromine, giving a slightly positive value.)

2. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - Bromine tends to contribute a slightly positive or neutral effect on the property value, as seen in **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (0.25399859) and **CI** (0.27127314).

3. **Long Alkyl Chains**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (without polar groups) tend to have negative property values, e.g., **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): -0.20703802.  
   - The presence of halogens can offset this slightly.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a 7-carbon alkyl chain with a terminal bromine.  
- Compared to **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol, -0.95151566), the bromine is less polar than -OH but still adds some positive contribution.  
- Compared to **CI** (0.27127314), the longer alkyl chain will pull the value down.  
- The closest analog is **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene, -0.20703802), but bromine is more polar than a double bond, so the value should be slightly higher.  

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than pure hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (between -0.95151566 for 1-octanol and -0.20703802 for 1-octene, adjusted for bromine's effect).

However, looking at **CI** (0.27127314) and the alkyl chain effect, another plausible estimate is **-0.25** (since bromine's effect is partially canceled by the long chain).  

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.35** (similar in magnitude to **CSSC** (-0.33540842), as both have a long chain and a heteroatom (S or Br)).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **-0.35**.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.039357704477799
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, and functional group contributions. Let's analyze the molecule **CO (methanol)** in this context:

1. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: Methanol (CO) is a small, polar molecule with a hydroxyl group (-OH) that can form strong hydrogen bonds. This is similar to molecules like **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O** (property = 1.76559448) and **NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O** (property = 1.55400851), which also have multiple hydrogen-bonding groups and high property values. However, methanol has only one -OH group, so its value should be lower than these.

2. **Small Aliphatic Alcohols**: Compare to **CCC(C)CO** (property = 0.29201915), which is a larger alcohol but less polar due to the longer hydrocarbon chain. Methanol is smaller and more polar, so its property value should be higher than this.

3. **Other Small Polar Molecules**: **NC(N)=NC#N** (property = 1.32126208) is a small, highly polar molecule with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites, similar to methanol but with more functional groups. Methanol's value should be slightly lower.

4. **Contrast with Nonpolar Molecules**: Nonpolar molecules like **CCC** (property = -0.06963563) or **CC1=CCCCC1** (property = -1.8004077) have negative or low property values, whereas methanol is polar and should have a positive value.

### Prediction:
Given these observations, methanol (CO) should have a property value between **0.5 and 1.0**, leaning toward the higher end due to its strong hydrogen-bonding capability but lower than molecules with multiple polar groups. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CO: 0.75** (specific value could vary slightly, but this is a plausible range based on the examples). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **NC(=O)N** (urea, property = 1.23759815) is a small polar molecule with two -NH groups, while methanol has one -OH group. Thus, methanol's value should be lower than urea but higher than **CCC(C)CO** (0.29201915). 

A refined estimate:  
**Predicted property value for CO: ~0.65** (to reflect its intermediate polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability). 

Given the variability in the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for CO: 0.70** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the provided data). 

### Final Answer:
**0.70**
