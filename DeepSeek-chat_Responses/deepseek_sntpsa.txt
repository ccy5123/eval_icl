SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with different molecular structures. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, let's analyze its features:

1. **Long aliphatic chain (`CCCCCCCC`)**: Similar to `CCCCCC` and `CCCCCCCC`, which have a property value of 0.0 when no other functional groups are present.
2. **Ester group (`CC(=O)OC`)**: This is similar to molecules like `CC(C)COC(=O)C` and `CCOC(=O)CC`, which have a property value of **0.67449076**.

Given that the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` contains an ester group (`CC(=O)OC`) at the end of a long aliphatic chain, the dominant contributor to the property value is likely the ester functionality, as seen in the examples. The long aliphatic chain itself does not appear to significantly influence the property when other functional groups are present (e.g., `CCCCCC(=O)C` has a value of -0.3843269, but the ester group seems to override this).

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is:

**0.67449076** (same as other ester-containing molecules in the examples).

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.7529380065585458
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br)**:
   - Molecules with only halogens (e.g., ClC=C, BrC(Cl)Cl, ClCC) typically have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups dominate.
   - Halogens combined with other functional groups (e.g., Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl) can result in non-zero values, but the property is often overridden by other features.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC) often have a property value of **0.66312565**.
   - If the carbonyl is part of a cyclic amide (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1), the value is the same (0.66312565).

3. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen and Oxygen**:
   - Molecules like **c1cncnc1** (a nitrogen-containing heterocycle) have a value of **0.47317726**.
   - The target molecule contains a heterocycle with nitrogen and oxygen (benzofuran-2-one-like structure with NH and C=O), which is somewhat similar to **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = **1.67064852**), but less complex.

4. **Hydroxy Groups (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH (e.g., CCC(O)CC, CO) typically have a value of **-0.83939914**, but this is overridden if other dominant groups (e.g., carbonyls) are present.

5. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems (e.g., c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2) with no other strong functional groups often have a value of **0.0** or **-0.83939914** if -OH is present.

### Target Molecule: **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**
- **Structure**: A chlorinated benzofuran-2-one derivative with:
  - Aromatic ring with Cl substituent (tends toward 0.0).
  - Lactam-like cyclic structure with C=O and NH (similar to cyclic amides, which give ~0.66312565).
  - Oxygen in the heterocycle (no strong effect unless combined with other features).
- **Analogous Examples**:
  - **O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1** (property = 0.66312565): Similar cyclic carbonyl + NH motif.
  - **c1cncnc1** (property = 0.47317726): Less similar, but shows nitrogen heterocycles can elevate the value.
  - **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 1.67064852): More complex, but shares the cyclic C=O + NH motif.

### Prediction:
The target molecule's cyclic carbonyl + NH group is the dominant feature, similar to the examples with property **0.66312565**. The chlorine substituent does not significantly alter this (as seen in other halogenated examples with carbonyls). Thus, the predicted value is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.66312565**
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7237793359215606
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** tend to have higher positive property values when attached to organic frameworks:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of **2.1858011**
   - `CCN2c1nc(C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` has a value of **2.11792978**

2. The property value seems to be influenced by the presence of nitro groups, especially when they are directly attached to aliphatic or aromatic carbons.

3. The molecule `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is an aliphatic nitro compound (specifically, **2-nitropropane**). Given the examples, nitro groups in such contexts contribute significantly to the property value.

4. Comparing with similar nitro-containing molecules:
   - The nitro group in `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (value = **2.1858011**) is attached to a heterocyclic ring, while in `CC(C)N(=O)=O`, it is attached to a simpler aliphatic chain. This might slightly reduce the property value compared to the heterocyclic case but still keep it in a similar range.

5. The absence of other strongly polar or functional groups (like halogens, which often reduce the property value to 0 or negative) suggests the value will be positive and moderately high.

### Predicted Property Value for `CC(C)N(=O)=O`:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value is likely close to the other nitro-containing examples, specifically around **2.1**. 

**Final Prediction: 2.10455951**  
(This matches the value seen in other aliphatic nitro-like structures in the dataset, such as `CCCOCC` and `c1(OC)ccc(CC=C)cc1`, which also have values of 2.10455951, suggesting a possible default or common value for such functional groups.)

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.4044234601683172
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some observed trends:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, cycloalkanes, or aromatic systems without polar substituents)** tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `CC(C)C(C)(C)C`, `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`).

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, nitro, amino, halogens, etc.)** tend to have non-zero values, often positive or negative depending on the nature of the substituents.

3. **Steroids or polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` has a value of **2.04441581**).

4. **Molecules with multiple polar or conjugated systems** (e.g., nitro groups, extended aromatic systems with heteroatoms) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `CCC(C)c1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O` has **2.17145418**).

5. **Molecules with ethers, esters, or amides** can have moderate positive or negative values depending on the context.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
```
This is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with the following features:
- A hydroxyl group (`OH`).
- A carbonyl group (`C=O`).
- A hydroxymethyl group (`CH2OH`).
- Multiple fused rings (steroid backbone).

Given the examples, similar steroid-like structures with carbonyl groups (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`) have high positive values (~2.0). The presence of additional polar groups (`OH`, `CH2OH`) may further influence the property, likely increasing it slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarity to `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (which has a value of **2.04441581**) and the additional polar groups, the predicted value for this molecule would be slightly higher.

**Final Prediction: ~2.15** (similar to other steroid-like structures with polar substituents in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 2.1082515348128177
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), connected by a urea-like linker **C(=O)NC(=O)N**.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Fluorine atoms on one ring (**Fc1cccc(F)c1**).
   - Chlorine atom on the other ring (**c2ccc(Cl)cc2**).
   - The linker includes two amide-like (**C=O**) groups and a central nitrogen.

### Observations from Given Examples:
- **Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br, F)**: 
  - Examples like **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**, and **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** all have a property value of **0.0** unless they include additional functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl).
- **Amide/urea-like groups**: 
  - **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** has a value of **0.86803447**.
  - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has a value of **2.1443262**.
  - The presence of **C=O** and **N** in the linker suggests some polarity/hydrogen bonding potential, which may increase the property value compared to simple halogenated aromatics.
- **Combination of halogens and polar groups**: 
  - The molecule is more complex than simple halogenated aromatics but lacks strongly polar groups like hydroxyl (**OH**) or nitro (**NO2**), which are associated with higher values in the examples (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has **-0.83939914**, but this includes **OH**).

### Prediction:
The molecule has:
- Two halogenated aromatic rings (tending toward **0.0**).
- A polar urea-like linker (tending toward **~0.8–2.1**, depending on exact structure).
- No strongly electron-donating or withdrawing groups beyond halogens and the linker.

Given the examples, the linker's polarity is likely to dominate over the halogens, but not as strongly as in cases with **OH** or **NO2**. A reasonable estimate is close to **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (0.86803447)** or slightly higher due to the additional **C=O** group.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.0** (approximate, likely between 0.8 and 1.2 based on similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 2.1045595084625406
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify several patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes and halogenated compounds tend to have property values of 0.0 (e.g., CCCC1CCCC1, ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl, CCSCC)
2. Alcohols (-OH groups) typically have property values around -0.83939914 (e.g., CCCC(C)(O)CC, CCCCCCO, CC(C)CC(C)(C)O)
3. Ethers (C-O-C) seem to follow the alcohol pattern when they're in simple chains
4. More complex structures with multiple functional groups show higher or intermediate values

The molecule in question is CCCOC(C)C, which is:
- An ether (propyl isopropyl ether)
- A relatively simple aliphatic compound
- Similar to other simple oxygen-containing compounds in the dataset

Looking at comparable compounds:
- CCCC(C)CO (2-methyl-1-pentanol): -0.83939914
- CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol): -0.83939914
- CCOC(=O)CC (ethyl propionate): 0.67449076 (but this is an ester, not an ether)

The most similar compounds are the simple alcohols, and since this is a simple ether with similar chain lengths, I would predict it follows the same pattern as the simple alcohols.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is: -0.83939914

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1.9812179053932972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is present in other molecules with non-zero property values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of 1.67064852).
   - It has a **diketopiperazine-like core** (two carbonyl groups attached to a nitrogen-containing ring), which is a polar and potentially bioactive motif.
   - The presence of **alkyl groups (CCC(C))** may reduce polarity slightly but not enough to nullify the effect of the polar core and bromine.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Br, Cl)** and polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitrogens) tend to have property values > 0. For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (fully chlorinated biphenyl) has 0.0, but this is likely due to symmetry and lack of polar groups.
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (bromine + amide) has 1.67064852.
     - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (polycyclic aromatic with nitrogen) has 0.56586262.
   - The diketopiperazine-like structure here is more polar than simple aromatics but less polar than some of the highly functionalized examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` with 1.87506867).

3. **Expected Value**:
   - Given the **bromine substituent** and the **polar carbonyl/nitrogen core**, the property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**.
   - A reasonable estimate is **~0.8**, similar to `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (0.56586262) but higher due to the bromine and additional carbonyl groups.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.79839261**  
*(This matches the value of `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1`, which has similar halogen and nitrogenous features.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (which is biphenyl, a molecule consisting of two benzene rings connected by a single bond), we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCCCCC`, `C1CCc2ccccc2C1`, `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. These are non-polar, symmetric, or lack functional groups that might contribute to the property in question.

2. **Aromatic systems without polar functional groups** (e.g., `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) also have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that the property is likely related to polarity, hydrogen bonding, or other interactions involving functional groups.

3. The target molecule, **biphenyl (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`)**, is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with no polar or functionalized groups. It is analogous to the examples above that have a value of **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property value for the molecule `CCCCS` (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol). 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - Molecules like `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` (bicyclohexane), `Brc1cccc2ccccc12` (brominated biphenyl), `CC(C)I` (iodinated alkane), and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) have a property value of **0.0**. These are generally inert or non-polar structures.
   - `CCCC(=C)C` (branched alkene) and `CCC1CCCCC1` (cyclohexane with propyl) also have **0.0**.

2. **Polar or Functionalized Aliphatic Compounds**:
   - `CC(O)C(C)(C)C` (tertiary alcohol) has **-0.83939914**.
   - `CC1CO1` (epoxide) has **1.24992438**, suggesting that small polar rings or strained systems may have higher values.
   - `CCNC(=S)NCC` (thiourea derivative) has **-0.14822491**, indicating that sulfur-containing polar groups can slightly reduce the property value.

3. **Sulfur-Containing Compounds**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` (phosphorodithioate) has **2.13034186**, but this is a complex, highly polar molecule.
   - `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` (thioamide) has **-0.11855098**, suggesting that simple sulfur-containing groups may not significantly increase the property value unless combined with other polar features.

### Prediction for `CCCCS`:
- `CCCCS` is a simple aliphatic thiol (1-butanethiol). It has a polar -SH group, but the rest of the molecule is a non-polar butyl chain.
- Compared to `CCNC(=S)NCC` (thiourea derivative, **-0.14822491**), the thiol is less polar and lacks additional functional groups.
- Compared to `CC(O)C(C)(C)C` (alcohol, **-0.83939914**), the thiol is somewhat similar in polarity but sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the effect may be less pronounced.
- Simple aliphatic chains with halogens or no polar groups have **0.0**, so the thiol group might slightly reduce the value.

Given these observations, the property value for `CCCCS` is likely close to **0.0** but slightly negative due to the thiol group. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.1** (approximate, likely in the range -0.2 to 0.0). 

However, since none of the examples with simple thiols are provided, and most simple aliphatic structures default to **0.0**, the safest prediction is:

**Final predicted property value: 0.0** (with the understanding that the actual value might be slightly negative if the training data includes such trends). 

Given the examples, the model seems to assign **0.0** unless there are strong polar or conjugated features, so **0.0** is the most consistent prediction.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and patterns observed in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values, I can predict the property for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** as follows:

### Observations:
1. **Presence of hydroxyl group (-OH)**: 
   - Molecules with a hydroxyl group attached to an aliphatic chain or ring often have property values around **-0.83939914** (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC`, `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `CC(C)CC(C)O`).
   - The hydroxyl group seems to consistently correlate with this value when other functional groups or halogens are not present to override it.

2. **Branched aliphatic chains**: 
   - Simple branched aliphatic chains without polar or functional groups (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C`, `CC(C)C`) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - However, when combined with -OH, the value shifts to **-0.83939914**.

3. **No conflicting functional groups**: 
   - The molecule `CCCC(C)(C)CO` has no halogens, aromatic rings, or other polar groups (like nitro, carbonyl, etc.) that would override the hydroxyl group's influence.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched aliphatic alcohol, structurally similar to the examples with `-OH` and aliphatic branching (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC`). Thus, its predicted property value is:

**-0.83939914**
==================================================
Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., c1ccccc1, Cc1cccc(C)c1C, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1) consistently have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with nitro groups (O=N(=O)...) tend to have negative values around -0.72.

3. Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) in certain contexts have negative values around -0.38 to -0.84.

4. More complex polycyclic structures with multiple functional groups can have positive values, especially when they contain multiple oxygen-containing functional groups or complex ring systems.

The molecule in question is: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1

This is a simple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (methyl-substituted naphthalene) with no polar functional groups. Based on the examples:

- All simple hydrocarbons (including polycyclic ones like Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 and C1Cc2ccccc2C1) have property values of 0.0.
- There are no polar functional groups (like NO2, C=O, OH, etc.) that would contribute to a non-zero value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is: 0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.6631256504385672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.66312565**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The given molecule has **C(C)CCC** and **CC=C** substituents on the hydantoin ring, while the example has **C** (methyl) and **CC=C** (allyl) groups.
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is a branched alkyl chain (isopentyl-like), which is more hydrophobic and bulky than a simple methyl group but less polar.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The presence of the **CC=C** (allyl) group is shared with the example molecule (property = 0.66312565).
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is somewhat similar to other branched alkyl chains in the dataset (e.g., **CC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, which have property = -0.83939914), but these also contain polar hydroxyl groups, which significantly lower the property value.
   - The hydantoin core is polar and likely contributes positively to the property value, as seen in the example (0.66312565).

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The property value seems to be influenced by:
     - **Polarity**: The hydantoin core is polar, increasing the value.
     - **Hydrophobicity**: Alkyl groups (like C(C)CCC) tend to reduce the value unless balanced by polar features.
     - **Conjugation/Unsaturation**: The **CC=C** group may slightly increase the value due to mild electron delocalization effects.

5. **Prediction**:
   - The given molecule is very similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = 0.66312565), but with a slightly larger hydrophobic substituent (**C(C)CCC** instead of **C**). This would likely reduce the property value slightly, but not drastically (since the core dominates).
   - A reasonable estimate would be **slightly lower than 0.66312565**, perhaps in the range of **0.5 to 0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the similarities and adjustments for the substituents, the predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is:

**0.58** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

This is slightly lower than the example with the methyl group (0.66312565) due to the increased hydrophobicity of the **C(C)CCC** substituent.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's deduce the property value based on the patterns observed:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, C1CCCC1, CCC=C, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54)**: These have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that purely hydrocarbon structures (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, polyaromatics without polar groups) default to 0.0.

2. **Halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl)**: These also have a property value of **0.0**, indicating that halogens (Cl, Br, I) on aromatic rings do not significantly alter the property from the hydrocarbon baseline.

3. **Oxygen-containing aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCO, CCO, CCC(C)O)**: These consistently have a value of **-0.83939914**, suggesting that hydroxyl (-OH) groups in aliphatic chains drive the property to this negative value.

4. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., COc1ccccc1O, COC(=O)c1cccnc1)**: These have positive values (e.g., 1.7715234 for COc1ccccc1O), indicating that polar groups (like esters or ethers) on aromatics increase the property.

5. **Highly polar or conjugated systems (e.g., CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: These have high positive values (~2.04441581), likely due to carbonyl groups in rigid or conjugated systems.

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is a benzene ring with a **trifluoromethyl (-CF3)** group, which is a strongly electron-withdrawing but non-polar substituent (similar to halogens in terms of lacking hydrogen-bonding or significant dipole effects).
- From the examples, halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1) have a value of **0.0**, and -CF3 behaves similarly to halogens in this context (no additional polar contribution beyond halogens).
- There are no examples where -CF3 increases the property value compared to halogens.

Thus, the predicted property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.3028425726906894
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (a hexose sugar like glucose or mannitol, but with a more specific structure resembling a cyclic polyol).

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **-0.35586335**, and `CC(C)CCCO` has **-0.83939914**).
2. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic structure (as in this case) likely enhances hydrogen bonding and polarity, further lowering the property value.
3. The molecule is highly hydrophilic and lacks aromatic or nonpolar regions, which aligns with the trend of negative values for such structures.

Comparing to similar examples:
- The linear polyol `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **-0.35586335**.
- The cyclic polyol here is even more constrained and polar, so its value should be more negative.

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is likely close to **-0.8**, similar to other highly polar, cyclic polyols in the dataset. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.83939914**  
(Note: This matches the value for other cyclic/aliphatic polyols like `CC(C)CCCO` and `Oc1cccc2ccccc12` in the dataset, which share similar polarity and H-bonding features.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.0963767702705802
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule contains multiple carbonyl groups (acetate-like fragments: **CC(=O)O** and **CC(=O)C**), which are polar and can influence the property. 
   - Example: **CCOC(=O)C** has a value of **0.67449076**, suggesting carbonyls can contribute positively.
   - However, **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** has a value of **-0.3843269**, indicating that context matters (e.g., aliphatic vs. conjugated).

2. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings and hydroxyl groups (**C3(O)** and **C(O)**). 
   - Example: **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **1.15151681**, suggesting hydroxyls and carbonyls in a steroid framework can increase the property.
   - Another example: **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has a value of **-0.75557799**, but this lacks the additional hydroxyls and has an ester linkage.

3. **Conjugated system**: The **C=CC=C** fragment suggests some conjugation, which may slightly increase the property (e.g., aromatic systems like **c1ccncc1** have high values ~1.118).

4. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: The presence of hydroxyls (e.g., **C3(O)** and **C(O)**) can lower the property if not balanced by other features (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** has **-0.35586335**).

### Synthesis of trends:
- The steroid core with hydroxyls and carbonyls (like **CC1(O)CCC...**) tends to give values >1. 
- The additional acetate groups (**CC(=O)O**) may slightly reduce the effect (as esters/acetates are less polar than free hydroxyls).
- The conjugated **C=O** and **C=C** could add a small positive contribution.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (value = **1.15151681**) but with more polar/acetylated groups, the property is likely slightly lower but still positive. 

**Predicted value: ~0.9**  
(Exact prediction: **0.92**, considering the balance of hydroxyls, carbonyls, and conjugation.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest match is likely between **1.15151681** (steroid with hydroxyl and carbonyl) and **-0.75557799** (steroid with ester and carbonyl). Given the additional hydroxyls here, I'd lean toward the higher value. 

**Final predicted value: 1.05**  
(But to match the examples more precisely, **0.95** is a safer estimate.) 

After reconsidering the acetyl groups' reducing effect, the most plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.87**  

(Note: Without a clear linear trend, this is an approximate interpolation based on structural similarity.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 1.1515168059518852
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule (CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O), here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Zero Values (0.0):** 
   - Typically assigned to symmetric, non-polar, or highly halogenated aromatic systems (e.g., Brc1ccccc1, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl).
   - Also seen in simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCCC#C, C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13).

2. **Negative Values (Near -0.8):**
   - Associated with molecules containing hydroxyl groups (-OH) and aromatic/cyclic systems (e.g., Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.839, CC(C)CC(C)(C)O: -0.839).
   - Steroids or fused polycyclic structures with -OH groups (e.g., CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O: -0.0379).

3. **Target Molecule Features:**
   - **Structure:** A steroid-like tetracyclic system with a ketone (C=O) and a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH).
   - **Similarity to Examples:**
     - The hydroxyl group suggests a potential negative contribution (like Oc1ccccc1Cl).
     - The ketone and cyclic structure may moderate the effect (similar to CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has -0.0379).

### Prediction:
The molecule combines a hydroxyl group (tending toward -0.8) with a complex cyclic framework (moderating the effect). The closest analog is **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property: **-0.03790352**), which shares the steroid backbone and -OH group.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.03790352**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.39522248880829514
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tend to have negative or moderately positive values. For example:
     - O=N(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.72377934
     - O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12: -0.72377934
     - COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 1.26789948 (positive, likely due to the ether group COc)
   - The nitro group alone does not guarantee a negative value, but it often contributes to lower or moderate values unless balanced by other functional groups.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**:
   - The amide group (especially when attached to an aromatic ring) often appears in molecules with positive or near-zero values. For example:
     - CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1: 2.18817183 (very high, likely due to the large hydrophobic chain and tertiary amide)
     - O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2: -0.23447638 (moderate, nitro group lowers the value)
   - The amide group can increase the property value, but the overall effect depends on other substituents.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing/Directing Groups**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitro or amide substituents often have values in the range of -0.7 to +1.3, depending on the balance of groups.

4. **Specific Case of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**:
   - This molecule has:
     - An amide group (CC(=O)N-) attached to an aromatic ring.
     - A nitro group (-N(=O)=O) on the same aromatic ring (para position relative to the amide).
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value.
   - The amide group is moderately electron-donating (resonance effect), which may partially counteract the nitro group.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Ether + nitro on aromatic ring → 1.26789948.
- **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**: Nitro only on aromatic ring → -0.72377934.
- **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2**: Amide + nitro → -0.23447638.

The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has both an amide and a nitro group, so its value is likely between the nitro-only and amide-containing examples. The nitro group's strong effect may dominate, but the amide will pull the value higher than -0.72377934.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of effects, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.35808703** (similar to other molecules with competing electron-withdrawing and donating groups).

However, looking more closely, the molecule **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** has a nitro group and amide-like features and a value of **0.35808703**, which seems like a good match. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is:  
**0.35808703** (same as the structurally similar example). 

### Final Answer:
**0.35808703**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.6707552715332898
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, I'll attempt to predict the property based on the patterns observed in the provided data.

Key observations from the examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CC#CCC, C/C=C/C) typically have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules with aromatic rings without polar substituents tend to be 0.0
3. Oxygen-containing functional groups (especially hydroxyl -OH) often give negative values around -0.839
4. Carbonyl groups (C=O) and complex oxygen-containing structures tend to give positive values
5. Nitrogen-containing compounds show varied values, often positive
6. Halogenated compounds (Cl, Br) without other functional groups are typically 0.0
7. Phosphorus-containing compounds aren't present in examples, but similar to sulfur, might contribute to positive values

The molecule in question: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12

Breaking it down:
1. Contains a phosphate group (P=O) - likely positive contribution
2. Contains a thioether (S) - neutral in examples (e.g., CSSC = 0.0)
3. Contains a carbonyl (C=O) in the heterocycle - positive contribution
4. Contains a chloro-substituted aromatic ring - neutral in examples
5. Contains an ether linkage (OCC) - could be slightly positive

Looking at similar complex molecules in the examples:
- COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3 → 1.850
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O → 2.044
- CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O → 2.044

These suggest that molecules with multiple polar groups (especially carbonyls) tend to have values around 1.8-2.0. The presence of the phosphate group (even more polar than carbonyl) would likely push the value higher.

Given these observations, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately **2.2**.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated estimate based on the patterns in the provided data. The actual value might differ if the property has specific nonlinear relationships with certain functional groups.)

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - Simple alcohols like `CC(C)O`, `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)CO`, etc., consistently have a property value of **-0.83939914**.
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aliphatic carbon seems to correlate strongly with this value.

2. **Branched vs. Unbranched Alcohols**:
   - The property value **-0.83939914** appears regardless of branching (e.g., `CC(C)O` vs. `CC(C)CO` vs. `CCCC(O)CCC`).

3. **Tertiary Alcohols**:
   - The molecule `CC(C)(C)CO` is a tertiary alcohol (hydroxyl group attached to a carbon with three alkyl substituents), similar to other alcohols in the dataset.

4. **Exceptions**:
   - Polyols (like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`) deviate slightly but still retain a negative value close to the trend.
   - Other functional groups (e.g., nitro, halogen, aromatic systems) override the alcohol effect when present.

### Prediction for `CC(C)(C)CO`:
This is a tertiary alcohol with no other functional groups. All analogous alcohols in the dataset have the property value **-0.83939914**. Thus, the predicted value is:

**-0.83939914**

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.33974977928971484
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings (e.g., purine-like structures or fused nitrogen heterocycles) tend to have **negative property values** when they include polar groups (e.g., carbonyls or NH groups). Examples:
     - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` → **-0.51629858**
     - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` → **-0.51629858**
   - These structures exhibit electron-rich environments and hydrogen-bonding capacity, likely correlating with the negative property.

2. **Target Molecule**:
   - The SMILES **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** represents a **fused bicyclic system** (resembling a purine derivative) with:
     - A carbonyl group (C=O).
     - Two NH groups (hydrogen bond donors).
     - Multiple nitrogen atoms (hydrogen bond acceptors).
   - This is structurally similar to the examples above with negative property values.

3. **Property Trend**:
   - The property appears to reflect **electronic or hydrogen-bonding features**, with negative values for polar, heteroaromatic systems and zero for nonpolar/halogenated/aliphatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the strong resemblance to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (both ≈ **-0.516**), the predicted property for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is:

**-0.51629858**  

*(This matches the recurring value for similar structures in the dataset.)*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule `CC(C)OC=O`, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Alcohols (`-OH`) and Carboxylic Acids (`-COOH` or derivatives like esters)**:
   - Molecules with `-OH` (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)O`, `CC(O)C(C)(C)C`, `CCCCCCCO`) consistently have a property value of **-0.83939914**.
   - The molecule `CC(C)OC=O` is an ester (methyl acetate derivative), which is structurally similar to alcohols in terms of polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. Esters like `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` and `COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O` have property values close to **-0.839** or **-0.499**, suggesting esters may fall in a similar range.

2. **Non-polar or Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - Molecules like `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (polycyclic aromatic), `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (halogenated aromatic), or `CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) have a property value of **0.0**, indicating no significant polarity or functional group contribution.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - `CCCOC(C)C` (ether) has a high value (**2.10455951**), but this seems atypical compared to other ethers/esters. This might be an outlier or due to additional steric/electronic effects.
   - `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67` (complex polyfunctional) has **0.759**, but this is likely due to multiple functional groups canceling out.

### Prediction for `CC(C)OC=O`:
- The molecule is an ester (`-COO-`), similar to `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (property **-0.83918721**) and `COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O` (**-0.499724**). 
- The simpler ester (`CC(C)OC=O`) is likely closer to the alcohol trend (**-0.839**) due to the dominant polar effect of the ester group, but slightly less negative because esters are less polar than alcohols. 
- Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **-0.839**, matching the alcohol trend (since esters and alcohols are both polar and hydrogen-bond acceptors).

### Final Answer:
**-0.83939914** (same as the alcohol/ester trend in the dataset).

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.25584207156954974
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea moiety (**N-C(=O)-N**). 
   - The urea group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as a donor and acceptor).
   - The phenyl rings are hydrophobic but can engage in π-π interactions.

2. **Comparison with Given Examples**:
   - **Similarity to amides/ureas**: 
     - Example: `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (property = 1.28183238) is a cyclic urea/amide with hydrogen-bonding capability.
     - Example: `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (property = 2.1443262) is an amide with an aromatic ring and strong hydrogen bonding.
   - **Aromatic rings**: 
     - Example: `c1ccncc1` (property = 1.11836185) is a simple aromatic ring with nitrogen, showing moderate polarity.
     - Example: `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (property = 0.75979875) is an amide with aromatic rings, but less polar than urea.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Urea derivatives tend to have higher property values due to strong hydrogen bonding (e.g., 1.28183238 for the cyclic urea).
   - The presence of two aromatic rings adds some hydrophobicity but does not dominate over the urea's polarity.
   - The molecule lacks strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups (like NO₂ or OH), so the value won't be as extreme as some examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong hydrogen-bonding capability of the urea group and the aromatic rings, the property value is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.28183238**  
*(This matches the cyclic urea example, as the hydrogen-bonding capability is similar, and the aromatic rings balance the polarity.)* 

### Note:
If the exact value must be distinct from the cyclic urea example, a slight adjustment could be made (e.g., **1.25**), but the given data suggests that the urea moiety's contribution is dominant, and the value is likely very close to the cyclic urea case.

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings: two benzene rings fused to a cyclopentadiene ring).

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene derivatives (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Fc1cccc(F)c1`, `Brc1ccccc1`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a large PAH) also have a property value of **0.0**.

2. **Substituents and Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with non-aromatic functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, halogens, etc.) deviate from 0.0.
   - The property seems to be influenced by polarity, hydrogen bonding, or other electronic effects (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1` has a value of 1.42428511 due to the amine group).

3. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)**:
   - This is a purely aromatic system with no polar or functionalized substituents, similar to the examples of benzene and larger PAHs that have a value of 0.0.
   - The central cyclopentadiene ring is still part of an extended aromatic system, and the molecule lacks polar or ionizable groups.

### Prediction:
Since fluorene is a purely aromatic hydrocarbon with no functional groups or heteroatoms, its property value should be **0.0**, consistent with other similar examples in the dataset.

True Property: -0.14774882645866805
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (≥ 2.0):**
   - Molecules with **sulfonyl groups (S(=O)=O)** or **phosphoryl groups (P=O)** often have high values (e.g., 2.18816718, 2.12150701, 2.15220875).
   - **Multiple polar/charged groups** (e.g., amides, nitro, or heterocycles) also contribute to higher values.

2. **Moderate Property Values (0.3–1.9):**
   - Molecules with **single polar groups** (e.g., esters, amides, nitro) or **small heterocycles** tend to fall in this range (e.g., 1.14400549, 0.67449076).

3. **Low/Zero Property Values (≤ 0.0):**
   - **Non-polar hydrocarbons** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, aromatics without polar substituents) consistently have 0.0.
   - **Halogenated non-polar molecules** (e.g., CCl4-like structures) also have 0.0 unless paired with polar groups.

4. **Negative Values:**
   - Occur with **alcohols (OH)** or **weakly polar groups** in certain contexts (e.g., -0.83939914 for Ph-OH or aliphatic OH).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**
- **Structural Features:**
  1. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)=O)**: Strongly polar, often associated with high values (e.g., 2.18816718, 2.12150701).
  2. **Guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N)**: Highly polar and basic, similar to amidines/guanidines in other examples (e.g., 2.18816718 for NC(=O)N).
  3. **Aromatic amine (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Adds polarity but less impactful than sulfonyl/guanidine.

- **Analogous Examples:**
  - **CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (2.18817183)**: Contains polar amide and alkyne, but sulfonyl is even more polar.
  - **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O (2.15220875)**: Sulfonyl with heterocycle.
  - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12 (-0.72958269)**: Less polar than our target.

### Prediction:
Given the **sulfonyl + guanidine + aromatic amine** combination, this molecule is **highly polar** and likely has a property value **≥ 2.0**, similar to other sulfonyl-containing examples. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.18816718**  
*(This aligns with the high-end values observed for sulfonyl+polar groups in the examples.)*

True Property: -0.05862383079664008
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property value based on structural features and trends observed in the provided data. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC..., Sc1ccccc1, Brc1ccccc1)** typically have a property value of **0.0**, unless they have significant functional groups or polar features.
2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** often contribute positively to the property value (e.g., +0.550 for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O).
3. **Amine or amide groups** can vary but often contribute moderately (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1 has -0.729).
4. **Fluorine substitutions (e.g., C(F)(F)F)** can increase the property value due to electronegativity.
5. **Aromatic systems with multiple nitro groups** tend to have higher values (e.g., Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has 1.713).

### Target Molecule: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
- **Structure**: 
  - Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)...).
  - Aromatic ring with two nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F).
  - The presence of two nitro groups and a strongly electron-withdrawing CF3 group suggests a high property value.
- **Analogous Examples**:
  - Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (1.713) has two nitro-like features.
  - CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (2.188) has strong electron-withdrawing groups (Cl).
  - The CF3 group is even more electron-withdrawing than Cl, and the two nitro groups will further increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects (two nitro groups + CF3) and the aromatic system, the property value should be **higher than 1.713 but less than 2.188**. A reasonable estimate would be around **1.9**.

However, looking more closely:
- The molecule has two nitro groups and a CF3, similar to the Cl-substituted example (2.188), but with even stronger withdrawing effects. 
- The amine (CCN) might slightly reduce the value compared to pure nitro/CF3 dominance.

Thus, a refined prediction is **~1.85**.

### Final Answer:
**1.85** (approximate, based on structural analogies and trends).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**: 
   - Molecules like **C1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptane)**, **c1ccccc1 (benzene)**, **C=CC=C (butadiene)**, and **ClC=C (chloroethene)** have a property value of **0.0**. These are hydrocarbons or simple halogenated hydrocarbons with no polar or functional groups beyond halogens or double bonds.

2. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(C)O (heptan-2-ol)**, **CCCCCCCCO (octan-1-ol)**, and **CCC(O)CC (butan-2-ol)** consistently have a property value of **-0.83939914**. The presence of an **-OH** group seems to correlate with this value.

3. **Aldehydes (R-CHO)**:
   - Molecules like **CCCC=O (butanal)** and **O=C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexanone)** have a property value of **-0.3843269**. The **-CHO** or **-C=O** (aldehyde/ketone) group seems to correlate with this value.

4. **Esters (R-COOR')**:
   - Molecules like **CC(C)CCOC=O (isobutyl formate)** and **CCCCCOC(=O)C (hexyl acetate)** have a property value of **0.67449076**. The ester functional group (**-COOR**) seems to correlate with this value.

5. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - More complex or polar groups (e.g., amides, nitro groups, heterocycles) tend to have higher or more variable values, but simple functional groups follow the above trends.

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester (specifically, **isopropyl formate**). Its structure is:
- **R-COOR'** where **R = H (formate)** and **R' = isopropyl (CH(CH3)2)**.

From the examples:
- Esters like **CC(C)CCOC=O (isobutyl formate)** and **CCCCCOC(=O)C (hexyl acetate)** have a property value of **0.67449076**.
- The exact structure of **CC(C)OC=O (isopropyl formate)** is very similar to these, differing only in the alkyl group (isopropyl vs. isobutyl or hexyl). The property value for esters seems consistent regardless of the specific alkyl chain length or branching.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the consistency of ester examples, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): 0.0
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** (triphenyl): 0.0
   - **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (naphthalene): 0.0
   - **Cc1ccccc1C** (toluene derivative): 0.0
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2** (chlorinated biphenyl): 0.0
   - **Brc1ccc(I)cc1** (halogenated benzene): 0.0

   These suggest that simple aromatic rings (even with halogens or alkyl groups) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups are present.

2. **Hydroxy (-OH) Substituents**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (multiple -OH groups): 0.89083637
   - **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** (multiple -OH groups): 2.10564501
   - **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (two -OH groups): -0.03790352
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): -0.83939914

   The presence of -OH groups tends to increase the property value, but the exact effect depends on the number and position of -OH groups. A single -OH (phenol) gives -0.83939914, while multiple -OH groups give higher values.

3. **Methyl (-CH3) Substituents**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (dimethylbenzene): 0.0
   - **CCc1ccccc1C** (ethylbenzene derivative): 0.0
   - **Cc1cccc(N)c1** (methylaniline): 0.56586262

   Methyl groups alone on an aromatic ring do not significantly affect the property (often 0.0), but when combined with other functional groups (e.g., -NH2), the value changes.

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with the structure:
  - A benzene ring with:
    - Two methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 1 and 3 (meta to each other).
    - One hydroxy group (-OH) at position 5 (para to one methyl and meta to the other).
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): -0.83939914
  - **Cc1cccc(N)c1** (methylaniline): 0.56586262
  - **Cc1ccccc1C** (xylene derivative): 0.0

The presence of the -OH group suggests the value should be close to phenol (-0.83939914), but the additional methyl groups may slightly increase the value (as seen in methylaniline, where -NH2 + -CH3 gives 0.56586262 vs. -NH2 alone would likely be higher).

However, since methyl groups alone (e.g., xylene) give 0.0, the dominant effect here is likely from the -OH group, but the methyl groups may slightly offset the negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the -OH group and the minor influence of the methyl groups, the value is likely close to phenol but slightly less negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.71** (between phenol's -0.839 and methylaniline's +0.565, but closer to phenol due to the -OH group being the primary contributor). 

However, looking at the examples, the closest match is phenol (-0.839), and the methyl groups may not significantly alter this. Thus, the most likely value is:

**Final predicted property value: -0.83939914** (same as phenol, as methyl groups alone do not significantly change the value in other examples). 

But considering **Cc1cccc(N)c1** (methylaniline) is 0.565, and phenol is -0.839, the net effect of -OH + -CH3 might average to somewhere in between. Given the lack of exact matches, the safest bet is to assume the -OH dominates, so:

**Predicted value: -0.71** (approximate interpolation). 

However, the examples suggest that simple -OH on aromatic rings gives -0.839, and additional substituents like -CH3 do not drastically change this unless paired with other functional groups. Thus, the most consistent answer is:

**Predicted property value: -0.83939914** (same as phenol). 

But to be precise, since **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (two -OH + alkyl) is -0.037, and phenol is -0.839, a single -OH + alkyl might be around -0.4 to -0.6. Given the uncertainty, I'll average phenol and methylaniline:

(-0.839 + 0.565)/2 ≈ -0.137, but this seems too high. 

Given the data, the most defensible answer is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3843269** (similar to **O=Cc1ccccc1**, which has a carbonyl + aromatic, but this is not exact. Alternatively, split the difference between phenol and methylaniline). 

Given the ambiguity, the closest match is phenol, so:

**Final answer: -0.83939914** (same as phenol, as methyl substitution does not significantly alter the value in other examples). 

However, this is likely too negative. A better estimate is halfway between phenol (-0.839) and methylaniline (+0.565), weighted toward phenol:

Approx. -0.5. 

But the examples do not support this well. Given the data, the safest conservative answer is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3843269** (similar to other mono-substituted aromatics with polar groups). 

But this is uncertain. The most consistent answer based on phenol is:

**-0.83939914**. 

Given the lack of closer examples, I will stick with:

**Predicted property value: -0.3843269** (as a compromise between phenol and methylaniline). 

However, after reconsidering, the phenol value (-0.839) is likely the best reference, so:

**Final answer: -0.83939914**. 

But this seems too negative. Given the examples, the true value is likely between -0.384 and -0.839. 

Given the uncertainty, I will predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.6** (interpolated between -0.839 and +0.565). 

But to match the format, I'll choose the closest example value, which is:

**-0.3843269** (from **O=Cc1ccccc1**). 

Thus:

**Predicted property value: -0.3843269**. 

However, this is not perfect. The true value is likely between -0.384 and -0.839. 

Given the data, the most consistent answer is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3843269**. 

### Final Answer:
- **Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -0.3843269**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.2028568322453446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate/Phosphate Derivatives**:
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment (phosphorothioate group) tend to have property values around **1.20285683** (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`).
   - These values are consistent even with substitutions on the aromatic ring (e.g., Cl, Br, I).

2. **Aromatic Substitutions**:
   - The presence of **SC** (thioether) or **C** (methyl) on the aromatic ring does not significantly alter the property value for phosphorothioates, as seen in other examples where substitutions like Cl/Br/I do not change the value.

3. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Non-phosphorothioate molecules with **O** or **Cl** substitutions often have values around **-0.83939914** or **0.0**, but these are not relevant here.

### Prediction for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:
- The molecule contains the **COP(=S)(OC)O** phosphorothioate group, which is strongly associated with the value **1.20285683** in the examples.
- The aromatic ring has **SC** and **C** substitutions, but these are unlikely to significantly deviate the property from the phosphorothioate baseline (as substitutions like Cl/Br/I did not change it).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is:  
**1.20285683**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`), we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have a property value of **0.0**. 
   - These are symmetric, heavily chlorinated biphenyl or polyaromatic structures, and their property value consistently trends to **0.0**.

2. **The Given Molecule**:
   - The molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` is a **hexachlorinated biphenyl derivative** (similar to the examples above but with slightly less symmetry). 
   - It shares the key features of multiple chlorines on aromatic rings, which in the examples always result in a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Exceptions**:
   - The only chlorinated aromatic molecules with non-zero values are those with additional polar or functional groups (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O` has a value of 1.598 due to the sulfonamide and amide groups). 
   - The given molecule has no such functional groups—only chlorines.

### Conclusion:
The property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` is predicted to be **0.0**, consistent with other heavily chlorinated aromatic systems in the dataset. 

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7237793359215606
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, we can predict its property value by comparing it to similar functional groups and structural motifs in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functional Group Analysis**: The molecule has a **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to a short aliphatic chain (**CCC**). Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and often contribute to higher property values when combined with certain structural features (e.g., aromatic rings or polar groups). However, in this case, the nitro group is on a simple propane chain.

2. **Similar Examples in the Dataset**:
   - **N(=O)=O** appears in several molecules, often with high property values when attached to aromatic systems (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** has a value of **2.13867221**).
   - However, when the nitro group is on a non-aromatic or less polar scaffold, the property value tends to be lower or neutral. For example:
     - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.05862383** (nitro on an aromatic ring but with additional aliphatic chains).
     - Simple aliphatic chains like **CCC** or **CCCC** typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they are part of a more complex polar structure.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The nitro group alone does not guarantee a high property value unless it is part of a conjugated or aromatic system.
   - The **CCCN(=O)=O** structure is analogous to **propyl nitrite/nitropropane**, where the aliphatic chain dominates the property, and the nitro group's impact is muted due to lack of conjugation.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the lack of aromaticity or additional polar groups, the property value is likely **close to 0.0** but slightly negative due to the nitro group's weak contribution in this context.
   - A reasonable estimate is **-0.05 to -0.1**, aligning with the slight negativity seen in similar aliphatic nitro compounds in the dataset.

**Final Predicted Property Value**: **-0.05862383** (matching the closest analogous example in the dataset). 

This matches the behavior of **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, where the nitro group on an aliphatic chain gives a slightly negative value. Thus, the prediction is consistent with the trend.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. Simple halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, BrC(Br)Br, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl) consistently show a property value of 0.0.

2. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a simple halogenated aromatic compound with fluorine and bromine substituents, similar to other examples that have property values of 0.0.

3. There are no examples where simple mono- or di-halogenated benzenes (with F, Cl, Br) have non-zero property values, unless they contain additional functional groups that clearly modify the property (like nitro groups, carbonyls, etc.).

4. The presence of both F and Br on the benzene ring doesn't appear in any non-zero examples, and structurally similar dihalogenated benzenes all show 0.0.

Therefore, based on these observations and the consistent pattern for simple halogenated aromatics, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is:

0.0

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, I can make the following observations:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a **steroid-like bicyclic structure** with **hydroxyl (OH) and methyl (CH3) groups**.
   - It resembles some of the steroid-derived molecules in the dataset (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a property of **-0.82081738**).
   - The presence of **OH** suggests some polarity, but the bulky aliphatic rings dominate the property.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with **steroid-like or fused aliphatic rings** and **OH groups** tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., **-0.82081738**, **-0.77349768**).
   - The absence of highly polar or charged groups (like **-SO2NH2**, **-COO⁻**, or **-N⁺**) suggests the property is not strongly negative.
   - The molecule lacks **halogens (Cl, F, Br)**, which in some cases contribute to a property of **0.0** (e.g., **CBr, CCCCBr**).

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given the **steroid-like core + OH group**, the property is likely **moderately negative**, similar to other steroid-derived examples.
   - The closest structural analog in the dataset is **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (property = **-0.82081738**), but our molecule is simpler (no ketone or fluorines).
   - Another close match is **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property = **-0.77349768**).

4. **Final Estimate**:
   - The property is likely in the range of **-0.75 to -0.85**.
   - A reasonable prediction is **-0.80**, balancing between the examples.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 2.1303418630920077
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with simple, symmetric, or non-polar structures (e.g., halogens like Cl, Br, or aromatic systems without polar functional groups) often have a property value of 0.0. Examples:
     - `ClC2=C(Cl)C3(Cl)C1C=CCC1C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl` (hexachlorocyclopentadiene, highly halogenated, symmetric).
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, no polar groups).

2. **Property > 0.0**:
   - Molecules with polar or ionizable functional groups (e.g., amides, nitro groups, or heterocycles with N/O/S) tend to have positive property values. Higher values are often associated with multiple polar groups or conjugated systems. Examples:
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitroacetamilide, property = -0.395) is an exception, but most nitro-containing compounds are positive.
     - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (nicotinamide, property = 2.144) has a polar amide and aromatic nitrogen.
     - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = 2.130) has a thiophosphate group and an amide.

3. **Property < 0.0**:
   - Molecules with carbonyls (e.g., ketones, aldehydes) or electronegative atoms in specific configurations can have negative values. Examples:
     - `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid with ketones, property = -0.756).
     - `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (chlorophenol, property = -0.839).

### Target Molecule: **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**
- **Structural Features**:
  - Contains a **thiophosphate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**, similar to the example `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = 2.130).
  - Also has an **amide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**, which is polar and often associated with positive property values.
  - The structure is highly polar and resembles the example with a property of **2.130**.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example with a property of **2.13034186**, the predicted property for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely very close to this value. 

#### Final Answer:
**2.13** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

(Note: The exact value may vary slightly due to subtle structural differences, but the presence of the thiophosphate and amide groups strongly suggests a value in the **2.1–2.2 range**.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.9180513278042104
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **quinoxaline-like** core with a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and **two nitrogen atoms** in a fused ring system. This is similar to the structure **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 1.89591301), which also has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and nitrogen atoms.
   
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Two **methyl groups (C)** attached to the nitrogen atoms.
   - A **phenyl ring (c2ccccc2)** fused to the heterocycle.

3. **Polarity/Electronics**: The presence of the **C=O group** and **nitrogen atoms** introduces polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions, which often correlate with higher property values in the given examples (e.g., 1.89591301 for the similar fused system).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 1.89591301), which shares:
  - A fused aromatic system with a carbonyl.
  - Nitrogen atoms in the ring.
  - Similar substituents (methyl and phenyl groups).
- Other molecules with **C=O and nitrogen** in aromatic systems (e.g., **CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3**, property = 0.59729128) also have positive but lower values, but the fused system here is more similar to the first example.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 1.89591301), but with slightly less extended conjugation (one less fused benzene ring), the property value is likely slightly lower but still in a similar range. 

**Predicted property value: 1.75** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

However, since the examples suggest exact values, the closest match is likely **1.89591301** (same as the very similar fused system). 

### Final Answer:
**1.89591301**

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)**:
   - Simple alkanes/alkenes/aromatics (e.g., `CCC(=C)C`, `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1`, `CCCCCCCI`) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - This suggests that pure hydrocarbons without functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0.

2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:

     - `CCC(O)C(C)C` and `CC(C)C(C)O` both have a value of **-0.83939914**.
     - Polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)CO` have a much higher value (**2.17589181**).
   - **Ethers (`-O-`)**: 
     - `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` has a value of **-0.83918721** (similar to alcohols).

3. **Halogenated compounds**:
   - Most halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1I`, `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`) have a value of **0.0** unless combined with other functional groups (e.g., `ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` has **0.75979875** due to the presence of `-OC(=O)N-`).

4. **Nitrogen-containing groups**:
   - Nitriles (`-C#N`) like `N#Cc1ccccc1` have **-0.23419293**.
   - Amides (`-CONH-`) and other N-heterocycles often have positive values (e.g., `O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13` has **1.96903937**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**
- This is an **ester** (`-COO-`) with the structure: hexanoic acid ethyl ester (`CCCCCC(=O)OCC`).
- From the examples, esters like `CC(C)OC(=O)C` and `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` have a property value of **0.67449076**.
- The chain length (hexyl vs. shorter/longer chains in other esters) does not seem to significantly affect the value, as `CC(C)OC(=O)C` (short chain) and `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (long chain) both have the same value.

### Conclusion:
The property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is most likely the same as other esters in the examples: **0.67449076**.

### Final Answer:
**0.67449076**

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns for the property in question:

1. Simple aromatic esters with small alkyl groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1) have property values around 0.67449076
2. The presence of a methyl ester (COC=O) attached to a phenyl ring appears consistently in this value range
3. The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate, property = 0.67449076), just with a methyl group instead of ethyl
4. The ester functional group seems to be the dominant feature determining this property value range
5. Other substituents on the ring or changes to the alkyl group length beyond methyl/ethyl affect the value differently

Since methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is even simpler than ethyl benzoate and maintains the same core ester+phenyl structure, I would predict it should have a very similar property value, likely slightly lower but in the same range.

Based on the consistent pattern for aromatic esters in the examples, I predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be:

0.67449076

This matches exactly with the ethyl benzoate example (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), and since the methyl/ethyl difference doesn't appear to significantly change this property in other similar cases, this is the most reasonable prediction.

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be related to some form of molecular descriptor or calculated property (e.g., logP, polar surface area, or another quantitative measure). The key observations from the examples are:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics without polar groups)** consistently have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `CC/C=C/C` (butene-like structure) → 0.0
   - `CCCc1ccccc1` (propylbenzene) → 0.0
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene-like) → 0.0
   - `C1CCCC1` (cyclopentane) → 0.0

2. **Polar or functionalized molecules** deviate from 0.0 (either positive or negative). 

The molecule in question, `C=CCC=C` (1,3-butadiene), is a simple hydrocarbon with no polar or functional groups (just conjugated double bonds). Based on the pattern, **its property value should be 0.0**, as it fits the category of non-polar, unfunctionalized hydrocarbons. 

### Predicted property value: **0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be **0.0** for molecules that are either simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) or symmetric/non-polar structures (e.g., `C1CCCCC1`, `CCCCCC(C)C`). 

The molecule `BrC(Br)Br` (tribromomethane) is a simple, symmetric, fully halogenated alkane with no additional functional groups or polar features that would contribute to a non-zero property value in the given dataset. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `BrC(Br)Br` is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 2.1303418630920077
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons, halogens, or symmetric/rigid structures (e.g., benzene derivatives with halogens, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes)** tend to have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) → 0.0  
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) → 0.0  
   - `CCC(C)Cl` (chlorobutane) → 0.0  

2. **Polar or functionalized molecules** (e.g., carbonyls, amines, sulfonamides, heterocycles, or complex scaffolds) tend to have **non-zero values**, either positive or negative. Examples:
   - `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` (succinimide derivative) → -0.492  
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` (sulfonamide) → 1.195  
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (phosphorothioate) → 0.589  

3. **Negative values** are often associated with:
   - **Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors** (e.g., `OCC(O)CO...` → -0.266).  
   - **Aromatic systems with polar substituents** (e.g., `c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2` → -0.839).  

4. **Positive values** are often seen in:
   - **Heterocycles with polar groups** (e.g., `c1ccncc1` → 1.118).  
   - **Complex fused rings with electronegative atoms** (e.g., `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` → 1.192).  

### Analysis of the target molecule:
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`  
- Contains a **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)`), similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = 0.589).  
- Also has a **lactam ring** (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`), which introduces polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.  
- The **chloroalkyl group** (`C(CCl)`) adds some polarity but is less impactful than the other features.  

### Comparison to similar examples:
1. The phosphorothioate group alone (as in the example) gives ~0.589.  
2. The lactam ring (similar to `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`) contributes additional polarity, likely pushing the value higher.  
3. The molecule lacks strongly negative features (e.g., multiple hydroxyls), so the value should remain positive.  

### Predicted property:
Given the combined effects of the phosphorothioate and lactam moieties, the value is likely **between 0.5 and 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 0.85**  

This aligns with the trend where phosphorothioates with additional polar groups (but no strong negative contributors) fall in this range.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.133535002958133
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups like **-OH**, **-NH₂**, or **-NO₂** often have negative property values (e.g., `-0.83939914` for phenol derivatives like `Cc1ccc(O)cc1`).
   - Amides (`-CONH-`) and sulfonamides tend to have moderately negative or positive values depending on other substituents (e.g., `-0.30696509` for `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C`).

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems without polar groups (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`) have a property value of `0.0`.
   - Aromatics with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `-NO₂`, halogens) often have negative values (e.g., `-0.72377934` for `Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`).

3. **Complex Heterocycles**:
   - Molecules with fused heterocycles or multiple polar groups can have positive values (e.g., `1.94656985` for `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23`).

4. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - Halogens alone (e.g., `ClCCCCl`) typically contribute `0.0`, but when combined with polar groups, they may shift the value negatively or positively.

5. **Steric Bulk**:
   - Bulky groups like tert-butyl (`C(C)(C)C`) can influence the property, especially when combined with polar groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule has the following features:
- **Amide group**: `CN(C)C(=O)N-` (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C`, which has `-0.30696509`).
- **Aromatic ring with chlorine**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, which has `-0.72377934`).
- **Heterocycle (oxadiazole)**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` (similar to fused heterocycles in the training data, which can increase the value).
- **Tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` (steric bulk, may slightly increase the value).

### Comparison to Training Examples:
- The closest analog is `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (`-0.30696509`), but the target molecule has additional polar (Cl) and heterocyclic features.
- The presence of the oxadiazole and chlorine likely pushes the value toward the positive side compared to simple amides.
- The tert-butyl group may further increase the value slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar (negative contribution) and heterocyclic/bulky (positive contribution) features, the predicted value is approximately **`0.5`**. 

However, looking more closely:
- The oxadiazole (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) is similar to the heterocycle in `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (`1.94656985`), but the target molecule has more polar groups.
- The amide + aromatic Cl combination is similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (`-0.30696509`) and `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (`-0.72377934`), but the heterocycle adds positivity.

Thus, a refined estimate is **`0.25`**.

### Final Prediction:
After considering all structural contributions, the predicted property value for **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** is:

**`0.25`** (with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.2 based on the training data variability). 

This balances the negative contribution of the polar amide/Cl with the positive contribution of the heterocycle and steric bulk.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1.7715234040615286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol-like structures with Cl substituents**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.83939914
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -0.83939914
   - These molecules have multiple Cl substituents on a phenol ring, and their property values are consistently **-0.83939914**.

2. **Other phenol-like structures**:
   - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: Property = 1.15151681 (presence of aldehyde increases the value).
   - **Oc1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**: Property = 0.89083637 (multiple OH groups increase the value).

3. **General trends**:
   - Multiple Cl substituents on aromatic rings (especially phenols) tend to result in a property value of **-0.83939914**.
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O) can increase the property value, while halogens (Cl, Br) tend to decrease it or keep it low.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** consists of:
- Two phenol rings linked by an oxygen bridge (diphenyl ether structure).
- Three Cl substituents (one on the first ring and two on the second ring).

This is structurally similar to the examples with multiple Cl-substituted phenols, which consistently have a property value of **-0.83939914**. The additional oxygen bridge does not appear to significantly alter the property in the given examples (e.g., ether linkages in other molecules do not drastically change the value).

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong consistency of **-0.83939914** for Cl-substituted phenols, the predicted property for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:

**-0.83939914**

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule `CC/C=C\C` (which is a trans-2-butene structure) is very similar to `CC/C=C/C` (also a butene isomer, likely cis-2-butene or another conformation), which has a property value of **0.0**. 

Additionally, other simple hydrocarbons like `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C` (hexamethylbenzene), `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (tetracosane), and `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) also have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that the property is likely related to some form of polarity, hydrogen bonding, or functional group contribution, and simple alkenes without polar groups tend to have a value of 0.0.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 2.1045595084625406
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and halogenated hydrocarbons (without other functional groups) tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `CC#C`, `CC(C)Cl`, `C1CCCCCC1`, `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).

2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (`-OH`) often have a property value of **-0.83939914** (e.g., `CC(C)O`, `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1`, `CCC(O)CC`).

3. Ethers (e.g., `CCOC`) are not explicitly listed in the examples, but `CCCOCC` is a simple ether (dipropyl ether) with no other functional groups. 

Given that ethers are structurally similar to alkanes (just with an oxygen linker) and lack strongly polarizing functional groups like `-OH` or `=O`, the property value is likely **0.0**, following the trend of simple hydrocarbons. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCOCC` is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 2.1881718265953576
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Bulky Substituents**:  
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (e.g., biphenyl-like structures) and bulky substituents (e.g., **C(C)(C)** or **N(C)C=O**) tend to have property values **close to 0.0** (e.g., **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 = 0.0**, **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13 = 0.0**).  
   - The presence of **tert-butyl groups (C(C)(C)C)** or **diaryl amides (N(C(=O)))** does not significantly deviate from this trend unless paired with strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl).

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:  
   - **Amides (N-C=O)**: When part of a flexible linker (e.g., **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 = -0.595**), the value is moderately negative. However, rigid or symmetric amides (e.g., in **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) are less polarizable and closer to **0.0**.  
   - **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: Strongly increase the value (e.g., **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O = 2.171**), but these are absent here.

3. **Symmetry and Neutrality**:  
   - The target molecule is symmetric (two phenyl rings and a central amide/tert-butyl group) and lacks strongly polar/ionic groups, aligning with examples like **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 = 0.0**.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- **Structure**:  
  - Central **tert-butyl-substituted amide (N-C(=O)-N(C)(C)C)** with two phenyl rings.  
  - No nitro, sulfonyl, or highly polar groups.  
  - Symmetric and bulky, similar to **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.0).  

- **Prediction**:  
  The property value is likely **0.0**, as the molecule's neutrality and symmetry match other examples with this value.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 1.6706485207751764
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes (e.g., CCCC, C=C, C≡C)**: Typically have a property value of **0.0** unless functional groups are present.
   - Example: `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C` (hexamethylbenzene) → **0.0**.
   - Example: `CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C` → **0.0**.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, C=O)**:
   - Alcohols (`-OH`): Often have a value of **-0.83939914** (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C`, `CO`, `CCC(C)O`).
   - Ethers (`-O-`): Similar to alcohols (e.g., `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` → **-0.83918721**).
   - Carbonyl (`C=O`): Can vary but often negative (e.g., `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2` → **0.66312565**, but this is a cyclic imide).

3. **Nitrogen-Containing Functional Groups (e.g., -NH2, -NO2, -N=)**:
   - Nitro (`-NO2`): `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` → **-0.72377934**.
   - Amides (`-CONH-`): `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is an amide, but no exact match in examples. However, `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → **2.18817183**, but this is a more complex tertiary amide.
   - Aromatic amines (`-NH2` on benzene): `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` → **0.56586262**.

4. **Bromine-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` → **0.0** (fully brominated benzene).
   - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` → **0.0**.
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **-0.83939914** (phenol with bromine).

5. **Amides**:
   - The given molecule is **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (N-phenylacetamide with bromine substitution). 
   - Similar to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (phenol with bromine → **-0.83939914**), but here the oxygen is replaced with an amide (`-NH-CO-CH3`).
   - Amides are polar and can hydrogen bond, similar to alcohols, but the presence of bromine may reduce the value slightly.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is an amide derivative of bromobenzene. Given that:
- Simple brominated aromatics often have **0.0**.
- Amides can have negative values (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is an outlier due to complexity).
- Phenol with bromine (`Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`) is **-0.83939914**, but replacing -OH with -NH-CO-CH3 (amide) may not drastically change the value.

A reasonable estimate is close to the phenol-bromine case but slightly less negative due to the amide group's intermediate polarity. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.72377934** (similar to nitrobenzene, as amides and nitro groups have comparable effects in some contexts). 

However, if we consider the amide's similarity to alcohols (but less polar), a value between **-0.72377934** and **-0.83939914** is plausible. Given the examples, **-0.72377934** is the closest match for a moderately polar group like an amide. 

Final answer: **-0.72377934**.
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC#C, C=Cc1ccccc1, CCC=C) typically have a property value of 0.0.
2. Branched aliphatic alcohols (e.g., CC(C)CO, CCC(C)O, CC(C)CCO) consistently have a value of -0.83939914.
3. Aromatic rings without polar substituents (e.g., Cc1ccccc1N, Cc1cccc2ccccc12) have values ranging from 0.0 to positive numbers when nitrogen is present.
4. The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is an isobutylbenzene structure - a branched aliphatic chain (isobutyl) attached to a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene derivative) has value 0.0
- Cc1ccccc1 (toluene) isn't shown but would be similar
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (isopropylbenzene derivative) has value 0.0

The isobutyl group alone would suggest -0.83939914 if it were an alcohol, but since it's a hydrocarbon chain attached to benzene with no polar groups, this matches the 0.0 pattern seen in other aromatic hydrocarbons with aliphatic side chains.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is: 0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3843269010954972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Aldehydes/Ketones**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide with a hydroxyl group) has a value of **0.56952375**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **1.15861217**, but this is more influenced by the nitro groups.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (a more complex structure with two aromatic rings and carbonyl groups) has a high value of **2.10825153**.

2. **Benzene Derivatives**:
   - Simple unsubstituted or alkyl-substituted benzenes (e.g., **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12**, **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45**) have a value of **0.0**.
   - Substitution with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**) gives a value of **0.55016506**.

3. **Carbonyl-Containing Aromatics**:
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) directly attached to an aromatic ring (as in benzaldehyde) tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkyl-substituted benzenes but not as much as nitro or multiple polar groups.

4. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - The closest example is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (hydroxybenzamide) with a value of **0.56952375**. Benzaldehyde is simpler, lacking the amide and hydroxyl groups, so its value should be lower but still positive.

### Prediction for O=Cc1ccccc1 (Benzaldehyde):
- Benzaldehyde has a single carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring. This introduces some polarity but is less impactful than nitro or hydroxyl groups.
- Compared to simple benzenes (value = 0.0) and hydroxybenzamide (value = 0.56952375), benzaldehyde should have a moderate positive value.
- No examples of pure benzaldehyde are given, but extrapolating from similar structures, I predict a value slightly lower than hydroxybenzamide but higher than unsubstituted benzene.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **~0.4**. 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **0.40**. (Note: If forced to pick from the exact values in the examples, the closest is **0.3843269**, but this is for a non-aromatic carbonyl. For benzaldehyde, I'd lean toward **0.40** as a novel prediction.) 

However, since the examples include **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** with a value of **-0.3843269** (non-aromatic carbonyl) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** with **0.56952375**, benzaldehyde likely falls between these. A precise guess is **0.40**. 

If you require an exact match to the given examples, the closest is **0.3843269**, but this is not aromatic. Thus, **0.40** is a more appropriate novel prediction. 

**Answer: 0.40** (or approximately **0.3843269** if forced to match an existing example). 

Given the task constraints, I'd finalize the prediction as **0.40**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural analogies. The true value may differ if the property has specific nonlinear dependencies.)

1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of **1.26789948**).
2. **Amide/carbamate-like structures (N-C=O)** often contribute positively (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a high value of **2.18817183**).
3. **Heterocycles with nitrogen** (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) can increase the value (e.g., `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has **0.96786626**).
4. **Simple halogens (Cl, Br, I) or alkanes** often result in **0.0** unless paired with other functional groups.
5. **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., OH, OCH3)** can either increase or decrease the value depending on context (e.g., `CCO` has **-0.83939914**, while `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **2.10455951**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The structure **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** contains:
- A **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to an aromatic ring (increases value).
- Two **amide-like (N-C=O)** groups in a 5-membered ring (similar to hydantoin/uracil-like structures, which often increase value).
- A **fused heterocyclic system** with multiple nitrogens (likely increases value).
- No simple halogens or alkanes to drag the value down.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule resembles a combination of nitro-aromatic and heterocyclic amide features seen in higher-valued examples (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` at **2.18817183** and `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` at **1.26789948**).
- The presence of two amide groups and a nitro group suggests a value **>1.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural complexity and functional groups, the predicted value is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 1.35000000** (approximating toward the higher end due to multiple amide/nitro contributions). 

This aligns with the trend of nitro+amide combinations yielding values above 1.0 in the examples.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.1482249059225211
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **0.56586262**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.07764202**.
   - The presence of **N-N** linkages (as in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) reduces the property value compared to simple aniline.

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a **diphenylhydrazine** derivative, where two phenyl rings are connected via an **N-N** single bond (similar to hydrazine but with phenyl substituents).
   - This is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single **N-N** bond instead of a double **N=N** bond.

3. **Expected Property Trend**:
   - The **N-N** single bond in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less electron-withdrawing than the **N=N** double bond in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, so the property value should be slightly higher than **0.07764202** but lower than **0.56586262** (aniline).

### Prediction:
Given the intermediate nature of the **N-N** linkage compared to **N-H** (aniline) and **N=N** (azobenzene-like), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.25**  

(Note: This is an interpolation based on the observed trends in the data. The exact value would depend on further empirical or computational validation, but this is a plausible estimate given the examples.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.6631256504385644
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Lactams/Cyclic Amides**:  
   - Molecules with cyclic amide (lactam) structures tend to have positive property values.  
     - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** → **0.66312565**  
     - Example: **O=C1CCCN1** → **1.67064852** (higher due to smaller ring strain).  

2. **Ring Size and Substituents**:  
   - Larger rings (e.g., 6-membered) with alkyl substituents (like **CCCC1**) often show moderate positive values (~0.6–1.6).  
   - The target molecule has a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring (cyclopentane), which is sterically similar to other cyclic amides in the dataset.

3. **Symmetry and Additional Carbonyls**:  
   - The target has two carbonyls (C=O) in the 5-membered ring, which may increase the property value slightly compared to simpler lactams.  

4. **Comparison to Closest Examples**:  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (0.663) is structurally similar but has more alkyl groups, which may lower the value slightly.  
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (1.670) is simpler but has higher strain, suggesting the target's fused rings could balance this out.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the fused 5/6-ring system and two carbonyls, the value is likely **~1.2–1.4**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**1.28183238** (matching the value of **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**, which has a similar cyclic diamide motif).  

### Final Answer:  
**1.28183238**

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, we can deduce the following:

### Observations:
1. **Symmetrical halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Cl-substituted benzenes) tend to have a property value of **0.0** when they lack other functional groups or asymmetries. Examples:
   - `Clc1ccccc1Cl` (dichlorobenzene) → **0.0**
   - `Ic1ccccc1` (iodobenzene) → **0.0**
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (hexachlorodiphenylmethane) → **0.0**
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (symmetrical polycyclic aromatic) → **0.0**

2. The target molecule is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a symmetrical **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** with chlorine substituents at equivalent positions on both rings. There are no additional functional groups or asymmetries that would deviate from the trend.

3. Other halogenated or simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CC(=C)C=C`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) also default to **0.0** unless they contain polar or ionizable groups.

### Prediction:
The property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is **0.0**. This aligns with the pattern observed for symmetrical, non-polar halogenated aromatics in the provided data. 

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), we can predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a property value of **0.0**. This is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene with a long aliphatic chain.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) has a value of **0.56586262**, but it includes an amino group, which likely increases the property value.
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has a value of **1.11836185**, but this includes a nitrogen in the ring, which significantly affects the property.
   - **CCCC(=O)OC** (butyl acetate) and similar esters have values around **0.67449076**, but these are not directly comparable due to the ester functional group.
   - **CCCCCC** (hexane) is not in the dataset, but purely aliphatic chains or simple alkylbenzenes without polar groups tend to have values close to **0.0**.

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a symmetrically substituted benzene with two ethyl groups. It lacks polar functional groups (like -OH, -NO2, -C=O, etc.), which are present in many of the higher-value examples.
   - It is most structurally similar to **hexylbenzene (CCCCCCc1ccccc1)**, which has a value of **0.0**. The only difference is the length and branching of the alkyl groups, but neither has polar contributions.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since diethylbenzene is a non-polar, symmetrically alkyl-substituted benzene like hexylbenzene, its property value should also be close to **0.0**.

**Predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1: 0.0**

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 1.1952395521831125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO₂)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `-0.05862383`, `-0.83953899`). 
   - The presence of multiple nitro groups (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O`) gives a positive value (`1.15861217`), but this may depend on other substituents.

2. **Sulfonamide Group (S(N)(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule in question has a sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`), which is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro groups. 
   - This suggests the property value may be negative, like nitro-substituted aromatics.

3. **Aromatic Amines (N attached to benzene)**:
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a property value of `-0.83953899`. 
   - The molecule here is similar but replaces one `N(=O)=O` with `S(N)(=O)=O`. Sulfonamides are also strongly electron-withdrawing, so we expect a similar (negative) value.

4. **Other Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `-NO₂`, `-SO₂NH₂`) tend to have negative values unless balanced by other features (e.g., multiple substitutions or bulky groups).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = `-0.83953899`) and the presence of the similarly electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group, the property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is likely in the same range. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.839** (rounded to 3 decimal places for consistency with the examples).

### Exact Value:
Matching the precision of the examples, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.83953899** (same as the nitro analogue, since the sulfonamide is expected to have a similar effect). 

However, sulfonamides are slightly less electron-withdrawing than nitro groups, so the absolute value might be slightly smaller. A refined estimate would be:  
**-0.80** (but the closest exact match from the examples is `-0.83953899`).

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**-0.83953899** (to match the nitro-substituted analogue). 

(Note: If the sulfonamide is assumed to be less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, the value could be slightly higher, e.g., `-0.70`, but the examples do not provide a direct comparison for sulfonamides. The safest prediction is to use the nitro analogue's value.) 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.83953899**.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`), I can make the following observations:

1. **Structure of the Molecule**: The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It appears to be a derivative of tetracene or a similar structure, where the rings are fused in a linear or angular fashion.

2. **Patterns in the Examples**:
   - Molecules with simple aromatic rings or fully halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Molecules with fused aromatic systems (e.g., `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12`, `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) also have a property value of **0.0**.
   - The presence of heteroatoms, polar functional groups, or non-aromatic rings tends to shift the property value away from 0.0 (either positive or negative).

3. **Prediction for the Given Molecule**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` is a purely aromatic, fused ring system with no heteroatoms or polar functional groups. It closely resembles the examples of fused aromatic systems that have a property value of **0.0**.
   - There are no substituents or features that would suggest a deviation from this pattern.

Thus, the predicted property value for `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 2.105645013738477
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property value based on structural features and trends observed in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Key Observations from Examples:**
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br, F) or simple alkanes tend to have a property value of 0.0.
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and no polar/hydrogen-bonding groups also tend to be 0.0.
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups or other hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines) tend to have positive or negative values depending on the overall structure.
   - The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (especially -OH and C=O) often leads to non-zero values, with the sign and magnitude depending on their arrangement.

2. **Target Molecule Analysis:**
   The target molecule is:
   ```
   Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
   ```
   - It contains **four hydroxyl (-OH) groups**, which are strong hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors.
   - It has a **carbonyl (C=O) group**, another hydrogen-bond acceptor.
   - The structure includes **two aromatic rings** linked by an ether (O) and a carbonyl-containing bridge.
   - The molecule is highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding.

3. **Comparison with Similar Examples:**
   - `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a sugar with 5 -OH groups) has a value of **1.30284257**.
   - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol, 2 -OH groups) has a value of **-0.03790352**.
   - `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (multiple -OH and C=O) has a value of **-0.55846778**.
   - The target molecule has more -OH groups than most examples, but the arrangement (two on one ring, two on another, plus a C=O) suggests a balance between positive and negative contributions.

4. **Prediction:**
   Given the high number of -OH groups and the presence of a C=O, the value is likely to be **positive and moderately high**, similar to polyhydroxy compounds in the dataset. However, the aromaticity and ether linkage may slightly reduce the magnitude compared to aliphatic polyols like sugars.

   A reasonable estimate would be close to **1.0**, as seen in other multi-oxygen aromatic systems (e.g., `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23` has 1.34202004).

**Final Predicted Property Value: 1.10825153**  
*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, favoring a positive value due to the -OH/C=O dominance but slightly tempered by the aromatic ether linkage.)*

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 2.074272413756891
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, Cc1cccc(C)c1, Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0**, unless they contain functional groups or heteroatoms that influence the property.
2. **Polar or Functionalized Groups**:
   - **Esters (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC, CCCC(=O)OC)**: These tend to have a value around **0.674**.
   - **Nitro Groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O)**: These often have negative values (e.g., -0.724).
   - **Phosphorothioates (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: These can have higher positive values (e.g., 1.203).
   - **Amides (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1)**: These can have high positive values (e.g., 2.144).
   - **Hydroxy Groups (e.g., CCC(O)CC, Cc1ccc(O)cc1)**: These often have negative values around **-0.839**.
3. **Complex or Mixed Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl) can have values that are a combination of the influences of the individual groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
This molecule has:
1. A **phosphoryl group (P=O)** with an **amide linkage (NC(C)=O)** and a **thioether (SC)**.
2. The presence of **P=O** and **SC** suggests some polarity, similar to phosphorothioates in the examples (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl with value 1.203).
3. The **amide group (NC(C)=O)** may contribute a positive influence (as seen with other amides like NC(=O)c1cccnc1 with value 2.144).
4. The **methoxy group (CO-)** is neutral or slightly negative in influence.

Given these observations, the molecule is likely to have a **moderately positive property value**, similar to other phosphoryl/amide-containing compounds in the examples. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.8**, considering the combined effects of the phosphoryl, amide, and thioether groups. 

However, looking closely at similar molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **1.202**.
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **-0.839** (due to the Cl and other groups).
- The amide group here (NC(C)=O) is less conjugated than in NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (value 2.144), so its contribution may be smaller.

Thus, balancing these influences, the predicted value is likely slightly lower than 1.202 but still positive. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.75** (rounded from an estimated range of 0.7-0.8). 

However, given the variability in the examples, a more precise estimate might be **0.72**. 

But reviewing again, the closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (1.202)**, and replacing the aromatic Cl groups with simpler groups (SC and NC(C)=O) might reduce the value slightly. 

Thus, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**0.85** (accounting for the amide's slight positive boost over pure phosphorothioates). 

After reconsidering, the best match is likely **0.75**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.75**

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Simple, non-polar, and symmetric molecules (e.g., `CC1CCCC1`, `CCCC(C)C`, `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`) have a property value of **0.0**. More complex or polar molecules (e.g., those with carbonyl groups, halogens, or heterocycles) deviate from 0.0, either positively or negatively.

The molecule in question is **Cl\C=C/Cl** (trans-1,2-dichloroethene). This is a simple, symmetric, and non-polar molecule (despite the C-Cl bonds, the symmetry cancels out dipole effects). It lacks functional groups or complexity that would cause the property value to deviate from 0.0.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 1.118361854803452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic systems with heteroatoms (N, O, etc.)** tend to have non-zero property values, especially if they are polar or can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - Example: **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1** has a value of **-0.72952965** (polar amide/ester groups).
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C** has **0.60828972** (multiple polar oxygens).
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** has **1.50353691** (nitrogen-rich heterocycle).

2. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (no heteroatoms)** almost always have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Example: **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has **0.0**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (polycyclic aromatic) has **0.0**.

3. **Pyridine-like structures (6-membered N-heterocycles)**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) has **1.42428511** (due to the polar N-H bond).
   - **CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O** has **0.87223626** (polar nitro and amide groups).
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (methylated diazole) has **0.96786626**.

### Analysis of **c1ccncc1** (pyridine):
- Pyridine is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is polar due to the nitrogen lone pair but lacks additional functional groups (like -OH, -NO2, or -CO) that would significantly increase the property value in the examples.
- Compared to **CNc1ccccc1** (1.424) or **CN2C(=O)CN=C...** (0.872), pyridine is less polar but still has some polarity due to the nitrogen.
- However, the examples suggest that **simple heterocycles without strong polar groups** (e.g., **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** at **0.967**) can have moderate values.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is likely to have a **moderate positive property value**, similar to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles but lower than highly polar examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.55**  
*(This aligns with values for other N-heterocycles and avoids overestimating due to the lack of additional polar groups.)*

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.6458574089420456
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`) suggest hydrophilicity (negative contribution to the property, similar to polyols like `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with property = -0.262).
   - An ester (`COC(=O)-`) and an aromatic amide (`Nc2ccnc3...`) may add slight polarity (mixed contributions).
   - A chloro-substituted aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc23`) adds some hydrophobicity but also electronegativity.

2. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - The molecule contains two fused aromatic rings (`c2ccnc3...`) with a nitrogen heteroatom (similar to `c1ccc2cnccc2c1`, property = 1.118) and a chloro-substituted ring (similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`, property = 0.0). Heteroaromatics with nitrogen often increase the property value.

3. **Fragments from examples**:
   - The `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` fragment resembles `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = 1.349) but is less symmetric here.
   - The `Nc2ccnc3...` fragment resembles nitrogen-containing heterocycles like `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (property = 1.118).

4. **Overall balance**:
   - The hydroxyl groups and polar fragments suggest a negative or neutral contribution.
   - The aromatic nitrogen and chloro-substitution suggest a positive contribution.
   - The ester and amide are intermediate.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest matches are likely:
  - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = 1.250) for the ester + aromatic nitro (here replaced with chloro and nitrogen heterocycle).
  - `Nc2ccnc3...` resembles `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (property = 1.118).
  - The polyol part resembles `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = -0.356), but this is offset by the aromatic contributions.

### Predicted Property:
Given the competing effects, the nitrogen-containing heterocycle and aromatic ester likely dominate, placing the value in the **~1.0 to 1.3 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25**  
*(Similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` with property = 1.250, adjusted for the nitrogen heterocycle and chloro substitution.)*

Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1`, `CSSC`, `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1`) have a property value of **0.0**, while molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, halogens, etc.) deviate from 0.0, either positively or negatively.

The molecule `CCCCCO` is a simple aliphatic alcohol (1-pentanol). Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:
- `CCC(C)Cl` (a simple halogenated alkane) has a value of **0.0**.
- `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cycloheptanol) has a value of **-0.83939914**, likely due to the cyclic structure and hydroxyl group.
- `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (a branched alcohol) also has a value of **-0.83939914**.

However, `CCCCCO` is a linear alcohol, less sterically hindered than the branched/cyclic examples. Linear alcohols with small chains (e.g., `CCOC=O`, `COC=O`) have values around **0.67449076**, but these are esters, not pure alcohols. 

Given the lack of exact linear alcohol examples, but considering that:
1. Simple hydrocarbons = 0.0.
2. Polar groups (like -OH) introduce negative or positive deviations.
3. The hydroxyl group here is terminal and not heavily sterically hindered, likely leading to a moderate negative value.

A reasonable estimate for `CCCCCO` would be close to the cyclic/branched alcohols but slightly less negative due to linearity. Thus, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.3843269**  
(Similar to `CCCCC(=O)CCCC`, which is a ketone but has a comparable chain length and polarity influence.) 

If the dataset strictly enforces simple alcohols being closer to -0.839, then the value could also be **-0.83939914**, but the linearity suggests a less extreme deviation. Given the ambiguity, **-0.3843269** is a more balanced estimate.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.33019759537495713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's break down its structural features and compare them to the examples to predict the property value:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often contributing to moderate positive values (e.g., 1.118–1.148) when combined with polar groups.
2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` (1.6706) and `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (2.108), suggesting a positive contribution.
3. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Polar and electronegative, similar to phosphorothioates (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with -0.705), but context matters. Here, it's part of a cyclic system.
4. **Heterocycle (CCO1 with S=O and C=C)**: Cyclic systems with polar groups often have values between 0.5–2.0 (e.g., `c1ccncc1` at 1.118).
5. **No halogens or strongly negative groups (e.g., NO2, Cl)**: Absence of strongly electron-withdrawing groups avoids negative values.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Closest analogs**:
  - `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (2.108): Contains amide + two aromatic rings.
  - `Nc3nc(N)c2nc(c1ccccc1)c(N)nc2n3` (2.156): Multiple aromatic nitrogens.
  - `CCCOC` (2.104): Simpler but with ether linkage.

Given the **amide + aromatic ring + sulfonyl combination**, the molecule likely has a **high positive value**, similar to the above examples (range: 2.1–2.2). The sulfonyl group may slightly reduce it compared to pure amide/aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
**2.10825153**  
*(This matches the pattern of amide + aromatic systems in the examples, e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` at 2.108).*

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 2.0219708314693814
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups Present:**
   - Two ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`).
   - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to an aromatic ring.
   - An enamine-like structure (`C1=C(C)NC=`) with substitution.
   - A fused aromatic system (`c2ccccc2`).

2. **Key Observations from Examples:**
   - Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) often have negative or low positive property values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has `-0.72377934`, `CC(C)N(=O)=O` has `-0.72377934`).
   - Molecules with ester groups (`C(=O)OC`) can have positive values, especially if combined with other polar or conjugated systems (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC` has `0.67449076`).
   - Fused aromatic systems alone (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) tend to have `0.0`, but substitution can change this.
   - The presence of multiple polar/charged groups can increase the property value (e.g., `CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC` has `2.08571251` due to thiocarbonyl and disulfide groups).

3. **Comparison with Similar Examples:**
   - The molecule resembles `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (property `1.94234177`), which has a nitro-like group and fused aromatic system, but our molecule has more ester groups and less conjugation in the heterocyclic part.
   - It also resembles `CNC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1` (property `1.76356121`), which has an ester and a polar group.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The nitro group will pull the value down slightly (negative contribution).
   - The two ester groups and the conjugated system will pull the value up (positive contribution).
   - The net effect is likely a moderately positive value, similar to molecules with nitro + ester combinations in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of features, the predicted value is **~0.75979875** (similar to `CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2` which has an amide and aromatic system). 

However, considering the nitro group's stronger negative contribution, a slightly lower value is more plausible. A reasonable estimate is **~0.66312565** (similar to `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2` which has polar groups but no nitro).

Final prediction: **0.66312565** (with uncertainty due to competing effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the examples.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.6631256504385644
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a succinimide derivative but with a cyclopropane ring fused to it.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The two carbonyl groups (C=O) and the NH groups suggest moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)**: Property = 1.118. This is a polar, aromatic heterocycle with hydrogen bond acceptance. The imide here is more polar and can both donate and accept H-bonds.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (purine derivative)**: Property = 2.144. This has multiple H-bond donors/acceptors, similar to the imide here but more extreme.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (steroid-like)**: Property = -0.756. This is less polar overall despite having carbonyls, due to bulkiness.
   - **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (sugar-like)**: Property = -0.262. This is highly polar with multiple H-bonding groups, but the imide here is more constrained.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The imide structure is more polar than simple aromatics (e.g., **Clc1cccc(I)c1**, property = 0) but less polar than highly conjugated or multi-H-bonding systems (e.g., **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**, property = 2.144).
   - The cyclopropane ring adds some rigidity but doesn't significantly alter polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polarity and H-bonding capability, the property value is likely **between 0.6 and 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This aligns with similar polar, cyclic amide/imide structures in the examples (e.g., **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, property = 0.600, and **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**, property = 1.192). The value 0.85 reflects intermediate polarity and H-bonding capacity.
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns regarding the property values:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, C1CC=CC1) and simple halogenated benzenes (e.g., Clc1ccccc1) consistently have a property value of 0.0.

2. The molecule "ClCC" is a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon (chloroethane), structurally similar to other simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds that have a property value of 0.0.

3. There are no examples where a simple chlorinated alkane like ClCC has a non-zero property value in the dataset.

4. Non-zero values appear to be associated with more complex structures containing multiple functional groups, conjugated systems, or specific heteroatom arrangements.

Given these observations and the structural simplicity of ClCC, the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted property value for ClCC: 0.0**

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Halogens (Cl, Br, I):**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = 0.0 (symmetric, no polar groups)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: Property = 0.0 (symmetric, no polar groups)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Property = 0.0 (symmetric, no polar groups)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 0.0 (symmetric, no polar groups)
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: Property = 0.0 (symmetric, no polar groups)
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -0.72377934 (due to NO2 group, which is polar and electron-withdrawing)
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl**: Property = -0.83939914 (due to OH group, which is polar and H-bond donor)
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I**: Property = -0.81825578 (due to OH and CN groups, both polar)

2. **Nitro (NO2) Groups:**
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = 1.15861217 (two NO2 groups, highly polar)
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12**: Property = -0.72377934 (one NO2 group, but fused aromatic system may reduce polarity)
   - **CN(=O)=O**: Property = -0.72377934 (small nitroalkane)
   - **CCCN(=O)=O**: Property = -0.72377934 (nitroalkane)

3. **Chlorinated Aliphatic Systems:**
   - **ClCC(Cl)Cl**: Property = 0.0 (no polar groups beyond Cl)
   - **CCC(C)(C)Cl**: Property = 0.0 (no polar groups beyond Cl)
   - **BrC(Cl)Cl**: Property = 0.0 (no polar groups beyond halogens)

4. **Heterocyclic Systems with Polar Groups:**
   - **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**: Property = 0.56973588 (oxygen and nitrogen in heterocycle)
   - **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**: Property = -0.77254634 (polar C=O and NN groups)

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**
- The molecule consists of a **chlorinated pyridine ring (Clc1ccccn1)** attached to a **CCl3 group**.
- The pyridine nitrogen is polar and can act as a weak H-bond acceptor.
- The CCl3 group is electron-withdrawing but not strongly polar (no H-bonding).
- There are no strongly polar groups like OH, NO2, or C=O that would significantly increase or decrease the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -0.72377934 (due to NO2 group)
   - The target molecule lacks NO2 but has a pyridine nitrogen, which is less polar than NO2.
2. **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**: Property = 0.56973588 (heterocycle with O and N)
   - The target molecule has a pyridine (N only) and CCl3, which is less polar than the fused heterocycle above.
3. **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = 0.0 (no polar groups beyond Cl)
   - The target molecule has a pyridine nitrogen, which is slightly polar, so the property should not be 0.0.

### Prediction:
The pyridine nitrogen introduces some polarity, but the CCl3 group is not strongly polar. The property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as molecules with OH or NO2 groups. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Property = -0.35** (similar to weakly polar heterocycles like **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, which has multiple OH groups but is balanced by symmetry).

However, looking at **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = -0.72377934), the target molecule is less polar (no NO2), so the value should be closer to zero. 

Given the examples, the most likely property value is:  
**Property = 0.0** (similar to other chlorinated aromatics without strong polar groups).

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with an alcohol (OH) group attached to an aliphatic chain tends to be **-0.83939914**. This is consistently observed in the following molecules from the dataset:

- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (phenol derivative): -0.83939914  
- **CCCC(O)CCC**: -0.83939914  
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: -0.83939914  
- **CCC(C)CCO**: -0.83939914  
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: -0.83939914  
- **CCC(CC)CO**: -0.83939914  

The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is structurally similar to these examples, as it is an aliphatic alcohol (hexanol derivative). There is no conflicting evidence in the dataset for such structures deviating from this value.  

### Predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O**:  
**-0.83939914**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns regarding the property values:

1. **Simple halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `ClCCl`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that symmetric or small halogenated aromatics/aliphatics default to 0.0 unless other functional groups are present.

2. **Brominated compounds** are not explicitly in the examples, but bromine (Br) is chemically similar to chlorine (Cl) in many contexts. For instance, `CI` (iodine) also has a value of 0.0, further supporting that halogens alone (without other functional groups) default to 0.0.

3. The molecule `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1` is a symmetric dibromobenzene (1,4-dibromobenzene), structurally analogous to `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which has a value of 0.0. There are no additional functional groups or asymmetries that would deviate from this pattern.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**  

This prediction aligns with the consistent trend observed for symmetric halogenated aromatics in the provided examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns regarding the property values:

1. Fully halogenated aromatic compounds (where all hydrogens are replaced by halogens like Cl or Br) consistently have a property value of 0.0. Examples:
   - ClC(Br)Br → 0.0
   - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl → 0.0
   - Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13 → 0.0 (fully substituted with methyl groups)
   - CCBr → 0.0 (simple halogenated alkane)

2. The molecule in question: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is a fully chlorinated biphenyl derivative (all hydrogens replaced by Cl), structurally similar to the second example in the list which also had a value of 0.0.

3. Other fully substituted/halogenated/symmetrical molecules without polar functional groups or conjugated systems also show 0.0 values.

Given this consistent pattern, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is:

0.0

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.8391872143039825
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring).
2. **Phosphate ester group (OP(=O)(OR)(OR))**: Highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: Non-polar, hydrophobic groups.
4. **Bulky, branched structure**: The molecule is large and has significant steric hindrance.

### Observations from the examples:
- Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., phosphate, carbonyl, nitro, hydroxyl)** tend to have higher absolute property values (positive or negative).
- **Aromatic systems** with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, NO₂, OH) often have non-zero values.
- **Non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC=C, CCCCCCCCC)** consistently have a property value of **0.0**.
- **Phosphate-containing molecules** in the examples have relatively high positive values (e.g., **2.13034186** for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` and **2.08571251** for `CN(C)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(C)C`).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- A **phosphate group (highly polar)**.
- **Multiple aromatic rings** with methyl substituents (moderate hydrophobicity).
- **No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups** beyond the phosphate ester.

Given the examples, **phosphate-containing aromatic molecules** tend to have **positive property values > 2.0**. However, the methyl substituents may slightly reduce the polarity compared to more polar substituents (e.g., Cl, NO₂).

### Final predicted property value:
**2.10** (approximate, based on similar phosphate-containing molecules in the dataset).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given examples.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.8386431410611203
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.). The property appears to be a continuous numerical value, possibly related to logP (lipophilicity), solubility, or another physicochemical descriptor.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**

Key features:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Highly electronegative and lipophilic (likely increases the property value).
2. **Aromatic ring**: Contributes to planarity and moderate polarity.
3. **Amine group (N)**: Can act as a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor (may decrease lipophilicity slightly).
4. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Electronegative and moderately lipophilic (increase property value).
5. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: Polar and hydrogen bond acceptor (may decrease lipophilicity slightly).
6. **Heterocyclic structure**: The N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O ring introduces complexity and polarity.

### Comparison with similar molecules from the examples:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.72377934 (nitro group and Cl reduce the value).
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1**: Property = 2.18817183 (amide and aromatic ring increase value).
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**: Property = 2.1443602 (hydrogen bonding and aromaticity increase value).
- **ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl**: Property = 0.0 (highly halogenated but symmetric, no net effect).

The target molecule has a mix of lipophilic (CF3, Cl) and polar (C=O, N) groups. The CF3 group is strongly lipophilic, but the polar groups and chlorines balance this. 

### Predicted property:
Given the examples, the value likely falls between **0.5 and 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This balances the contributions of the CF3 (increases value), polar groups (decrease value), and chlorines (moderate increase). The exact value would depend on the specific weighting of these features in the underlying property model.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2678994798365715
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a property value of **1.15861217** (two nitro groups).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** has a value of **-0.38442823**, but this is more complex with other functional groups.
   - Nitro groups generally seem to increase the property value when present, especially on aromatic rings.

2. **Methoxy Groups (OCH3)**:
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** has a value of **1.34898152** (two ester groups, but methoxy is present).
   - Methoxy groups on aromatic rings often correlate with higher property values.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **-0.83939914**.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (toluene-like) has a value of **0.0**.
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) tend to increase the property, while electron-donating groups (like OH) decrease it.

4. **Specific Similar Example**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **1.15861217**.
   - Our molecule is **methoxy-nitrobenzene (COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O)**, which has one nitro group and one methoxy group.

### Prediction:
- The nitro group will contribute a positive increase (similar to the dinitrobenzene example, but less since there's only one nitro group).
- The methoxy group is electron-donating but less impactful than OH, so it may slightly reduce the effect of the nitro group.
- Given that dinitrobenzene is ~1.16, a single nitro + methoxy might be slightly lower but still positive.

Looking at other examples with single nitro or similar groups:
- **ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.72377934**, but this is aliphatic and heavily chlorinated.
- **O=Cc1ccco1** (aromatic aldehyde) has a value of **1.95076446**, but this is not directly comparable.

A reasonable estimate for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** would be slightly less than the dinitrobenzene value but still positive. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.0** (rounded from a likely range of 0.9 to 1.2 based on the examples). 

However, looking more closely, the nitro group's effect seems to dominate, and the methoxy may not reduce it significantly. A more precise estimate is **1.11836185** (same as some other nitro-aromatics like **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**).

Final answer: **1.11836185**

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aliphatic/cyclic compounds** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless other functional groups are present. Examples:
   - `ClCCCl` → 0.0  
   - `Clc1ccccc1` → 0.0  
   - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` → 0.0  
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` → 0.0  
   - `BrC(Br)Br` → 0.0  

2. **Functional groups like nitro (-NO2), carbonyl (C=O), or polar groups** often deviate from 0.0 (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → 1.158).  

3. **The given molecule is a heavily chlorinated polycyclic alkane** with no other functional groups (just C-Cl bonds and aliphatic carbons). This is structurally similar to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane), which has a property value of **0.0**.

### Prediction:
Since the molecule is **fully chlorinated with no other functional groups**, its property value is likely **0.0**, consistent with other similar halogenated aliphatics in the dataset.

**Final Answer:**  
**0.0**

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Functional Groups and Patterns**:
   - The molecule contains an ester group (**-COO-**), which is present in some of the examples (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` with a value of **1.24998994** and `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` with a value of **2.18762956**). However, these also include additional aromatic or polar substituents that likely increase their values.
   - Simpler esters or aldehydes (like **CCCOC=O**) without additional aromatic or highly polar groups tend to have values closer to **0** or slightly negative (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` with **-0.37637746**).

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Purely aliphatic molecules (e.g., `C1CCCCCC1`, `CCC#C`, `CCCCCCCCC=C`) have a value of **0.0** unless they include functional groups that significantly alter the property.
   - The propyl group (**CCC-**) in **CCCOC=O** is aliphatic, but the **-OC=O** (formate ester) introduces polarity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (phenethyl alcohol) has a value of **-0.83939914**, but this includes an aromatic ring.
   - `CC#N` (acetonitrile) has a value of **-0.23419293**, which is slightly negative due to the nitrile group.
   - The formate ester in **CCCOC=O** is less polar than a nitrile but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the lack of aromaticity or highly polar substituents (like nitro or amino groups), the value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as **-0.83939914**.
   - A reasonable estimate is close to **-0.2 to -0.4**, similar to `CC#N` but adjusted for the ester group.

**Final predicted property value for CCCOC=O: -0.3** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples' patterns.)
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, CCC1CCCCC1) and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br, CCI) typically have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with ester groups (e.g., COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C → 2.13034186, CCOc1ccccc1 → 2.10455951, CCCOC → 2.10455951) tend to have positive property values around 2.1.

3. The molecule "CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC" is an ester (specifically, decyl acetate, where a decyl group is attached to an acetate group via an ester linkage). 

Given that other ester-containing molecules in the examples have property values around 2.1 (e.g., 2.13034186, 2.10455951), and this molecule is structurally similar (long hydrocarbon chain + ester group), the predicted property value should be in this range. 

The most consistent ester value in the examples is **2.10455951** (seen in CCOc1ccccc1 and CCCOC), so this is the most reasonable prediction.

### Predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC: **2.10455951**

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7679440486943734
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (given value: 2.10455951), but with additional substitutions.
   - Phenol derivatives in the examples often have values around **-0.83939914** (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) or higher (e.g., **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: 2.10455951).

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (value: -0.38442823) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (value: -0.71621886).
   - Generally lowers the property value compared to pure aromatic systems.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (value: -0.72377934), which tends to decrease the property value.
   - Nitro groups are electron-withdrawing and often correlate with negative values.

4. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**:
   - Chlorine is present in many examples, but its effect depends on context. In **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, it leads to a high value (2.10455951), but combined with other groups, the value may decrease.

5. **Overall polarity and conjugation**:
   - The molecule is highly conjugated and polar due to the phenol, amide, and nitro groups. This likely reduces the property value compared to simpler aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccccc1**: 0.0).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (value: -0.38442823) has an amide and phenol/chloro-substituted aromatics. Our molecule is more polar due to the nitro group, so we expect a lower value.
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (value: -0.72377934) has a nitro group and chloro-substitution, similar to part of our molecule.
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (value: -0.71621886) is a simpler amide-substituted aromatic.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of the phenol, amide, nitro, and chloro groups, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.7 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate is close to **-0.72377934** (similar to **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**) or slightly lower due to the additional amide group.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.7714413**  
*(This aligns with the trend observed for nitro- and amide-containing aromatic systems in the examples.)*

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2.0712944631334507
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `c1ccccc1`), halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`), and molecules with no polar or functional groups that stand out.
   - Symmetrical or non-polar molecules tend to have a property value of 0.0.

2. **Property ≈ 0.66312565**: 
   - Seen in cyclic structures with amide/carbonyl groups (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C`).

3. **Property ≈ -0.83939914**: 
   - Molecules with hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups attached to aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C`, `CCCC(C)CO`, `CCCO`).
   - Also seen in heavily halogenated phenols (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`).

4. **Property ≈ 1.50353691**: 
   - Heterocyclic nitrogen-containing molecules (e.g., `COc1ncnc2nccnc12`, `COc2cnc1ncncc1n2`).

5. **Property ≈ 1.67064852**: 
   - Acetamide derivatives with chloro-substituted phenyl rings (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`).

6. **Property ≈ 0.58904123**: 
   - Phosphorothioate esters with chloro-substituted phenyl rings (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

- It contains **two phosphorothioate (`P(=S)(OC)`) groups** linked via a **thioether (`S`) bridge** between two phenyl rings.
- This is structurally similar to the example `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = 0.58904123), but with a more complex, symmetrical structure.
- The presence of two `P(=S)(OC)` groups and the `S` bridge suggests a higher contribution to the property than the single `P(=S)(OC)` group in the example.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = 0.58904123) but with an additional `P(=S)(OC)` group and symmetry, the property value is likely **slightly higher**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.75** (rounded from an estimated value between 0.7 and 0.8 based on the additional contribution of the second `P(=S)(OC)` group). 

However, since the examples show that doubling functional groups doesn't always linearly increase the property, and symmetry can play a role, the closest match from the examples is still **0.58904123**. 

Thus, the predicted property is:  
**0.58904123** (same as the most similar example). 

### Final Answer:
**0.58904123**
==================================================
Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5501650613936735
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The presence of a nitro group often leads to higher property values, especially when combined with other polar or aromatic groups. For example:
     - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of **1.26789948**.
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.72377934**, but this is likely due to the lack of additional polar groups or substitution effects.
   - The nitro group is highly electron-withdrawing and can significantly influence the property.

2. **Hydroxy Group (OH)**:
   - The hydroxy group is polar and can contribute to the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic ring. For example:
     - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` has a value of **0.56952375**.
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **-0.83939914**, but this is likely due to the dominance of the halogen effects.

3. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with multiple substituents (especially polar or electron-withdrawing groups) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(Cl)ccc23` has a value of **2.18554085** (due to multiple polar groups and aromaticity).
     - `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` has a value of **0.0**, as halogens alone may not significantly affect the property.

4. **Combination of OH and NO2 on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both a hydroxy group and a nitro group on the same aromatic ring. This combination is similar to:
     - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (value = **1.26789948**), but without the chloro substituents.
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (value = **-0.72377934**), but with an additional hydroxy group.

### Prediction:
The presence of both a hydroxy group and a nitro group on the aromatic ring will likely result in a property value between **0.5 and 1.3**, leaning toward the higher end due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group and the polar hydroxy group. 

Given the similarity to `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (value = **1.26789948**), but without the chloro substituents (which may slightly reduce the value), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.8** (approximate, likely between 0.7 and 1.0). 

However, looking more closely at `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (value = **0.56952375**), which has a polar amide and hydroxy group, and considering that the nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than the amide, the value for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` might be slightly higher. 

Thus, a more precise estimate would be:

**Final predicted property value: 0.75** (interpolating between similar examples). 

But since the nitro group is very strong, it could push the value higher, closer to **0.9**. 

Given the examples, the most consistent estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.8**. 

However, to match the precision of the given examples, let's round to **0.8** or **0.75**. 

Given that `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` is **0.56952375** and `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` is **1.26789948**, the unsubstituted version (`Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) would likely be around **0.8-0.9**. 

Thus, the final answer is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**. 

But to be more precise, let's say **0.8** (as a midpoint between the similar examples). 

Given the data, the most reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.8**. 

However, looking back at `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.72377934) and adding the OH group, the value should increase significantly, so **0.8** is reasonable. 

Final answer: **0.8**. 

But to match the format of the given examples (many decimal places), let's say **0.80000000**. 

However, since the exact value isn't derivable without a model, the best estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.8**. 

Given the examples, the closest match is **0.8**. 

Thus, the predicted value is:

**0.8**. 

But to be more precise, interpolating between similar examples, it is likely **0.75 to 0.85**, so **0.8** is a reasonable midpoint. 

Final answer: **0.8**. 

However, looking at `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (0.56952375) and `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (1.26789948), the unsubstituted version would be closer to **0.9**. 

Thus, the most accurate prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.9**. 

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.9**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.9**

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.2668811029996192
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (a sugar derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages, which are highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (especially -OH) and no aromaticity or halogens tend to have negative or moderately positive property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `-0.26217934`).
- The presence of multiple -OH groups and ether linkages in sugars suggests significant polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, similar to some of the more negative or moderately positive values in the dataset.

Given the structural similarity to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but with even more -OH groups and a larger, more branched structure, the property value is likely to be negative but not extremely so, as the additional -OH groups would increase polarity but also add complexity. 

**Predicted property value: `-0.35`** (approximate, based on the trend for highly polar, non-aromatic, hydrogen-bonding molecules in the dataset). 

This is an educated estimate given the lack of explicit examples of large sugars in the training data, but it aligns with the observed trends for polar, non-aromatic molecules.
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Alkynes and Simple Hydrocarbons**: 
   - The molecule **CCCCCCCC=C** (1-octene) has a property value of **0.0**, which suggests that simple unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) default to **0.0** unless other functional groups are present.
   - The molecule **CCCC(=O)C** (2-pentanone) has a value of **-0.3843269**, but this includes a carbonyl group, which is not present in **CCC#C**.
   - The molecule **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene) has a value of **-0.43837184**, but this includes two nitrile groups, which are not present in **CCC#C**.

2. **Lack of Functional Groups**:
   - **CCC#C** is a terminal alkyne with no other functional groups (like -OH, -Cl, -NO2, etc.), which are the primary contributors to deviations from **0.0** in the dataset.
   - Other simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**, **Fc1cccc(F)c1**, **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32**) all default to **0.0** when no strongly polar or ionic functional groups are present.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since **CCC#C** is a neutral, non-polar hydrocarbon (just an alkyne), its property value is most likely **0.0**, consistent with other simple unsaturated hydrocarbons in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCC#C**: **0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.6954342921340326
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Group**: 
   - The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property value of **0.58904123**.
   - The presence of **P=S** seems to contribute positively to the property value, especially when combined with other functional groups (e.g., aromatic rings, halogens).

2. **Aromatic Chloro-Substitution**:
   - Molecules with multiple chloro-substitutions on aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) often have a property value of **0.0**, but when combined with other polar groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**), the value increases significantly (**1.7715234**).

3. **Ethoxy Group (CCO-)**:
   - The molecule **CCCCOCCCC** (which includes an ether linkage) has a high value (**2.10455951**), suggesting that alkoxy groups can contribute positively.

4. **Combined Features**:
   - The target molecule has:
     - A **P=S** group (like the first example, contributing ~0.58).
     - Three **Cl** atoms on an aromatic ring (like some examples with 0.0, but here combined with P=S and ethoxy).
     - An **ethoxy (CCO-)** group (similar to the high-value ether example).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of **P=S**, **aromatic Cl-substitution**, and **ethoxy group**, the property value is likely elevated compared to simple chloro-aromatics but not as high as purely alkoxy-dominated structures. 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.8 to 1.2**, based on:
- The **P=S** contribution (~0.58).
- The **ethoxy** and **chloro-aromatic** synergy (adding ~0.2–0.6).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.95** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.7725463447747488
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `C=C`, `CC(C)C`, `CCCCBr`)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they have specific functional groups or heteroatoms.
2. **Aromatic systems with simple substituents (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Clc1ccccc1Cl`)**: These often have values around **0.56586262** or **0.0**, depending on the substituents. Halogens (Cl, Br, F) alone often result in **0.0**, while amines (`N`) or amides (`C(=O)N`) can increase the value.
3. **Amides and complex nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`)**: These tend to have higher positive values (e.g., **2.18817183**).
4. **Hydroxy or carbonyl groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C`, `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1`)**: These can lead to negative or moderately positive values (e.g., **-0.83939914** or **0.67449076**).
5. **Complex heterocycles or conjugated systems (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`)**: These often have intermediate positive values (e.g., **0.47317726**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, which consists of:
- A pyridine ring (`c1nccc`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide group).
- The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is a strong hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor and is polar, similar to amides or other nitrogen-rich groups.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (amine + halogen): **0.56586262**
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (amide + aromatic): **2.18817183**
- `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (nitrogen-rich heterocycle + carbonyl): **0.92613215**

The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is more polar and hydrogen-bonding than a simple amine but less bulky than a tertiary amide. The pyridine ring also contributes to polarity. Given this, the value is likely to be **positive and moderate**, similar to other nitrogen-containing polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **0.92613215**, similar to `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (another nitrogen-rich heterocycle with a carbonyl group). 

### Final Answer:
**0.92613215**

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.5890412310860947
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)`):** This is a notable functional group, similar to `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` in the examples, which has a property value of `-0.70510435`.
2. **Amide group (`C(=O)N`):** This is present in many of the examples, often contributing to non-zero property values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` has a value of `1.79269978`).
3. **Aliphatic chains (`CCC`, `CCCCC`):** These are common in molecules with property values of `0.0` unless paired with other functional groups.
4. **Thioether linkage (`SCC`):** This is less common in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups often contribute to non-zero values.

### Comparison to examples:
- The molecule most closely resembles `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` (property `-0.70510435`), which also has a phosphorothioate group and aromatic substitution. However, our molecule lacks the nitroaromatic group and instead has an amide and aliphatic chains.
- The presence of the amide (`C(=O)N`) and the phosphorothioate (`P(=S)`) suggests a moderate property value, likely between `0.5` and `1.5`, as seen in similar functionalized molecules (e.g., `CCOC(=O)N` has `1.24998994`).
- The aliphatic chains may slightly reduce the absolute value compared to more polar/aromatic examples.

### Predicted property value:
Given the combination of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, the property value is likely in the range of `0.7` to `1.3`. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: `1.0`** (rounded from an inferred value close to examples like `CCOC(=O)N` or `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` but adjusted for structural differences). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify a pattern in the property values:

1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H atoms) with no functional groups or rings** consistently have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45` (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `ClCCBr` (simple halogenated alkane) → 0.0
   - `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclohexane derivative) → 0.0
   - `CCCC/C=C/C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon) → 0.0
   - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (alkyl-substituted cycloalkane) → 0.0

2. The molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane) is a simple linear hydrocarbon with no functional groups, rings, or unsaturation. 

Thus, following the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC` is:

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 2.1703152902131277
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, I can make the following observations to predict its property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Steroids/Ketones with Multiple Rings**: 
   - Molecules like **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **1.87506867**) and **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property: **1.15151681**) have similar fused ring structures with ketone (=O) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. These tend to have **positive property values** (often > 1.0).
   - The presence of **=O** and **-OH** groups in polycyclic systems correlates with higher positive values.

2. **Impact of Functional Groups**:
   - **Ketones (=O)** and **alcohols (-OH)** in fused rings increase the property value.
   - **C#C (alkyne)** is present in the target molecule but not prominently in the examples. Its effect is unclear, but it may slightly increase the value due to polarity.

3. **Similarity to Given Examples**:
   - The target molecule closely resembles **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property: **1.15151681**), but with an additional **-OH** and **C#C** group. This suggests a **higher value** than 1.15151681.
   - It also resembles **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **1.87506867**), but with fewer ketone groups and an alkyne.

4. **Other Trends**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CCCCCCC1**, **CCC1CCCCC1**) have **property = 0.0**.
   - Polar or conjugated systems (e.g., **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2**) have positive values (~0.9-1.9).

### Prediction for Target Molecule:
The target molecule has:
- A fused tetracyclic steroid-like structure.
- One ketone (=O) group.
- Two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.
- One alkyne (C#C) group.

Given its similarity to **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property: **1.15151681**) but with additional polar groups, I estimate its property value to be **~1.5**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1.5** (approximate, likely between 1.3 and 1.7 based on structural analogs).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.7590910644722578
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some observed trends:

1. **Aromatic systems without polar or charged substituents** (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically neutral, non-polar hydrocarbons.

2. **Polar or charged substituents** (e.g., `-OH`, `-Cl`, `-NO2`, `-SO2NH2`, `-COO`, `-N`, `-O`, etc.) introduce non-zero values, either positive or negative, depending on their electronic effects. For example:
   - Phenols with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`) tend to have negative values (~ -0.839).
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) often lead to positive values (~ 1.158).
   - Amides, sulfonamides, and other polar functionalities can contribute to higher positive or negative values.

3. **Complexity and multiple functional groups** can lead to additive or competing effects. For instance:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F`) have higher positive values (~ 2.108).
   - Sugars or polyols (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`) have moderate positive values (~ 0.620).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (`-OCH3`) and hydroxyl (`-OH`) substituents**: These are polar and likely contribute negatively (similar to `Oc1ccccc1Cl` with -0.839).
2. **Lactone or cyclic ester (`COC2=O`)**: This is a polar group that may contribute positively.
3. **Sugar-like polyol structure (`OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`)**: This is highly polar and could contribute a moderate positive value (~0.6-0.7).
4. **Fused ring system with ether linkages (`OCOc5cc67`)**: This adds complexity but may not drastically change the value.

### Prediction:
Given the mix of polar groups (some contributing negatively, others positively) and the overall complexity, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. 

A reasonable estimate, based on similar molecules in the examples, is:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.663**  

This aligns with molecules like `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (0.663) or `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (0.620), which have multiple polar groups but no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating extremes.

### Final Answer:  
**0.663**
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with a phenol (Oc1ccccc1) core tends to be around **0.55016506** when substituted with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., NO2 in `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`). 

For the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, where chlorine (Cl) is also an electron-withdrawing substituent (though less strongly than NO2), the property value is likely similar to the nitro-substituted phenol. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:  
**0.55016506**  

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where halogenated or nitro-substituted phenols have this value.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.7597987525001713
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=C or aromaticity, which often contribute to non-zero values).
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Present in multiple positions. In the examples, heavily chlorinated molecules (e.g., ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) have a property value of **0.0**, but these are symmetric/perchlorinated. Here, the Cl is asymmetrically placed, which may deviate from 0.
3. **Amide group (OC(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 (property = 1.67064852) and FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O (property = -0.83864314). The amide tends to contribute significantly (either positive or negative).
4. **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: Similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (property = 0.0), but here the substitution is less symmetric.
5. **Ether linkage (O)**: Present in molecules like COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (property = 1.34898152), which suggests a positive contribution.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: Contains amide, Cl, and aromaticity; property = -0.83864314.
- **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1**: Contains amide, ether, and aromaticity; property = 0.75979875.
- **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**: Contains amide-like group and Cl; property = -0.75293801.

### Prediction:
The molecule has a mix of features that could push the property in either direction:
- The alkyne is uncommon, but the amide and ether suggest a positive contribution.
- The Cl substituents may dampen the effect but not necessarily to 0 (due to asymmetry).
- The closest analogs (e.g., CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1) suggest a value between **0.7 and 1.2**.

Given the presence of the **OC(=O)N** group (similar to the molecule with property = 0.75979875) and the additional alkyne/Cl, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than 0.75 but less than 1.2.

### Final predicted property value:
**0.85** (plausible range: 0.8–1.0)

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.7516388510560401
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phenol-like fragment (OC attached to benzene with Cl substituent)**: Similar to molecules like `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` (property = 2.10455951) and `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (property = -0.03790352). The presence of Cl and O suggests some polarity.
2. **Pyrimidine-like heterocycle (c2cncnc2)**: Similar to `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (property = -0.71627489) or `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (property = -0.51148682), which tend to lower the property value due to hydrogen bonding or polarity.
3. **Chlorinated benzene (c3ccccc3Cl)**: Similar to `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (property = 0.0), but here it's part of a larger conjugated system.
4. **Overall conjugation and substitution**: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings with polar substituents (Cl, O) and a heterocycle, suggesting moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Observations from Examples:
- Molecules with **multiple Cl substituents** (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl`) tend to have **property = 0.0**, but this is likely due to symmetry or lack of strong polar interactions.
- Molecules with **O and N in conjugated systems** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12`, property = -0.72958269) often have negative values.
- **Phenol derivatives** with Cl (e.g., `COc1cccc(Cl)c1`) have high positive values (2.10455951), but this is likely due to the methoxy group's effect.
- The **pyrimidine-like fragment** (c2cncnc2) may pull the value downward due to its similarity to nitrogen-rich heterocycles with negative values.

### Balancing the Effects:
- The phenol-Cl fragment might contribute a positive value (but less than 2.104 due to no methoxy).
- The pyrimidine-like fragment may contribute a negative value (around -0.5 to -0.7).
- The additional Cl-substituted benzene may slightly reduce the overall polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the competing effects, the property is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This balances the polar contributions from the O and N atoms with the Cl substituents' effects.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains with Polar Groups**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a property value of **0.67449076**.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has a property value of **-0.3843269**.
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C** (2-nonanone) also has a value of **-0.3843269**, suggesting that aldehydes and ketones of similar chain length may share this value.

2. **Ethers and Esters**:
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1** (an ether with an aromatic ring and polar groups) has a value of **0.17881077**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...** (a complex ester) has a high value of **1.69997581**, but this is likely due to the complexity and multiple functional groups.

3. **Aldehyde Functional Group**:
   - The presence of **C=O** (aldehyde) in **CCCCCC=O** gives **-0.3843269**.
   - The molecule **CCCCOC=O** is **butyl formate**, which is an ester (not an aldehyde), but structurally similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate, value **0.67449076**).

4. **Ether + Carbonyl**:
   - The **COC=O** (ester) group in **CCCCOC=O** is analogous to **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, not in the examples but similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC**).

### Prediction:
The molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate) is structurally similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate), which has a value of **0.67449076**. Both are esters with a 4-carbon aliphatic chain. 

However, **CCCCOC=O** is a formate (HCOOR), while **CCCC(=O)OCC** is a butyrate (RCOOR'). Formates might have slightly different properties due to the smaller carbonyl group, but the examples don't include direct comparisons. Given the lack of exact matches, the closest analog is **CCCC(=O)OCC**, so we can predict a similar value.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **~0.67449076** (same as **CCCC(=O)OCC**). 

However, if we consider that **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has **-0.3843269** and **CCCC(=O)OCC** has **0.67449076**, the ester group seems to increase the value compared to the aldehyde. Thus, **CCCCOC=O** (another ester) should likely be in the same range as **CCCC(=O)OCC**.

**Answer: 0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. Simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClCCCl, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, CCBr, C1Cc2ccccc2C1) consistently have a property value of **0.0** when they contain only carbon, hydrogen, and halogens (Cl, Br) without any other functional groups.

2. The molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane) fits this pattern perfectly - it's a simple halogenated alkane with no other functional groups.

3. Other examples like CCCC (butane), C=CCCC=C (1,4-pentadiene), and CCCC1CCCC1 (butylcyclopentane) which contain only C and H also have 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is: **0.0**

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

1. **Aromatic rings with hydroxyl (-OH) groups** tend to have property values around **-0.0379** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` and `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC`).  
2. **Methyl-substituted aromatic rings with a single -OH group** (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`) have a value of **-0.83939914**, but this also includes branched aliphatic chains.  
3. The molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (toluene derivative with a hydroxyl group), structurally similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` but without the branched aliphatic part.  

Given that:  
- Phenol derivatives with -OH alone tend toward **-0.0379**.  
- Additional alkylation (methyl groups) may slightly decrease the value (as seen in `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`).  

However, since `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` has **two methyl groups** but no additional bulky aliphatic chains, its value is likely closer to the phenol baseline than the heavily alkylated case.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.03790352** (same as `Oc1cccc(O)c1` due to the dominant influence of the aromatic -OH group).  

This aligns with the trend where hydroxylated aromatics without strong electron-withdrawing or bulky groups cluster around this value.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, we can deduce the following:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatic systems** consistently have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain additional polar or charged functional groups (e.g., NO₂, OH, etc.). Examples:
   - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl → 0.0  
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl → 0.0  
   - Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br → 0.0  
   - ClCBr → 0.0  

2. The target molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with no additional functional groups (just Cl substituents on both aromatic rings). This matches the pattern of halogenated aromatics with no other contributing moieties.

### Conclusion:
The predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is:  
**0.0**  

This aligns with the consistent trend observed for similar halogenated aromatic systems in the provided data.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (only C and H) without functional groups or unsaturation beyond a single double bond tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32`, `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1`, `CCCCCCCC`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`).

2. Molecules with a single isolated double bond (like `CCCCCCCCC=C`) also tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

3. The molecule `CC=C(C)C` is a simple hydrocarbon with a single isolated double bond (isobutene). It has no functional groups or additional unsaturation that would contribute to a non-zero property value in the context of the given examples.

Thus, based on the observed trends, the predicted property value for `CC=C(C)C` is:

**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. Simple alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons without functional groups (e.g., CCCC1CCCC1, C=CCCC=C, c1ccc2c3c(ccc2c1)c4cccc5cccc3c45) typically have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with halogen atoms (Cl, F) but no other functional groups often have 0.0 (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl).

3. The molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane) is a simple halogenated hydrocarbon with no other functional groups. Based on the pattern observed in similar molecules:

- CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) would be analogous to ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl which has 0.0
- Other simple chlorinated hydrocarbons in the examples also show 0.0

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is: 0.0

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to the examples to predict its property value.

The molecule in question is: **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**

This is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring. Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property: -0.83939914)  
   This is almost identical to our molecule, just with a slightly different chlorine substitution pattern (2,4,6-trichlorophenol vs. our 2,3,5-trichlorophenol).

2. **O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23** (property: 2.09676389)  
   This is quite different structurally and functionally.

3. **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** (not in examples, but similar core)  
   Simple phenols without chlorine tend to have different properties.

Given that the closest structural analog is **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** with a value of -0.83939914, and our molecule differs only in the position of one chlorine (which doesn't significantly alter the electronic or steric properties in this context), we can reasonably predict a similar value.

Additionally, other highly chlorinated or halogenated compounds like:
- **OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (-0.83939914)
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (-0.83939914)
- **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.83939914)
- **CC(C)CC(C)O** (-0.83939914)
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (-0.83939914)

show that this value (-0.83939914) is associated with halogenated or sterically hindered/aliphatic alcohol/phenol structures.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is:  
**-0.83939914**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.7590910644722578
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is highly complex with multiple functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls, and cyclic structures), which suggests a higher property value. 

Here’s the breakdown:
- The molecule has multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls), which often increase the property value (e.g., sugars and polyols like `OCC(O)CO` have values > 1.5).
- It also contains fused ring systems and cyclic ethers, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `O=c2[nH]c1CCCc1c(=O)n2C3CCCCC3` has a value of 1.981).
- The presence of glycosidic linkages (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) is reminiscent of carbohydrate-like structures, which tend to have moderate to high values.

Given these observations, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.0**. A reasonable estimate is **1.75**, balancing the contributions from the polar groups and structural complexity. 

**Final predicted value: 1.75** (approximate, based on analogous examples).

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.10657626216212344
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Cl, Br)** alone (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`, `ClC(Br)Br`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless combined with other polar/ionic groups.
   - **Amides, thioamides, or heterocycles with N/O/S** often have intermediate values (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` = 1.67064852, `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` = -0.51148682).
   - **Tert-butyl groups (`C(C)(C)C`)** appear in molecules with moderately negative values (e.g., `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` = -0.83215056).
   - **Thiocarbonyl (C=S)** or **sulfur-containing groups** (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)`) elevate the property value.

2. **Target Molecule Analysis**:
   - **Structure**: `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` contains:
     - A **thioether (C-S-C)** linkage.
     - A **triazole-like heterocycle** with **N and C=O** (amide-like).
     - A **tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`)**.
     - A **secondary amine (NH)**.
   - Analogous examples:
     - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = -0.83215056) shares the tert-butyl and heterocyclic N/O/S motifs.
     - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (property = -0.51148682) has a similar N-rich heterocycle but lacks sulfur.

3. **Impact of Sulfur**:
   - The **thioether (S)** in the target molecule is less polarizing than a **thiocarbonyl (C=S)**, so it won’t elevate the value as much as `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (1.67064852).
   - The **tert-butyl group** and **amide-like (C=O/NH)** groups suggest a negative value, but the **S** moderates this.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the **tert-butyl group** (pushing toward negative values) and the **thioether/heterocycle** (slightly positive influence), the closest match is:  
**-0.46934008** (similar to `CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1`).  

However, the presence of sulfur and the exact heterocycle may adjust this slightly.  

**Final Prediction**:  
**-0.51629858** (matching the trend of `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1`).

**Answer**: The predicted property value for `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` is **-0.51629858**.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`), I can predict the property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Ester Groups**: 
   - `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` has a property value of **2.13034186**. This molecule contains an aromatic ring with ester-like substitutions (though more complex).
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` has a property value of **1.85615733**. This is also an aromatic ring with an ester group (`CCOC(=O)`) and additional polar substituents.
   - The molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is simpler, with just an ethyl ester (`CCOC(=O)`) attached to a benzene ring.

2. **Simpler Aromatic Esters**:
   - The presence of an ester (`CCOC(=O)`) directly attached to an aromatic ring tends to give property values in the range of **0.6 to 2.1**, depending on additional substituents.
   - Since `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` has no additional polar or functional groups (just a plain phenyl ring), its value should be on the lower end of this range.

3. **Comparison to Other Simple Cases**:
   - `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (ethyl hexanoate, aliphatic ester) has a value of **0.67449076**.
   - `CCCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl pentanoate, aliphatic ester) also has a value of **0.67449076**.
   - Aromatic esters (like the one in question) typically have slightly higher values than aliphatic esters due to conjugation effects.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate) and its similarity to aliphatic esters (but with aromatic conjugation), its property value should be slightly higher than **0.67449076** but lower than the more complex aromatic esters like **1.85615733**.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.8 to 1.2**. Looking at the examples, the closest simple aromatic ester is not explicitly listed, but a plausible interpolation suggests:

**Predicted property value: 0.95** (approximate, based on trends). 

However, since the exact match isn't in the training data, this is an educated guess. If forced to pick a specific value from the trends, I'd lean toward **0.95**, but acknowledge some uncertainty. 

(Note: If this property is logP or a similar metric, the value aligns with expectations for an aromatic ester.) 

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional reasoning?

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Alkanes (e.g., CI, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1)**:
   - These molecules consistently have a property value of **0.0** when the halogen (Cl, Br, I) is attached to an alkyl or aromatic carbon without other functional groups.
   - Example: **CI** (iodomethane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - Example: **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.0**.

2. **Alkanes and Simple Alkyl Halides**:
   - Simple linear or branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(=C)C(=C)C**, **CCCCCCC=C**) also have a value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups that influence the property.
   - Alkyl halides like **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane) are analogous to these examples, as they lack other functional groups.

3. **Functional Groups that Affect the Property**:
   - The property deviates from **0.0** when the molecule contains polar or conjugated functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, amino, hydroxyl, etc.).
   - For example, **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (benzamide) has a value of **-0.71621886** due to the amide group.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a simple linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane) with no other functional groups.
- It is structurally similar to **CI** (iodomethane) and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene), which both have a property value of **0.0**.
- The presence of the bromine atom alone does not appear to influence the property value in the absence of other functional groups or conjugation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the examples, **CCCCCCCBr** should have a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CO** (methanol, if interpreted as CH3OH, or carbon monoxide if interpreted as C≡O). Given the context, I'll assume it's methanol (CH3OH), as carbon monoxide is a small, inorganic molecule and doesn't fit the pattern of the other examples.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes (e.g., CCC, CC1=CCCCC1, Cc1ccccc1)** tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they have functional groups.
2. **Alcohols (e.g., OC1CCCCCC1, CCC(C)CO, OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O)** tend to have negative property values, often around **-0.83939914** (e.g., OC1CCCCCC1, CCC(C)CO) or more negative if more hydroxyl groups are present (e.g., OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O has a value of 1.30284257, but this is a sugar with multiple -OH groups and likely other effects).
3. **Methanol (CH3OH)** is a simple alcohol with one -OH group, similar to CCC(C)CO (isobutanol) or OC1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexanol), which both have a value of **-0.83939914**.

### Prediction for CO (methanol):
Given that methanol is a simple alcohol like the others mentioned above, its property value is likely **-0.83939914**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.83939914**
