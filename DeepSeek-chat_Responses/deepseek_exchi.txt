SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.7551473960638355
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - `CC=C`: -0.946
     - `CCCC`: Not given, but `CCCCCC`: -0.548
     - `CCCCCC(C)C`: -0.237
     - `CCCCCCCC(C)O`: 0.103
   - The property value increases (becomes less negative) as the chain length increases.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (`COOR` or `(=O)OC`)**: 
     - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is a long-chain ester (decyl acetate analog). 
     - Similar esters in the examples:
       - `CCCCCC(=O)OC`: Not given, but `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is longer.
       - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC...`: 10.444 (very high, but this is a complex sugar-like ester).
       - `CCOC(=O)CC`: -0.671 (shorter ester).
     - The property value seems to increase with chain length for esters.

3. **Direct Comparison**:
   - The closest example is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (decyl acetate-like), which is longer than `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (not given) but shorter than `COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC...` (10.444). 
   - Another similar example is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (not given directly, but `CCCCCC(=O)OC` would likely be ~0.5-1.0 based on trends).

4. **Trend**:
   - For esters, the property value increases with chain length. 
   - `CCCCCC(=O)OC` might be ~0.5-1.0, so `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (longer chain) would likely be higher.

### Prediction:
Given the trend and the examples, the property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is **1.81193603** (this matches the value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the provided examples, which is likely the same or very similar molecule). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is **1.81193603**.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3791152644729596
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** scaffold (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl group and NH). This is a polar, aromatic heterocycle with potential hydrogen-bonding capability (NH and C=O).
2. **Substituents**: A **chlorine atom** is attached to the benzene ring, which adds lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing character.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of the **C=O and NH** groups suggests moderate polarity, similar to some of the given examples with amide/carbonyl functionalities (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1...).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with **chlorine substituents + polar groups** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, property = 1.360) tend to have values > 0.
- **Heterocycles with C=O/NH** (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O), property = -0.804) can have negative values, but the aromaticity and chlorine here may offset this.
- The **benzofuran-like core** is somewhat analogous to fused aromatic systems like **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property = 0.636), but with more polarity.

### Key Observations:
1. The **chlorine** and **aromaticity** likely push the value above 0.
2. The **polar C=O/NH** might reduce it slightly compared to purely lipophilic chlorinated aromatics.
3. Similar molecules in the examples with **Cl + polar groups** have values in the **0.5 to 1.5 range**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of **chlorine (lipophilicity/EWG)**, **aromaticity**, and **polar C=O/NH**, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: ~0.85**  

This aligns with the trend of chlorinated polar aromatics in the examples (e.g., 1.360 for a more chlorinated system, 0.220 for a less polar one). The specific value **0.85** reflects the intermediate polarity and substitution pattern.  

---
**Final answer:**  
**Predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2: 0.85**

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.820211913946483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups** (e.g., nitro, nitroso, amide, etc.) often contribute negatively to the property value unless they are part of a larger conjugated system or complex structure.
   - Example: `Nc1nccs1` (thiazole derivative) = -0.68169825  
     `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (fluorinated uracil derivative) = -0.73252439  
     `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` (cyclic urea) = -0.59102254  

2. **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** appear in the dataset with negative contributions:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (nitroimidazole derivative) = -0.37105057  

3. **Alkyl groups** (e.g., `CC`, `CCC`) tend to have small negative contributions unless balanced by other features (e.g., rings, halogens, or conjugation).

4. **Simple nitroalkanes** (like `CC(C)N(=O)=O`) are not explicitly in the dataset, but analogous compounds suggest:
   - The nitro group dominates the property value, pushing it negative.
   - The isopropyl group (`CC(C)`) is less influential than the nitro group.

### Prediction:
Given the nitro group's strong negative influence and the lack of compensating features (e.g., conjugation, rings, or halogens), the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** should be **negative and moderately sized**, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the dataset.

Comparing to `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-0.37105057), which has a nitro group attached to a heterocycle, our molecule is simpler (no heterocycle), so the value might be slightly more negative.

### Final predicted value:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on analogous examples).  

*(Note: Without a clear regression model or more exact matches, this is an educated estimate.)*

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 12.09160812450607
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and functional groups, particularly the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O), aromatic systems, halogens, and other polar or bulky substituents. The property values tend to increase with larger, more complex structures, especially those with multiple rings, conjugated systems, or multiple functional groups.

Let's analyze the target molecule:
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

1. **Structure**: This is a steroid-like molecule with multiple fused rings (4 rings total, including a cyclohexane and cyclopentane). It has:
   - Two carbonyl groups (C=O): one in a ring (likely a ketone) and one as part of a terminal aldehyde-like group (C(=O)CO).
   - A hydroxyl group (OH).
   - Significant rigidity and bulk due to the fused ring system.

2. **Comparison to examples**:
   - The highest values in the examples (e.g., 10.70049755 for **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**) are for similarly complex steroid-like structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups.
   - The target molecule is very similar to this high-value example but has an additional polar group (OH) and a slightly less extended conjugated system.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The presence of two carbonyl groups and a hydroxyl group in a fused ring system suggests a high property value, likely in the range of 8-12.
   - Given the similarity to the example with value 10.70049755 but with slightly less conjugation, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower.

**Predicted property value: ~9.5**  
(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. The value is likely between 9 and 10.) 

For higher precision, the exact property being modeled would need to be clarified (e.g., logP, solubility, binding affinity, etc.), but the fused-ring carbonyl systems consistently show high values in the given examples.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.5533518583379722
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) in the given examples tend to have property values in the range of -0.5 to -0.2 (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.535, Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.230).
2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (C(=O)NC(=O)N). Similar functional groups (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -0.417) suggest a slight negative contribution.
3. **Halogen Substituents**: Fluorine and chlorine substituents are present. Fluorinated aromatics (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.602) tend to lower the property value more than chlorinated ones.
4. **Polarity and Conjugation**: The conjugated system with amides and aromatic rings may slightly increase the property value compared to simpler halogenated aromatics.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.535 (dichlorobenzene)
- **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**: -0.602 (trifluoromethylbenzene)
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**: -0.417 (thiourea-linked aromatic)
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: -0.491 (dichlorophenol)

Given the additional amide linkages and fluorine substituents, the property value is likely slightly higher (less negative) than a simple halogenated aromatic but still negative due to the polar halogens and amides.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45**  

This balances the effects of the fluorinated ring, amide groups, and chlorinated ring. The value is less negative than FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 (-0.602) due to the extended conjugation and amide linkages but more negative than simple chlorinated aromatics like Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.535). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.45**

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.5564173707858278
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular features. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Ethers**: 
   - Simple alkanes or ethers with no polar or functional groups tend to have negative or near-zero property values. 
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) has a value of **-0.17220643**.
   - Example: `CCCCCO` (linear alcohol) has a value of **-0.65665073**.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ester) has a value of **-0.67146136**.

2. **Ether Group Impact**:
   - The presence of an ether group (`O` in the chain) does not significantly increase the property value unless combined with other polar or bulky groups.
   - Example: `CC1CCCO1` (cyclic ether) has a value of **-0.66005667**, similar to simple alcohols or alkanes.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branching (e.g., `C(C)C`) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains, but the effect is small unless combined with other features.

### Analysis of **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a branched ether with a propyl group (`CCC`) and an isopropyl group (`C(C)C`) connected by an oxygen (`O`). 
- It lacks strongly polar or functional groups (like `OH`, `C=O`, `Cl`, etc.) that would significantly increase the property value.
- It is structurally similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)C` (value: **-0.17220643**) but with an ether linkage, which may slightly reduce the property value due to increased polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is expected to be slightly negative, similar to other simple ethers or branched alkanes. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the range observed for similar molecules in the examples.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.6810580638568827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (uracil-like) ring** with substitutions:
   - A **bromine (Br)** atom attached to the ring (electron-withdrawing, increases polarity).
   - A **methyl (C)** group and a **tert-butyl (CCC(C))** group attached to the ring (moderate hydrophobicity).
   - Two **carbonyl (C=O)** groups (polar and hydrogen-bond acceptors).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **Br** and **C=O** groups suggests moderate polarity (similar to some of the examples with halogens and polar groups).
   - The **tert-butyl group** adds some hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar groups.
   - The molecule is **not as large or complex** as the high-value examples (e.g., steroids or multi-ring systems with values >10), but it is more polar than simple aromatic or aliphatic compounds.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property: -0.3688): A simple chlorinated benzene (low value due to small size and symmetry).
- **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (property: 0.4651): A polycyclic aromatic with an amine (moderate value due to size and polarity).
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (property: 2.4400): A polar, multi-functionalized aromatic system (higher value due to NO₂ and C=O groups).
- **CCC(C)CCO** (property: -0.6924): A simple aliphatic alcohol (low value due to lack of polarity/aromaticity).

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- Moderate polarity (Br, C=O).
- A small but functionalized heterocycle.
- No extreme hydrophobicity or large conjugated systems.

Given these features, its property value is likely **between 0.5 and 1.5**, closer to the middle of this range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This is based on its balance of polar groups (Br, C=O) and hydrophobic substituents (tert-butyl), placing it in the lower-middle range of the polar examples.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.09866057817518414
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl). Similar molecules with fused or connected aromatic rings in the dataset include:
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a high value of **6.14030235**.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system with an amine group) has a value of **1.88298841**.
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative with methyl groups) has a value of **-0.01711057**.

2. **Simpler Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted aromatic system) has a value of **0.63072987**.
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a cyclohexane fused to a benzene ring) has a value of **-0.11662692**.

3. **Biphenyl vs. Naphthalene**: 
   - Biphenyl is less conjugated than naphthalene but more conjugated than two isolated benzene rings. The value is likely between the simpler aromatic systems and the fused polycyclic systems.

### Prediction:
Given that biphenyl is less conjugated than naphthalene but more extended than a single benzene ring, its property value should be moderately higher than simple aromatic systems but lower than highly fused systems. 

From the examples:
- The methyl-substituted aromatic system has **0.63072987**.
- The naphthalene derivative has **-0.01711057**.
- The fused aromatic system with an amine has **1.88298841**.

Biphenyl lacks substituents or heteroatoms, so its value should be closer to the simpler aromatic systems but slightly higher due to the extended conjugation. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl) is approximately **0.75**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being measured.)

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6218225410924839
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), which is a simple aliphatic thiol with a linear carbon chain and a terminal sulfur (thiol) group.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)C`, `CCC1CCCCC1`) tend to have **low or negative property values** (around -0.2 to -0.6).
2. **Polar or functionalized groups** (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -Br, -NO2, -S(=O)=O) can increase the property value, especially if multiple are present.
3. **Sulfur-containing molecules**:
   - `CC(=O)NC(=O)NC(=O)C(C)CC` has a value of -0.278.
   - `CCNC(=S)NCC` has a value of -0.445.
   - Thiols or sulfides are not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur tends to moderately increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- It is a simple thiol with no additional functional groups or complexity.
- Compared to similar-sized hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` with -0.684 or `CCCCCC(C)C` with -0.502), the thiol group (-SH) will slightly increase the property value due to its polarity.
- However, it is not as polar or complex as molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, or aromatic systems).

### Estimated property value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCS** would be around **-0.4 to -0.5**. 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**-0.45** (similar to `CCNC(=S)NCC` but slightly higher due to the simpler structure). 

### Final answer:

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.44607158917844475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.64703192
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (more branched alkane): -0.17220643
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -0.51350838
   - **CC/C=C\C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -0.77137404
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (branched alcohol): -0.40568688
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (branched alcohol): -0.57968853

   Branched alkanes tend to have negative values, and the presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) slightly increases the property value (less negative).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **-OH groups**: Generally increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC** is -0.40568688 vs. **CCC(C)(C)C** at -0.64703192).
   - **-Cl, -Br, -F**: Halogens tend to decrease the property value (more negative), especially with multiple halogens (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl**: -0.78408166).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Increase the property value (less negative or positive) compared to aliphatic chains.

3. **Specific Examples Similar to CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: -0.40568688 (branched alcohol with 7 carbons, -OH on tertiary carbon).
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: -0.57968853 (branched alcohol with 6 carbons, -OH on secondary carbon).
   - **CCCC(C)(C)C**: Likely similar to **CCC(C)(C)C** (-0.64703192) but with a longer chain (slightly less negative).

### Prediction for CCCC(C)(C)CO:
- This is a branched alcohol with a primary -OH group and a tert-butyl group (7 carbons total). 
- Compared to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.40568688), the -OH here is primary (less steric hindrance), which might slightly increase the property value (less negative). 
- Compared to **CC(C)CC(C)O** (-0.57968853), this has a longer chain and a more branched structure, which might offset the primary -OH effect.

Given these comparisons, the property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is likely between -0.40 and -0.60. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (closer to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** due to similar branching but adjusted for primary -OH). 

### Final Answer:
- **CCCC(C)(C)CO**: **-0.45** (approximate prediction based on structural trends).

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.21770443935824235
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, **c1ccccc1**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., **-0.77674475** for benzene).
   - Substitution with alkyl groups (e.g., methyl) slightly increases the property value (e.g., **-0.57546362** for **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** vs. **-0.77674475** for benzene).
   - Fused aromatic rings (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to have higher (less negative) values than single rings. For example:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** has a value of **-0.01396625**.
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex fused system) has a value of **0.63072987**.

2. **Effect of Methyl Substitution**:
   - Adding a methyl group to an aromatic system typically increases the property value by ~0.1–0.2 compared to the unsubstituted version. For example:
     - **c1ccccc1**: **-0.77674475**
     - **Cc1ccccc1**: ~**-0.53** (not in examples, but inferred from trends).
     - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: **-0.57546362**.

3. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (1-methylnaphthalene). Comparing to similar structures:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (2-methylnaphthalene): **-0.01396625**.
     - **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (unsubstituted naphthalene): Not in examples, but likely ~**-0.3 to -0.1** based on trends.
     - The methyl group in **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (1-position) is unlikely to drastically change the value compared to the 2-methyl isomer.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The 2-methylnaphthalene (**Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**) has a value of **-0.01396625**,
- The 1-methylnaphthalene (**Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) is structurally very similar, with the methyl group in a slightly different position but not significantly altering the electronic or steric properties,

the property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** should be **close to the 2-methylnaphthalene value**, perhaps slightly lower (more negative) due to the less sterically hindered position of the methyl group.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1: -0.05**  
(Approximately between **-0.10** and **0.0**, likely closer to **-0.01396625** but slightly more negative). 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.05** (rounded to two decimal places). 

If more precision is needed, **-0.045** would align well with the trend. 

However, based on the closest analog (**Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** at **-0.01396625**), the value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is likely:  
**-0.02 to -0.03**. 

For consistency with the given data, I would predict:  
**-0.025**. 

But since the examples show **-0.01396625** for the 2-methyl isomer, the 1-methyl isomer might be:  
**-0.02**. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**-0.02**. 

However, given the variability in the examples, a safe range is **-0.03 to 0.0**, with **-0.02** as the best point estimate.

**Predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1: -0.02**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic structure with two amide (N-C=O) groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.23212192**.
   - The core is polar and moderately hydrophilic due to the amide groups.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **bulky alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**. 
   - The **C(C)CCC** group adds significant hydrophobicity, while the **CC=C** group is slightly less hydrophobic than a saturated alkyl chain.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (-0.23212192), but the given molecule has a longer/bulkier alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC instead of just C). This will increase hydrophobicity slightly.
   - Other molecules with cyclic amides or polar groups (e.g., **c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2c(O)cccc2**, property = 0.39872446) have higher values, but this is offset by the bulky alkyl group here.
   - The **CC=C** group is less hydrophobic than a fully saturated chain (e.g., **CCCC**, which would push the value lower).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the balance between:
- The polar hydantoin core (tending to increase the property value),
- The bulky alkyl group (tending to decrease it), and
- The vinyl group (less hydrophobic than alkyl),

the property value should be **slightly lower** than the analogous **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (-0.23212192) due to the increased hydrophobicity of C(C)CCC.

### Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.35** (rounded to two decimal places). 

This accounts for the increased hydrophobicity of the substituents while retaining the polar core's influence.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.602104593335677
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccccc1** derivatives) tend to have low or negative property values unless they have additional complex functional groups or large substituents.
2. Halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** with -0.285, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** with 2.678) show moderate values, with higher values for more halogen substitutions.
3. The trifluoromethyl group (**CF3**) is electronegative but not as bulky or polarizable as heavy halogens like iodine or multiple chlorines.

Given this, **trifluoromethylbenzene** is less complex than heavily halogenated examples but more polar than simple hydrocarbons. Its property value is likely **between 0 and 1**, closer to the lower end due to limited substitution. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.25** (similar in magnitude to **CNC(=O)Oc1ccc(N(C)C)c(C)c1**, which has moderate polarity but no heavy halogens). 

However, since the CF3 group is less impactful than multiple halogens, a slightly lower value may be more accurate.  

**Final predicted property value: 0.137** (close to the range of simpler halogenated aromatics like **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** but accounting for CF3's weaker effect).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on trends in the data.)*

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.32355633401280975
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular properties such as **logP (partition coefficient)** or **aqueous solubility (logS)**, as the values range from negative (more hydrophilic) to positive (more hydrophobic). The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol derivative (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Highly hydrophilic molecules** (e.g., polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, which is glycerol-like) have **negative property values** (e.g., `-0.35480017` for that molecule).
2. **Hydrophobic molecules** (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds) have **positive property values**.
3. The presence of multiple hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups strongly favors negative values due to high hydrophilicity.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
- The molecule is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, a cyclic polyol with **5 hydroxyl groups** and an ether linkage. This is even more hydrophilic than the linear polyol example (`OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, value `-0.35480017`).
- Cyclic structures may slightly reduce hydrophilicity compared to linear ones, but the dominance of `-OH` groups will still drive the property value to a **similar or more negative range**.

### Predicted property value:
Given the examples, I predict the property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** to be:  
**`-0.45`** (slightly more negative than the linear polyol example due to the high density of `-OH` groups). 

This aligns with trends in the data where increasing hydrophilicity (more `-OH` groups) correlates with more negative values.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 16.486430290305584
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as ring systems, halogenation, and conjugation. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The presence of acetyl (CC(=O)) and ketone (C=O) groups tends to increase the property value, especially when conjugated or part of a complex system.
2. **Steroid-like polycyclic framework**: The molecule has a multi-ring system resembling steroids or terpenes, which are associated with higher property values in the examples (e.g., **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2** has 1.33, and **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has 9.01).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: These can slightly reduce the property value, but their effect is secondary to the dominant influence of the polycyclic framework and carbonyls.
4. **Conjugated double bonds (C=CC=O)**: This further increases the property value due to extended conjugation.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has a property value of **14.88020125**. This is very structurally similar to the query molecule, with a nearly identical polycyclic backbone and carbonyl groups. The main difference is the additional **C=O** and **OH** groups in the query molecule, which may slightly modify the value.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **9.00708742**, but it lacks some of the additional carbonyls and conjugation seen in the query.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (14.88) and the additional polar/conjugated features, the property value is likely in the same range but slightly higher due to the extra carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. 

**Predicted property value: ~15.5**  
*(A reasonable estimate would be between 15.0 and 16.0 based on the examples.)*  

### Exact prediction: **15.2**  
*(This accounts for the slight increase due to the additional C=O and OH groups while staying close to the 14.88 reference.)*

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 8.607729146358425
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Steroid-like framework**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O**, which has a value of **5.06853283**). This suggests a moderately high property value due to its size and rigidity.
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - A ketone (**C=O**) group, which is polar but not as impactful as highly polar or charged groups.
   - A hydroxyl (**OH**) group, which adds polarity but is balanced by the hydrocarbon framework.
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and polycyclic, similar to **OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7** (value: **49.96945895**), though less conjugated and without aromatic nitrogen heterocycles. This suggests a lower value than 49.96 but still significant.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (value: **5.06853283**) is a closer match in size and functionality (hydroxyl + polycyclic), but our molecule has an additional ketone and slightly more complexity.
- **OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7** (value: **49.96945895**) is much more conjugated and has aromatic systems, so our molecule should be far lower.

### Predicted Value:
Given the steroid-like structure with **C=O** and **OH** groups, the property value is likely in the range of **5 to 10**, leaning toward the higher end due to the additional ketone. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 6.5**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, assuming the property scales with molecular complexity and polarity.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3026473592414943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CC(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 1.027) and `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 0.979). These suggest that acetamide groups tend to contribute positively to the property (values > 0).
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in many molecules, often with negative contributions (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` = -0.663), but when combined with other polar/aromatic groups, the effect can vary (e.g., `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` = -0.513).
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The para-substituted benzene ring with acetamide and nitro groups introduces polarity and conjugation, which may increase the property value compared to simpler nitroaromatics.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 0.979) has a similar nitro-aromatic-acetamide motif but with a more complex heterocycle. Our molecule is simpler but retains the key features.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 1.027) has an acetamide group but lacks the nitro group, yet still has a moderately positive value.

3. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - The conjugation between the acetamide and nitro groups via the aromatic ring likely increases the property value compared to non-conjugated or less polar molecules.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both acetamide and nitro groups on an aromatic ring, the property value is expected to be **positive and moderate**, similar to the examples above. A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (0.979) due to the simpler structure but higher than `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (1.027) due to the nitro group's additional effect.

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (approximate, based on structural analogy).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a computed descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 19.55515253249693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a moderately polar and bulky group. Similar phosphorus-containing groups in the dataset (though none are exact matches) suggest contributions to the property value in the range of **0.5 to 2.0** when combined with other features.
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC)**: The sulfur-carbon bond adds some polarity but is less influential than the phosphorus group.
3. **Chlorinated benzoxazole ring (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The benzoxazole core (fused aromatic ring with O and N) is polar and aromatic, similar to some heterocycles in the dataset (e.g., `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` with **-0.434** or `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` with **1.623**).
   - The **Cl substituent** on the aromatic ring is electron-withdrawing. Cl-substituted aromatics in the dataset (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` with **-0.185**, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` with **-0.373**) tend to lower the property value slightly, but the effect is modulated by other groups.
4. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as influential as the phosphorus or aromatic systems.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analogs in the dataset are molecules with **combined aromatic systems, heteroatoms, and polar substituents**:
  - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (property = **3.378**) has a thiophene and aromatic rings with polar groups.
  - `CCCCNC(=O)n1c(NC(=O)OC)nc2ccccc12` (property = **2.375**) has a urea-like linkage and aromaticity.
  - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = **2.689**) has multiple Cl substitutions but lacks phosphorus.

Given the **phosphorothioate group's contribution** (likely increasing the value) and the **chlorinated benzoxazole's moderate polarity**, the property value should be **higher than simple Cl-substituted aromatics** but **lower than highly conjugated or multi-functionalized molecules** like the steroid examples (~6–17).

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is:  
**2.8 ± 0.5**  

### Final Answer:
**2.8**

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.7406427834075449
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)** generally have negative property values unless they are part of a larger or more complex structure. For example:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -0.15628049  
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.80090966  
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: -0.17747252  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: -0.35480017  

2. **Branching** tends to reduce the property value further (more negative). For example:
   - **CCC**: -0.88323941 (simple linear alkane)  
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.80090966 (branched alcohol)  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched than **CC(C)CO**, so we expect a slightly more negative value.

3. **Steric hindrance** (e.g., tert-butyl group) may further decrease the property value. Compare:
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.80090966  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol derivative): Likely more negative due to increased branching.

### Prediction:
Given that **CC(C)(C)CO** is a highly branched alcohol (tert-butanol derivative), its property value should be more negative than **CC(C)CO** (-0.80090966) but not as extreme as very small molecules like **CCC** (-0.88323941).  

A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.85 and -0.90**.  

### Final predicted value:
**-0.87** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the given examples).  

This aligns with the trend of increased branching leading to more negative values while staying within the range observed for similar alcohols.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.5972228841276804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule is a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (resembling purine-like structures but with carbonyl and NH groups). 
   - Similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F**, property = -0.73252439) and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1**, property = -0.75564481) are also nitrogen-rich heterocycles with polar groups (C=O, NH). These have negative property values in the range of **-0.73 to -0.75**.
   - The presence of multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (NH, C=O) and aromatic nitrogens suggests high polarity, which correlates with negative values in the dataset.

2. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - **Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2** (property = -0.38600374): Less nitrogen content but similar fused aromatic system.
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.39401562): Another nitrogen-rich heterocycle with a methoxy group, showing a moderately negative value.
   - The given molecule lacks alkyl or bulky substituents (which often increase the property value, e.g., **CCCCOC(=O)CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCCC**, property = 8.073307).

3. **Trends**:
   - Small, polar, nitrogenous heterocycles tend to have negative property values.
   - The additional fused ring and carbonyl group in **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** may further lower the value compared to simpler heterocycles like **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1**, but with increased complexity and polarity, the property value is likely slightly more negative than these examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: -0.78**  

This aligns with the trend that more polar, hydrogen-bonding heterocycles with no hydrophobic substituents exhibit lower (more negative) values in the dataset.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8042836084713485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate, with the structure CH₃-COO-CH(CH₃)), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple esters and small oxygen-containing molecules** (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O) tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.0** when they contain polar or functionalized groups.
2. **Small aliphatic molecules with minimal polarity** (e.g., CCC(C)(C)C, CC(C)O) have **negative values** (around -0.6 to -0.9).
3. **Molecules with carbonyl (C=O) groups** (e.g., CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C) can have higher values if they are part of complex structures, but simple esters like methyl acetate are less extreme.
4. **Methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O)** is a small ester with moderate polarity due to the C=O and ether (O) groups. Comparing it to similar-sized polar molecules in the dataset:
   - CCOC=C (an ether) has a value of **-0.845**.
   - CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 (a more complex ether/amide) has **-0.021**.
   - COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (an aromatic aldehyde ether) has **-0.535**.

Given that methyl acetate is more polar than simple ethers but less polar than highly functionalized molecules, its value should lie between the simple ethers (~-0.8) and the more polar examples (~0.5). A reasonable estimate is **slightly negative or near zero**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.45**  
*(This is based on its intermediate polarity, smaller size, and comparison to similar molecules in the dataset.)*

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.47732415474993334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (i.e., **N,N'-diphenylurea**). Ureas often exhibit moderate polarity due to the carbonyl (C=O) and NH groups.
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2) are present, which are non-polar but can contribute to conjugation and slight polarity.
3. **Polarity**: The C=O and NH groups introduce hydrogen-bonding capability, which typically lowers the property value (as seen in other polar molecules in the dataset).
4. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, which may reduce its overall polarity compared to asymmetric polar molecules.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol with Cl): Property = -0.6319 (polar due to OH and Cl).
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (carbamate): Property = -0.0873 (less polar than phenol).
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (nicotinamide): Property = -0.6618 (polar due to CONH2).
- **c1ccncc1** (pyridine): Property = -0.8066 (highly polar due to N).

The urea group here is less polar than a phenol or pyridine but more polar than a simple aromatic ether. The symmetric diphenyl substitution reduces polarity further compared to asymmetric polar groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar urea core and the non-polar phenyl rings, the property value is likely **moderately negative**, similar to other amide/urea-like structures but less extreme than highly polar molecules. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property = -0.35**  

This aligns with:
- Less polar than phenols (-0.6 range) but more polar than simple aromatic ethers (~-0.1 to -0.2).
- Symmetry and lack of highly electron-withdrawing groups prevent extreme values.  

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**-0.35**

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.1990289702579145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a rigid, planar structure and significant aromatic character.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules like `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (property: 1.60790108) and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (property: 1.3668369) are also polycyclic aromatic systems. Fluorene is smaller and less conjugated than the first example but similar in aromaticity to the second.
   - The presence of fused rings tends to increase the property value compared to single-ring aromatics (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1` would likely have a lower value).

2. **Rigidity and Planarity**: 
   - Fluorene is rigid and planar, similar to other fused aromatics in the dataset. This suggests its property value will be higher than flexible or non-aromatic molecules.

3. **Substituents**: 
   - Fluorene has no polar substituents (e.g., -Cl, -OH, -NO2), which often increase the property value in the dataset. Its value will likely be lower than halogenated or functionalized aromatics.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the examples:
- `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (larger PAH): 1.60790108  
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (hexachlorinated biphenyl): 1.3668369  
- `c1ccccc1` (benzene, not in dataset but inferred to be lower): likely ~0.  

Fluorene is intermediate in size/conjugation between benzene and larger PAHs. Its value should be **slightly lower than the hexachlorinated biphenyl (1.3668369)** but higher than single-ring aromatics.

### Prediction:
**Predicted property value for fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13): ~1.2**  
(Approximate range: 1.1 to 1.3 based on the dataset trends.)  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities and the given examples. The property could relate to logP, polarizability, or another descriptor.)*

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.5506374516847926
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (basic, polar).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (polar, hydrogen-bonding).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar due to multiple hydrogen-bonding groups (NH, SO2, NH2).
   - It is not very large (smaller than many high-value examples like steroids or long alkanes).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**, value = 5.699) tend to have higher values, but this is a phosphorothioate, which is bulkier.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (value = -0.444) is a smaller cyclic amide, less polar than our molecule.
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (value = 0.871) is a chlorinated biphenyl, less polar but larger.
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (value = 0.226) has nitro and heterocyclic groups, somewhat similar in polarity.

4. **Expected Property**:
   - The sulfonamide and guanidine groups will increase the property value compared to simple aromatics or small alkanes.
   - The aromatic ring with NH2 adds polarity but is not as bulky as some high-value examples (e.g., steroids or long chains).
   - Likely in the range of **0.5 to 2.0**, similar to other polar, mid-sized molecules in the dataset.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is:  
**1.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity to the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.8671640619638965
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups, which are highly polar and electron-withdrawing. In the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.62775889`, but when combined with other features, nitro groups can contribute to higher values like in `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` with `2.44004407`).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strong electron-withdrawing group, similar to halogens like Cl or Br, which often increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl` has `0.48695481`).
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: Amines can contribute to polarity, but the effect depends on substitution. Here, it's a bulky tertiary amine, which may not drastically increase the value.
4. **Aromatic ring with substitutions**: The benzene ring is heavily substituted with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, which will significantly increase the property value due to their combined electron-withdrawing effects.
5. **Alkene (CC(C)=C)**: This is a minor contributor compared to the other groups.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (value: `2.44004407`), which has a nitro group, halogen substitutions, and a complex heterocycle. Our molecule has two nitro groups and a CF3 group, which are even more electron-withdrawing.
- Another similar example is `CCC(=C(CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2` (value: `2.66930183`), which has polar groups but lacks nitro/CF3. Our molecule's nitro/CF3 combination is likely more impactful.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of two nitro groups and a CF3 group, along with the aromatic system, the property value is expected to be **higher than 2.44004407** but not as extreme as very large or steroid-like molecules (e.g., ~20). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted value: 2.85**  

This accounts for the additive effects of the nitro and CF3 groups while considering the bulky amine slightly offsetting the increase.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8042836084713485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -Cl, -N, -O-)** tend to have higher (less negative) property values.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O**, **c1ccccc1**) have more negative values.
   - The presence of **esters (e.g., -COO-)**, **amides**, or **aromatic systems with electronegative substituents** increases the property value.

2. **Molecular Size and Branching**:
   - Larger or more complex molecules (e.g., **CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2**) tend to have higher values.
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)O**) slightly reduces the property value compared to linear analogs.

3. **Specific Examples for Comparison**:
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide): **-0.94514184**  
     (Contains polar amide but small size → very negative)
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): **-0.38406413**  
     (Ester group → moderately negative)
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): **-0.71480085**  
     (Polar -OH but small/branched → quite negative)
   - **CC(C)SC(C)C**: **-0.25735287**  
     (Less polar than oxygen analogs → less negative)

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is **isopropyl formate** (an ester: **R-O-CO-H**).
- It has:
  - A polar ester group (**-OC=O**), which increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
  - Branching (**CC(C)-**), which slightly reduces the value.
- Similar molecules:
  - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): **-0.38406413**  
    (Linear ester, slightly higher than branched ester)
  - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): **-0.71480085**  
    (Less polar than ester → lower value)

### Prediction:
Given that **CC(C)OC=O** is a branched ester, its value should be:
- Higher (less negative) than **CC(C)O** (**-0.71480085**) due to the ester group.
- Lower (more negative) than **CC(=O)OCC** (**-0.38406413**) due to branching.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.50** and **-0.60**.  

### Final Prediction:
**-0.55** (specific value: **-0.55000000**)  

This aligns with the trend where branched esters have moderately negative values, less polar than linear esters but more polar than alcohols.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.535417881009983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring with:
   - Two methyl groups (**C**) at positions 1 and 3 (meta to each other).
   - A hydroxyl group (**O**) at position 4 (para to one methyl and meta to the other).
2. **Polarity/Functional Groups**:
   - The hydroxyl group (**-OH**) introduces polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   - The methyl groups (**-CH3**) are weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (property: -0.3885): This has multiple hydroxyl groups and an ester, making it more polar. Our molecule has only one hydroxyl and is less polar.
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** (property: 1.5229): This is a non-polar polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Our molecule is more polar due to the hydroxyl group.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (property: -0.7484): Phenol, with one hydroxyl group. Our molecule is similar but with additional methyl groups, which slightly reduce polarity.

### Key Observations:
- The hydroxyl group dominates the property value, pulling it toward negative values (like phenol, -0.7484).
- The methyl groups are weakly hydrophobic, offsetting the polarity slightly (less negative than phenol).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) are present to push the value higher.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar hydroxyl and the weakly hydrophobic methyl groups, the property value should be slightly less negative than phenol but more negative than highly substituted non-polar aromatics. 

**Estimated value: -0.55** (between phenol's -0.7484 and less polar examples like COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1 at -0.3885).

### Refinement:
Looking at **CCc1ccccc1C** (property: -0.3899), a dialkyl benzene with no polar groups, and **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (property: 0.6466), a phenol with a long alkyl chain, our molecule is closer to phenol but with less polarity due to the methyl groups. 

Thus, a more precise estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.60** (closer to phenol but adjusted for the methyl substitutions).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is **-0.60**.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 5.889114067377353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragments tend to have higher property values (e.g., 4.01979966 to 32.66799891). The presence of additional substituents (e.g., halogens like Cl, Br, I) increases the value further.
   - Example:  
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **4.01979966**  
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **5.02840833**  
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **5.83265494**  
     - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` → **32.66799891** (larger alkyl chains and additional functional groups).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - The property value increases with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) or bulky substituents on the aromatic ring.
   - Example:  
     - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → **1.3668369** (multiple Cl substituents).  
     - `Brc1cccc2ccccc12` → **0.02087862** (less substituted than the above).

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The molecule has a **SC** (thioether) substituent on the aromatic ring. This is less electron-withdrawing than halogens but may still contribute to a moderate increase in the property value.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The closest analog in the examples is `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property = 4.01979966).  
   - Replacing the **Cl** with **SC** and **C** (less electron-withdrawing) would likely reduce the property value slightly but keep it in a similar range due to the **P=S** core.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the **P=S** group and the moderately electron-donating **SC** and **C** substituents (compared to halogens), the property value should be slightly lower than the **Cl**-substituted analog but still significant. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: ~3.5**  
(Expected range: 3.0 to 4.0, based on the examples).  

### Final Answer:
**3.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the given examples).

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.952686501444337
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine substitution), aromaticity, and the presence of multiple fused rings or bulky substituents. 

The molecule in question is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a highly chlorinated biphenyl derivative with two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each heavily substituted with chlorine atoms. 

### Key observations from similar examples:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** tend to have higher property values:
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **2.67890972**  
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **3.58127337**  
   (This is even more chlorinated and has a higher value.)

2. The given molecule has **6 chlorine atoms** (similar to the first example above but with a slightly different substitution pattern). 

3. The **biphenyl scaffold** adds some complexity, but the property seems dominated by the degree of chlorination.

### Prediction:
The molecule is less chlorinated than `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (which has 8 Cl atoms and a value of 3.58) but more chlorinated than `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (which has 6 Cl atoms and a value of 2.68). 

Given the symmetrical substitution and biphenyl structure, I predict a value **between 2.68 and 3.58**, likely closer to the lower end because the chlorination is not as extreme as the 3.58 example. 

### Final predicted value:
**~2.95** (interpolating between the two closest examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, solubility, toxicity, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7990917444403222
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes**: Small alkanes (e.g., **CC**, **CCC**) have low property values (around -0.88 to -0.52).  
   - Example: **CC** = -0.944, **CCC** = -0.883.  
   - Adding more carbons slightly increases the value (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC** = 0.082).  

2. **Functional Groups**:  
   - **Nitro groups (NO2)**: Nitro groups tend to increase the property value, but the effect depends on the rest of the molecule.  
     - Example: **N(=O)=O** (standalone nitro) is not present, but in **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene), the value is -0.348, suggesting nitro groups alone don't always increase the value significantly.  
     - However, **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (a complex nitroaromatic) has a high value (2.600), indicating nitro + aromaticity + other groups can boost it.  
   - **Polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O, Cl, Br)**: Generally increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.  

3. **Nitroalkanes**:  
   - The given molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** is a simple nitroalkane (1-nitropropane).  
   - Comparing to similar small polar molecules:  
     - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) = -0.574.  
     - **CC(=O)C** (acetone) = -0.892.  
     - **CCBr** (bromoethane) = -0.310.  
   - Nitroalkanes are more polar than simple alkanes but less polar than highly conjugated nitroaromatics.  

4. **Trend for Nitroalkanes**:  
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and polar, so it should increase the property value compared to propane (**CCC** = -0.883).  
   - However, it’s not as dramatic as in nitroaromatics or multi-functionalized molecules.  

### Prediction:
Given that:  
- **CCC** = -0.883 (propane).  
- Adding a nitro group (**NO2**) will increase the value, but likely not beyond 0 (since even **CCCCCCCCC** = 0.082).  
- Similar polar small molecules (e.g., **CCOC=O** = -0.574, **CCBr** = -0.310) suggest nitropropane would fall in the range of **-0.5 to 0**.  

A reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.4 to -0.2**.  

Looking at the examples, the closest analog is **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene) = -0.348, but nitropropane is less conjugated, so it might be slightly lower.  

### Final Prediction:  
**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: -0.35**.  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5240828504208642
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often have negative property values, but the magnitude depends on other structural features.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **-0.39647216**, while **BrC(Br)Br** has **-0.38493416**.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - Simple halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**) tend to have values around **-0.4 to -0.5**.
   - The presence of additional functional groups (e.g., NO2, OCH3) can shift the value slightly.

3. **Fluorine vs. Other Halogens**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl/Br, but its effect on the property is similar in the given examples (no drastic difference is observed).

4. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine substitution seems to have a slightly less negative effect than chlorine (compare **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.396) with **Clc1ccc(Cl)c1** (not given, but similar structures suggest comparable values)).

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- This is a simple aromatic ring with **F** and **Br** substitutions, similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.396) and **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (-0.521).
- Fluorine is slightly more electronegative than chlorine, but the property value is likely to be in the same range as other halogenated aromatics.
- The presence of both F and Br may lead to a value slightly more negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but less negative than **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (which has an additional OCH3 group).

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.42** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the examples, though exact prediction would require a more rigorous model or additional data.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.23143161173141066
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkyl Halides/Alcohols**: 
   - Small, non-polar or slightly polar molecules (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, CC(C)(C)CO) tend to have negative property values (typically between -0.2 and -0.8).
   - The presence of halogens (Br, Cl) or oxygen (OH) slightly increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons but keeps it negative.

2. **Complexity and Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple rings, conjugated systems, or polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, sulfonyl) tend to have higher positive values. For example:
     - CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O → 8.59 (very high due to sulfonamide, carbonyl, and aromatic rings).
     - CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO → 22.05 (steroid-like structure with multiple rings and polar groups).

3. **Ring Systems**:
   - Simple rings (e.g., CC1CCCO1) have negative values (~-0.66).
   - Fused or bridged ring systems with polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) increase the value. For example:
     - CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 → 8.60 (bridged ring with carbonyl and aromatic groups).
     - CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO → 13.74 (complex polycyclic with multiple polar groups).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is a **bicyclic system** with:
- Two fused rings (a cyclohexane and a cyclopentane).
- Two tertiary methyl groups (sterically bulky).
- One hydroxyl group (polar).

This structure is somewhat similar to the following examples:
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property = 13.74), but our target lacks the additional carbonyl, fluorine, and more polar groups.
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property = 8.60), but our target is simpler with only one hydroxyl group.

Given the presence of a fused ring system and a hydroxyl group, the property value should be **positive but lower than the highly polar/complex examples**. 

### Prediction:
For **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **1.0 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate is **1.8**, considering the balance between the bicyclic structure and the single hydroxyl group.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1.8**

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 6.294245028094351
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples, especially focusing on similar substructures and functional groups.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: 
   - This is a prominent feature, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, which has a property value of **28.02989825**. 
   - The presence of **P(=S)** with two **OCC** groups is highly polarizable and contributes significantly to the property value.

2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**:
   - This is a cyclic amide (lactam) fused to a benzene ring, similar to the structure in the molecule with the high value (28.02989825). 
   - The conjugation and rigidity of this group also contribute to the property.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecule**:
   - The only difference between this molecule and the one with the value **28.02989825** is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**. 
   - The lactam ring is slightly less polarizable than the **SC(CCl)** group, but the overall impact is still significant because the **P(=S)** and aromatic systems dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the molecule with the property value **28.02989825**, but with a slightly less polarizable substituent (lactam vs. thioether), the predicted value should be slightly lower but still in the same high range. 

**Predicted property value: ~26.5** (estimated based on structural similarity and expected reduction due to the less polarizable group). 

However, since the examples show that the **P(=S)** group dominates the property value, and the lactam is still highly conjugated, a more precise estimate would be closer to the original high value but slightly reduced. 

**Final predicted value: 27.2** (interpolating between the given high-value example and the structural differences).

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is approximately **27.2**.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.137768330673563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core with a **1,4-dione** (two carbonyl groups) and two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring. This is similar to the structure **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.7185613), which also has a diketopiperazine-like core with aromatic substitution.
   
2. **Aromatic Substitution**: The molecule has a **phenyl ring (c2ccccc2)** attached to one nitrogen and a **methyl group (C)** on the other nitrogen. This is somewhat analogous to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 1.62336425), which has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl group.

3. **Polarity and Conjugation**: The presence of the **carbonyl group (=O)** and the **aromatic system** suggests moderate polarity and extended conjugation, which typically increases the property value compared to purely aliphatic systems.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (0.7185613): This has a similar diketopiperazine core with an aromatic ring but lacks the additional nitrogen in the ring.
   - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (1.62336425): This has a more extended conjugated system with a fused aromatic ring and carbonyl, leading to a higher value.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (1.00509836): This has a similar core but with aliphatic substitutions, yielding a lower value than the aromatic-substituted analogs.

### Prediction:
Given that **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has:
- A **diketopiperazine-like core** (similar to the first example, property ~0.72),
- An **additional aromatic ring** (increasing the value, as seen in the second example, property ~1.62),
- But **less conjugation** than the fused system in the second example,

the property value is likely **between 0.72 and 1.62**, closer to the lower end due to the less extended conjugation. 

A reasonable estimate is **~1.1**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1.1** (approximate, based on structural analogs).

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular features. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - Example: `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has a property value of **2.33227745**, but this is a more complex ester with aromatic rings and multiple substituents.
     - Simpler esters like `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (a steroid ester) have a high value (**11.48645162**), but this is due to the large, complex structure.
     - The ester group alone doesn't consistently correlate with very high or low values in simpler cases.
   - **Aliphatic Chains**:
     - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCC` has **-0.68391981**, `CCCCCCCI` has **0.45870258**) tend to have moderately negative to slightly positive values unless other functional groups dominate.
   - **Combination of Aliphatic Chain and Ester**:
     - The molecule `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` is a simple aliphatic ester (ethyl hexanoate) with no aromaticity or highly polar substituents. Based on similar-sized aliphatic molecules with moderate polarity, we can expect a value in the low-to-moderate range.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(=O)OC` (methyl acetate, not in the list but analogous) would likely have a low value (similar to other small polar molecules like `COC=O` with **-0.95997561**).
   - `CCCCCC(=O)O` (hexanoic acid, not in the list) might have a slightly higher value due to the carboxylic acid, but the ester derivative (`CCCCCC(=O)OCC`) is less polar and would likely have a lower value than the acid.
   - `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` is larger than `COC=O` but less polar than many of the high-value examples (e.g., those with multiple halogens or complex rings).

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given the lack of aromaticity, halogens, or other strongly contributing groups, and considering the modest size and polarity of the ester, a reasonable estimate is **slightly negative to near zero**.
   - A comparable example is `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (not in the list, but similar to `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` with **0.37192072**), suggesting a value around **0.3 to 0.5** for the ester. However, `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` is slightly larger and less polar than some of the higher examples, so a value closer to **0.2 to 0.4** seems plausible.

**Final Predicted Property Value**: **0.35** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely in the low-positive range for this simple aliphatic ester.)

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5287867012389617
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key observations:
1. **Aromatic ester group**: The molecule contains a benzoate (aromatic ester) moiety, similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) with a value of **-0.32248511**  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) with a value of **-0.26772778**  
   - **COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1** (a more complex aromatic ester) with a value of **2.07428706**  

2. **Simpler aromatic esters** (like ethyl benzoate) tend to have values around **-0.3 to -0.7**, while more complex or substituted ones have higher values.

3. **Methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate (just replacing ethyl with methyl), so its value should be close but slightly different due to the smaller alkyl group.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyl benzoate: **-0.32248511**  
- Methyl substitution may slightly increase the value (less hydrophobic than ethyl), but the effect is small.  

A reasonable estimate for **methyl benzoate** would be:  
**≈ -0.30 to -0.35**  

### Final predicted value:  
**-0.33**  

*(This aligns with the trend of simple aromatic esters in the dataset.)*

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.8465023637757302
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as size, polarity, functional groups, and halogenation. The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple linear conjugated diene with no heteroatoms or halogens.

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene) has a property value of **-0.77137404**.
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a value of **-0.63471717**.
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **-0.3587734**.
- **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a value of **-0.66258771**.

Since **C=CCC=C** is a small, nonpolar hydrocarbon with conjugated double bonds (but no aromaticity or complex functional groups), its property value should be close to other small alkenes or alkanes. 

Given that **CC/C=C/C** (a similar alkene) is **-0.77137404**, and **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) is **-0.66258771**, I would predict **C=CCC=C** to have a slightly higher (less negative) value due to its conjugation, but still in the same range. 

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -0.70** (approximate, likely between -0.75 and -0.65 based on the examples). 

For specificity, I'll estimate:  
**-0.71** (similar to simple alkenes but slightly less negative due to conjugation). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.38493416470276226
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high value of **3.58127337**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (pentachlorobiphenyl derivative) has a value of **1.9526865**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a halogenated alkane) has a value of **-0.62495654**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated analog of these, similar to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but with more bromines.

2. **Size and Symmetry**:
   - Smaller, symmetric halogenated molecules (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Larger, heavily halogenated aromatic systems (e.g., hexachlorobenzene) have high positive values.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is small and symmetric but heavily brominated, which may increase the property value compared to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**.

3. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which might slightly increase the property value compared to chlorinated analogs.

### Prediction:
Given that **BrC(Br)Br** is a small, fully brominated molecule, its property value is likely higher than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (-0.62495654) but lower than the heavily chlorinated aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**. 

Looking at similar small halogenated alkanes:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**: -0.62495654 (mixed halogens, less symmetric)
- **BrC(Br)Br** is more symmetric and fully brominated, so we might expect a value closer to **0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is **0.75**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and trends. Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is a rough interpolation.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 28.02989825282543
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Key Structural Features of the Molecule:**
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 19.12365378). This group tends to increase the property value significantly when combined with aromatic systems and other functional groups.
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Contributes to the property value, especially when substituted (e.g., with carbonyl groups or halogens).
3. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: A cyclic amide (lactam) fused to an aromatic ring, similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 2.62127443). This suggests a moderate positive contribution.
4. **Chlorine substituent (CCl)**: Halogens like chlorine often increase the property value, especially when attached to aliphatic chains or aromatic systems.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as the phosphorothioate or aromatic systems.

---

### **Comparison with Similar Molecules:**
1. **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 19.12365378):  
   - This molecule has a phosphorothioate group, an aromatic ring, and a chlorine substituent, similar to our target molecule. However, it also has an additional amide group and a larger aromatic system, which likely contribute to its high value.
   - Our molecule lacks the extra amide but has a lactam and a smaller aromatic system, so the property should be lower but still significant.

2. **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 2.62127443):  
   - This molecule has a lactam and aromatic rings with chlorine substituents, similar to our target. However, it lacks the phosphorothioate group, which is a major contributor in our case.

3. **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 3.58127337):  
   - This molecule has multiple chlorine substituents on aromatic rings, contributing to its property value. Our molecule has fewer chlorines but compensates with the phosphorothioate group.

---

### **Prediction:**
Given the presence of:
- A **phosphorothioate group** (strong contributor, similar to the molecule with property = 19.12 but less substituted),
- A **lactam-aromatic system** (moderate contributor, similar to the molecule with property = 2.62),
- A **chlorine substituent** (small contributor),
- **Ethoxy groups** (minor contributor),

the property value should be **between 5 and 15**, leaning toward the higher end due to the phosphorothioate group. 

Comparing with the most similar molecule (**COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, property = 19.12), our molecule is less complex but still has significant features. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 12.5**

---

### **Final Answer:**
The predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is **12.5**.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 3.3887389155535046
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values are influenced by molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features. Here's a breakdown of the trends:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains or small polar molecules** (e.g., `CCOC=C`, `CC=C(C)C`) tend to have negative values around **-0.5 to -0.8**.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents** (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1`, `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2`) range from **-0.6 to +0.5**, with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) often increasing the value.
3. **Complex polycyclic or heterocyclic systems** (e.g., steroids, fused rings) have higher positive values (e.g., **4.5 to 14.9**), especially with multiple functional groups or halogens.
4. **Halogen-rich or sulfur/nitrogen-heavy systems** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`) show significantly higher values (**1.4 to 9.8**).

### Target Molecule:  
`CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C`  

#### Key Features:
- **Aromatic ring** with **chlorine substituent** (increases value, similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` → **0.478**).
- **Urea-like fragment** (`C(=O)N`) and **tertiary amide** (`CN(C)C=O`), which are polar (similar to `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` → **-0.418** but more complex).
- **Heterocycle** (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) with a **ketone**, akin to `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` → **0.524**.
- **Bulky tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`), which adds steric complexity (raises value).

#### Prediction:  
The combination of **aromatic chlorine**, **polar amides/heterocycles**, and **bulky substituents** suggests a **moderate positive value**. Comparable molecules (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` or `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2`) range **0.5–1.4**. Given the additional complexity, the predicted value is likely **higher than 1.0 but below 3.0**.

#### Final Estimate:  
**Predicted property value: 1.85**  
*(Rationale: Mid-range for halogenated polar heterocycles with bulky groups, interpolating between similar examples.)*

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1.1574191051924512
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is:

**Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a chlorinated diphenyl ether (specifically resembling a polychlorinated diphenyl ether, with three Cl substituents and two phenolic -OH groups). 

### Observations from the training data:
1. **Chlorinated aromatics**: 
   - Simple chlorinated benzenes (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`) have values around **-0.5 to 0.5**, with more Cl substituents tending to increase the value slightly (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has **0.48695481**).
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has **-0.49122827**, while `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has **-0.09994673**, suggesting that more Cl atoms increase the property value.

2. **Phenolic groups (-OH)**:
   - Phenols (e.g., `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1`) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.64477042**), but the presence of other substituents can modulate this.

3. **Ether linkages (-O-)**:
   - Ethers (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) contribute to negative values, but combined with Cl, the effect is less negative.

4. **Symmetry and size**:
   - Larger, symmetric molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., `OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O`) have very high positive values (**12.8625779**), but this is an extreme case. Smaller fused systems (e.g., `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2`) have modest positive values (**0.16085422**).

### Prediction for `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`:
- This molecule has:
  - Two phenolic -OH groups.
  - Three Cl substituents.
  - An ether linkage connecting two chlorinated phenyl rings.
  - Moderate size and symmetry.

Given the trends:
- The base value for a chlorinated phenol is around **-0.5**.
- Adding more Cl atoms tends to increase the value (e.g., from **-0.491** to **-0.099** for tri-Cl).
- The ether linkage and second chlorinated phenyl ring add complexity, likely pushing the value into slightly positive territory, similar to `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (**0.48695481**).

However, the presence of two -OH groups may offset this slightly. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. 

### Final predicted value:
**0.35** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of similar examples).

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.7713740394466363
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular weight, hydrophobicity, or some form of additive contribution from functional groups and structural features. 

Let's analyze the given molecule: **CC/C=C\C** (trans-2-pentene). 

This is a simple alkene with 5 carbons and one double bond. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CC/C=C/C** (another notation for trans-2-butene, 4 carbons) has a property value of **-0.77137404**.
- **CCCC(=O)OC** (ethyl acetate, 4 carbons + ester group) has a value of **-0.69289896**.
- **CCCC(C)C** (branched alkane, 6 carbons) has a value of **-0.59017702**.

The molecule **CC/C=C\C** (trans-2-pentene) is slightly larger than trans-2-butene but smaller than a 6-carbon branched alkane. The double bond may contribute slightly differently than a saturated bond, but the overall property seems to scale with size and simplicity.

Given the trend, a reasonable prediction for **CC/C=C\C** would be slightly higher than **-0.77137404** (trans-2-butene) but still in the negative range. 

**Predicted property value: -0.70** (approximate, based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like logP or molar refractivity, the value would need adjustment.)
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.6647198088890071
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Ethers**:
   - **C** (methane): -1.05408121
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -0.97140107
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.89349899
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.88345001
   - **CC(C)Cl** (isopropyl chloride): -0.81432409
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): -0.6653892
   - **CCCO** (1-propanol): Not explicitly given, but alcohols with short chains tend to have negative values.
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.34778745

2. **Ethers**:
   - No exact ether examples are provided, but **CCCOCC** is structurally similar to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol), except with an oxygen bridge instead of a hydroxyl group. Ethers are generally less polar than alcohols, so their property values might be slightly less negative (closer to zero) than the corresponding alcohols.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Ethers and alcohols with similar carbon skeletons tend to have negative property values, but ethers are less polar than alcohols, so their values are likely less negative. For example:
     - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.88345001
     - **CCCO** (1-propanol, hypothetical): Likely similar or slightly more negative than isopropanol.
     - **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether): Expected to be less negative than **CCCO** because the oxygen is less polar in an ether.

4. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer chains or branching tend to reduce the magnitude of the property value (closer to zero). For example:
     - **CC(C)O** (branched): -0.88345001
     - **CCC(O)CC** (longer chain): -0.6653892
   - **CCCOCC** is a symmetric ether with a moderate chain length, so its value should be between -0.6 and -0.8.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
Given the trends:
- The property value for **CCCOCC** should be less negative than **CC(C)O** (-0.883) but more negative than **CCC(O)CC** (-0.665). 
- Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so the value should be closer to zero than the corresponding alcohol. 
- A reasonable estimate is around **-0.7**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-0.70**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 2.215336450074997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide group**: `C(=O)N` (present in many examples with varying contributions).
   - **Tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)` (bulky hydrophobic group).
   - **Two aromatic rings**: `c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2` (common in many examples, often contributing to moderate property values).

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a property value of **3.37810644**. This molecule has an amide, aromatic rings, and a thiophene-linked group, which is somewhat analogous but more polar/heterocyclic than our target molecule.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** has a property value of **2.17708579**. This is a simpler amide with aliphatic rings, suggesting that amides with bulky/aliphatic groups tend to have values in the 2-3 range.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two aromatic rings linked by an aliphatic chain) has a property value of **0.47951178**, indicating that aromaticity alone without polar groups gives lower values.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the amide group (`C(=O)N`) typically increases the property value compared to purely hydrophobic structures (e.g., alkanes or simple aromatics).
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)`) adds hydrophobicity but also steric bulk, which may moderately increase the property value.
   - The **two aromatic rings** are neutral to slightly positive contributors unless substituted with polar groups.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule is most similar to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (3.378)** but lacks the heterocyclic/thiophene moiety, which likely reduces polarity. It is also somewhat similar to **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 (2.177)**, but with aromatic rings instead of aliphatic rings, which may increase the value slightly. 

Thus, a reasonable estimate would be between **2.5 and 3.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to the two aromatic rings and the amide group. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 3.1** (approximate, likely between 2.8 and 3.3 based on structural analogs). 

For specificity, I would predict **3.1** as a balanced estimate.
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.12958667787391662
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Br, Cl)** tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly positive (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1: -0.524`, `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.663`).
   - **Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH₂, OCH₃)** often have more negative values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C: -0.534`, `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1: -0.645`).
   - **Amide groups (e.g., CONH)** appear in molecules with moderately negative to near-zero values (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1: 0.098`).

2. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine on an aromatic ring tends to pull the property value toward zero (less negative) compared to hydrogen or alkyl groups (e.g., `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1: 0.244`, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.513`).

3. **Acetanilide-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent. Similar structures like `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2: 2.215` (more complex) and `OC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2: 0.541` suggest that the amide group combined with aromaticity can push the value toward positive or near-zero.

4. **Comparison with Closest Examples**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: Bromophenol, property = **-0.513**.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: Toluidine, property = **-0.634**.
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (hypothetical, not in list, but simpler acetanilide) would likely be slightly more negative than bromophenol due to the amide's electron-withdrawing effect.

### Prediction:
The presence of the **amide group (CONH)** and the **bromine substituent** will balance each other:
- The amide group is electron-withdrawing, which would typically make the property more negative.
- The bromine substituent is also electron-withdrawing but tends to pull the value toward zero (as seen in bromophenol: **-0.513**).

Given that the amide group is more polar than a simple hydroxyl or amino group, the property value will likely be slightly more negative than bromophenol but less negative than toluidine. 

**Estimated property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.45** (approximately midway between bromophenol and toluidine, adjusted for the amide's influence).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at `OC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2: 0.541` (a benzoyl-substituted phenol), the carbonyl group increases the value compared to simple phenol. However, in our case, the amide is less electron-withdrawing than a ketone, and the bromine counteracts. Thus, a value closer to zero than bromophenol is plausible.

**Final predicted property value: -0.35** (accounting for the amide's moderate electron-withdrawing effect and bromine's influence). 

However, revisiting the examples, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` is -0.513, and adding the amide (which is more polar than OH) would likely make the value slightly more positive (less negative). Thus, a better estimate might be **-0.40 to -0.30**. 

Given the data, **-0.38** is a reasonable compromise. 

But to be precise, let's average the closest analogs:
- Bromophenol: -0.513
- Toluidine: -0.634
- Simple acetanilide (no bromine, not in list, but likely ~-0.55)

With bromine + amide, the value should be between bromophenol and simple acetanilide. 

**Final answer: -0.45**. 

(Note: Without a direct example or a clear trend, this is an educated guess. The true value likely lies between -0.3 and -0.5.) 

After reconsidering, the amide's effect is stronger than bromine's, so shifting toward -0.4 is better. 

**Predicted property value: -0.42**. 

But to match the granularity of the given data, **-0.40** is a clean estimate. 

However, looking back at `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.513` and `Cc1ccc(N)cc1: -0.634`, the amide is closer to NH than OH in terms of electron donation, but the carbonyl withdraws. Thus, the value should be slightly more negative than bromophenol. 

**Final prediction: -0.50**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll stick with **-0.45** as the best balance. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-0.45**.

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.21249355451049493
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular structure and substituents.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple alkylbenzenes** (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**, toluene) have property values around **-0.6 to -0.2**:
   - Toluene (**Cc1ccccc1**): **-0.63248308**
   - Ethylbenzene (**CCc1ccc(C)cc1**): **-0.39217674**
   - Cumene (**CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**): **-0.23977292**

2. **Branching in the alkyl group** tends to slightly increase the property value (make it less negative):
   - Cumene (**CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**) has a higher value than toluene or ethylbenzene.

3. **Isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1)** has a branched isobutyl group, similar to cumene but with an extra methylene spacer. This might slightly reduce the property value compared to cumene but keep it higher than toluene.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Ethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(C)cc1)**: **-0.39217674**
- **Cumene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1)**: **-0.23977292**
- **Toluene (Cc1ccccc1)**: **-0.63248308**

Given that isobutylbenzene is between ethylbenzene and cumene in terms of branching and size, a reasonable estimate would be closer to cumene but slightly lower due to the longer chain.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.30** (approximate interpolation between cumene and ethylbenzene).

For higher precision, I would estimate:  
**-0.35** (accounting for the extra methylene group reducing the effect of branching slightly).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is approximately **-0.35**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.678806405855635
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Carbonyl (C=O) Groups**:
   - Molecules with aldehydes/ketones (e.g., **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1**, **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.15 to -0.66).
   - Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has a conjugated carbonyl (C=O) attached to a benzene ring, similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property: -0.583) and **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property: -0.520).

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**, property: -0.656) have negative values.
   - Benzaldehyde's aromatic ring is similar but lacks additional polar groups (like -OH or -NO2), so its value may be less negative than **COc1ccccc1**.

3. **Conjugation Effects**:
   - The conjugation of the carbonyl with the benzene ring in benzaldehyde may slightly increase the property value compared to non-conjugated carbonyls (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, property: 11.486), but this is an outlier due to its large steroid structure. For small conjugated systems, values remain negative.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property: -0.583) has an amide and phenol, making it more polar than benzaldehyde.
   - **COc1ccccc1** (property: -0.656) has an ether group, which is less electron-withdrawing than the aldehyde.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property: -0.520) has two nitro groups, which are strongly electron-withdrawing but still give a negative value.

### Prediction:
Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has a moderately electron-withdrawing aldehyde group conjugated to a benzene ring. Its property value should be slightly less negative than **COc1ccccc1** (-0.656) but more negative than **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.520). 

A reasonable estimate is **-0.60**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.60**
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.10626717112727488
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two amide groups (`N-C=O`), one of which is part of a cyclic urea-like structure (imidazolidine-2,4-dione core).
   - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to an aromatic ring.
   - An aromatic ether (`O` linking the aromatic ring to the rest of the molecule).
   - A conjugated system with alternating single and double bonds (aromatic ring and `N=C` linkage).

2. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, increasing polarity.
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - The aromatic ring with the nitro group and ether oxygen adds to the molecule's polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 1.0396).
   - Molecules with multiple polar/electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) have even higher values (~2.215).
   - The presence of the cyclic urea/amide core (similar to hydantoin) may further increase the value due to rigidity and polarity.

4. **Estimated Property Value**:
   - The molecule is more polar and complex than `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (1.0396) but less bulky than `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (2.215).
   - The cyclic amide core and nitro group suggest a value between **1.5 and 2.0**.
   - A reasonable estimate is **~1.75**, considering the balance of polarity and size.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.75** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend that more polar/electron-withdrawing groups correlate with higher values in the given data.)

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.17433457551208284
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., phenyl groups) tend to have property values in the range of -0.5 to 2.0, depending on substituents and functional groups.
   - Example: `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has a value of **-0.73408532**, while `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (azobenzene-like) has **0.1134287**.

2. **Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Systems**:
   - The presence of nitrogen in aromatic systems (e.g., amines, azo groups) influences the property value. 
   - For example:
     - `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline): **-0.73408532**
     - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (azo compound): **0.1134287**
     - `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (carbazole-like): **1.88298841**

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrical substitution (e.g., two phenyl rings) tends to increase the property value slightly compared to single-ring systems.
   - Example: `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3` (triphenyl-like) has **1.52291001**.

4. **Hydrazine-Like Linkage (N-N)**:
   - The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a hydrazine-like linkage (N-N) connecting two phenyl rings. This is similar to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (azo compound), but without the double bond. 
   - The absence of the double bond (weaker conjugation) may slightly lower the property value compared to the azo compound.

### Prediction:
The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = **0.1134287**), but with a single N-N bond instead of N=N. This reduced conjugation and electron delocalization would likely result in a slightly lower property value. 

Given the trends, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.05**

(Note: This is an approximate estimate based on the given examples and structural analogies. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.029633291031003983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring). This is reminiscent of a cyclic imide (e.g., succinimide or glutarimide derivatives).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity, which often correlates with higher property values in the given examples (e.g., molecules with multiple polar groups like nitro or amides tend to have values > 0).
3. **Ring Strain/Size**: The 5-membered ring (cyclopentane) fused to a 6-membered ring (cyclic imide) is not highly strained, but the rigidity and polarity of the imide contribute to the property.
4. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic urea/amide, property = 0.09795641): This has a similar cyclic diamide structure but with less rigidity and no fused ring. The property is low (~0.1).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (cyclic imide with alkyl substituents, property = 1.00509836): This is structurally closer, with a cyclic imide and alkyl groups, yielding a higher value (~1.0).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (succinimide core, not in examples but hypothetical): Such structures are more polar and rigid, likely pushing the value higher than simple cyclic amides.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has a **fused bicyclic imide structure** with two amide groups, similar to the second comparable example but with a slightly more rigid and polar framework (due to the fused cyclopentane). This would likely place its property value **between 1.0 and 2.0**. 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximately midway between the cyclic urea/amide and the more complex imide examples). 

However, looking more closely at **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 1.005), our molecule is even more rigid and symmetric, which might increase the value slightly. Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**Final predicted property value: 1.10**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is something like "molar refractivity" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would differ.) 

---
**Answer:** The predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is **1.10**.

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.8768735653061888
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy halogen substitution**: The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other). 
2. **Aromaticity**: It consists of two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl scaffold).
3. **Molecular weight and hydrophobicity**: The presence of multiple chlorines and aromatic rings suggests high hydrophobicity and significant molecular weight.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = **3.35587852**): This is a triphenylmethane derivative with **five chlorines**. Despite having more chlorines, the biphenyl core in our target molecule is similarly hydrophobic and bulky.
- **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (property = **-0.53370256**): A simple dichlorobenzene with much lower property value due to smaller size and fewer chlorines.
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (property = **2.44004407**): This has a complex heterocyclic scaffold with nitro groups, but our target lacks polar groups, relying solely on chlorines and aromaticity.

### Key Observations:
- The property tends to **increase with more chlorines and larger aromatic systems**.
- The biphenyl scaffold with three chlorines is less substituted than the triphenylmethane example (3.355) but more than dichlorobenzene (-0.533). 
- The lack of polar groups (like NO₂ or CO) suggests the value will be **lower than the triphenylmethane example** but **higher than simpler chlorinated aromatics**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between size, chlorine count, and lack of polar groups, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 2.85**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- 3+ chlorines + bulky aromatic systems → ~3.0–3.5  
- 2 chlorines + small aromatics → ~(-0.5)–0.5  
- Our molecule (3 chlorines + biphenyl) fits between these ranges.  

Thus, **2.85** is a plausible interpolation.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.16010527589926707
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, branching, and presence of heteroatoms or polar groups. 

The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, 1,4-diethylbenzene, based on the symmetry). This is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups attached to a benzene ring. 

From the examples:
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons with small alkyl groups (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N**, toluene-like structures) tend to have property values around **-0.6 to -0.3**.
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a value of **0.438**, which is higher due to the longer alkyl chain.
- **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has a value of **-0.572**, which is slightly more negative due to the nitrogen heteroatom.

Since **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is a purely hydrocarbon structure with two ethyl groups (no heteroatoms or polar groups), its property value should be slightly higher than toluene-like structures but lower than hexylbenzene. 

Given the symmetry and lack of polar features, a reasonable estimate would be close to **0.0**, but likely slightly negative due to the simplicity of the structure. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.1 to 0.3**. 

A precise guess based on the trend would be:  
**0.25**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.09096643961300943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a **para-substituted benzene ring** with:
   - An **amino group (-NH₂)** at position 1.
   - A **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** at position 4.

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - The **amino group (-NH₂)** is electron-donating and polar.
   - The **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** is highly polar and electron-withdrawing due to the sulfonyl (=O) groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Similar to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = **-0.61009002**), which has an amino group and a nitro group (also electron-withdrawing). The sulfonamide here is even more polar than the nitro group, likely increasing the property value slightly.
   - Another comparable molecule is **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (property = **-0.37755898**), which has two nitro groups (strong electron-withdrawing effects) but lacks the amino group. The sulfonamide in our molecule is less electron-withdrawing than two nitro groups but more than one.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The sulfonamide group adds significant polarity but is less bulky than some of the large polycyclic or halogenated structures in the dataset (which have higher values).
   - The molecule is smaller than most high-value examples (e.g., steroids or large polyaromatics).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the electron-donating amino group and the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide, along with moderate polarity and size, the property value should be **slightly higher than -0.61009002** (the nitro analog) but still negative due to the polar but not excessively bulky nature.

**Predicted value: -0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend of similar molecules in the dataset.)*  

### Rationale:
- The sulfonamide is more polar than a single nitro group but less destabilizing than two nitro groups (as in **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**, which has a value of -0.377).  
- The amino group slightly offsets the electron-withdrawing effect, keeping the value in the moderately negative range.  

Thus, **-0.45** is a reasonable interpolation from the given examples.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.9216365472531778
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (specifically, it is **triphenylene**). The SMILES notation breaks down as follows:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**: This describes a central benzene ring (c1ccc...) fused to two other benzene rings (c2... and c3...), with a fourth ring (c4...) completing the triphenylene structure.

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple benzene (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) or monocyclic aromatics with small substituents (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.656, -0.511).
   - Larger fused aromatic systems (e.g., **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**) have higher positive values (e.g., 2.176, 2.694).
   - The property seems to increase with the number of fused rings and conjugation.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2) often increase the property slightly compared to unsubstituted analogs (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** has 0.871 vs. simpler aromatics with lower values).
   - Extended conjugation or additional fused rings significantly boost the property (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** has 2.694).

3. **Triphenylene-like Systems**:
   - The given molecule is structurally similar to **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property = 2.694), but with one fewer outer benzene ring. This suggests a slightly lower value.

### Prediction:
The molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** (triphenylene) has:
- **4 fused benzene rings** (like the example with 2.694, but less extended).
- **No substituents** (simpler than halogenated examples).
- **High conjugation** but not as extensive as the largest examples.

Given these factors, the property value should be **between 1.5 and 2.5**, closer to the lower end due to the smaller size compared to the 2.694 example. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.1** (specific: 2.10000000)  

This aligns with the trend where larger, more conjugated fused aromatics have higher values, and triphenylene fits this category but is not as extreme as the largest examples.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.629119099735804
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and aromatic rings. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This molecule has the following features:
1. Multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups (high polarity).
2. A carbonyl group (C=O).
3. Fused aromatic rings (increased molecular complexity).
4. Ether linkage (Oc).

Comparing this to similar molecules in the dataset:
- Molecules with multiple -OH groups and aromatic rings (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`) have values around **3.4**.
- Molecules with fused aromatic systems and polar groups (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`) have values around **2.68**.
- The presence of the carbonyl group and additional -OH groups likely increases the property value further.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for this molecule is likely in the range of **3.5 to 4.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 3.75**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities to the provided examples. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the exact nature of the property being predicted.)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 1.3565910052681898
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)** tend to increase the property value significantly. For example:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **4.01979966**.
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **4.24204884**.
   - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has an exceptionally high value of **32.66799891**.

2. **Chlorine atoms** also contribute to higher values, especially when multiple are present (e.g., `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` has **9.59383399**).

3. **Simple alkanes or non-polar groups** (e.g., `CCCCC`) have negative values (e.g., **-0.68391981**).

4. **Polar or functionalized groups (e.g., esters, nitro groups, amides)** can moderately increase or decrease the value depending on the context.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A **phosphoryl group (P=O)** with an amide linkage (`NC(C)=O`).
- A **thioether (S-C)** group.
- No chlorine atoms or aromatic systems.

Given the presence of the **P=O** group (similar to the high-value examples) but lacking multiple chlorines or extended conjugation, we can expect a moderately high value, though not as extreme as the highest examples.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (4.242) has P=O and multiple chlorines.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (4.019) has P=S and multiple chlorines.
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (32.668) is an outlier due to its large size and multiple functional groups.

Since **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has P=O but no chlorines or large hydrophobic groups, its value should be **lower than 4.242 but still positive**.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is:  
**3.5** (approximate, likely between 3.0 and 4.0).

### Refined Estimate:
Given that:
- The amide (`NC(C)=O`) and thioether (`SC`) groups are less impactful than chlorines but still polar, and  
- The molecule is smaller than the high-value examples,  

A more precise prediction is:  
**3.8** (closer to the lower end of the phosphorus-containing examples).  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC: 3.8** (approximate range: 3.5–4.0).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)*

True Property: -0.844803188463413
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electronegativity or polarity. The molecule in question is **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene, likely the *trans* isomer due to the notation).

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple alkanes/alkenes with halogens**: 
   - `CCBr` has a value of **-0.75668374** (simple alkyl bromide).
   - `CCCCBr` has a value of **-0.49112975** (longer chain reduces the negative impact).
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high value of **2.67890972** due to multiple chlorines and aromaticity.
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **-0.61606596** (chloroaniline).

2. **Chlorinated alkenes/aromatics**:
   - Chlorine substituents tend to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but not as dramatically as other functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, phosphates).
   - `Cl\C=C/Cl` is a simple dihaloalkene with no additional functional groups or complexity.

3. **Trend for small halogenated molecules**:
   - Small molecules with halogens (e.g., `CCBr`, `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`) have negative or slightly negative values.
   - `Cl\C=C/Cl` is slightly more polar than `CCBr` but less complex than chlorinated aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given its simplicity and two chlorines (but no aromaticity or other functional groups), the property value for `Cl\C=C/Cl` is likely in the **slightly negative range**, similar to other small halogenated molecules. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (between `CCBr` (-0.756) and `CCCCBr` (-0.491), accounting for the double bond's slight polarity increase).

### Final answer:
**-0.45** (approximate predicted value).

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.8066148961920347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Rings:**
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly listed, but similar simple aromatic systems with substitutions have property values around **-0.6 to 0.6**.
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) has a value of **-0.62049826**.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1** (more complex aromatic with substitutions) has higher values (~1.6-1.8).

2. **Heterocyclic Aromatic Rings:**
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a complex heterocycle) has a value of **-0.39401562**.
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (another heterocycle) has a value of **-0.43563655**.
   - These suggest that nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to have slightly negative values unless heavily substituted with polar or bulky groups.

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1):**
   - Pyridine is a simple 6-membered heterocycle with one nitrogen. It is less polar than aniline derivatives but more polar than benzene.
   - Comparing to similar-sized heterocycles (e.g., **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** and **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**), pyridine is simpler and likely has a value in the same range but slightly higher due to its smaller size and lower complexity.

4. **Substitution Effects:**
   - Unsubstituted aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**) with extended conjugation have higher values (~2.69), but pyridine lacks this.
   - Simple substitutions (e.g., **Cl**, **CH3**) tend to lower the value unless they introduce significant polarity or conjugation.

### Prediction:
Pyridine is a simple nitrogen-containing heterocycle with no additional substitutions or extended conjugation. Based on the examples:
- Similar heterocycles have values around **-0.4 to -0.6**.
- Pyridine is slightly more polar than benzene but less polar than aniline derivatives, so its value should be slightly higher than **-0.6** but lower than **-0.4**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is **-0.55**. 

This estimate balances the trends observed for simple heterocycles and unsubstituted aromatic systems in the given data.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 5.716255475955835
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is:

**OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Polar functional groups**: Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO`), an ester (`COC(=O)`), an aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3`), and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc23`).
2. **Extended conjugation**: The molecule has a large conjugated system due to the linked aromatic rings (`c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3...`).
3. **Hydrogen bonding potential**: The hydroxyl groups and the amine group can participate in hydrogen bonding.
4. **Chlorine substituent**: Adds some lipophilicity but also polarizability.

### Comparison with similar molecules in the dataset:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have property values around **-0.3 to -0.5**.
- Molecules with conjugated aromatic systems and polar substituents (e.g., `c1ccc2cnccc2c1`, `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3`) have values around **-0.4 to 0.2**.
- Molecules with ester groups and aromatic systems (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC`) have values around **0.5**.
- The presence of the chloro-substituted aromatic ring and the amine linker (`Nc2ccnc3`) adds complexity, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` with **2.69**).

### Prediction:
This molecule is more complex than most in the dataset, with significant conjugation, polar groups, and hydrogen bonding. It likely has a **higher property value** than simple polar/aliphatic molecules but not as extreme as the largest polycyclic systems (e.g., **6.14**). 

Given the ester, aromatic amine, and chloro-substituted aromatic system, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.25**  

This balances the contributions from polarity, conjugation, and structural complexity.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.6566507256989402
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.3587734  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): -0.07566375  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 0.45870258  
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (decalin): 0.43449229  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): -0.70001829  
   - **CSSC** (dimethyl disulfide): -0.15693986  

   Hydrocarbons with no polar groups tend to have negative or low-positive values. Longer chains or branching may slightly increase the value.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups:**
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): -0.87465221  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): -0.95997561  
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)...** (complex ester): 16.48643029  
   - **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (steroid-like with two -OH): 5.06853283  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol): -0.09702675  

   The presence of **-OH** or **-O-** groups can increase the property value, especially if there are multiple polar groups or conjugation. Simple alcohols (e.g., cyclooctanol) have values closer to zero or slightly negative.

3. **Polarity and Size:**
   - Larger molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., steroids, complex esters) have higher values.  
   - Small alcohols (e.g., **CCO**, ethanol not in the list but analogous) would likely have values near zero or slightly negative.  

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- It is a medium-length alcohol (5-carbon chain with one -OH group).  
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol, -0.09702675), which is a larger cyclic alcohol, **CCCCCO** is linear and smaller.  
- The linear chain may slightly decrease the value compared to cyclic analogs.  
- No other polar groups or conjugation are present.  

Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCO** is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than small esters or hydrocarbons.  

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: -0.15**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend of alcohols and similar-sized molecules in the dataset.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the trend holds for typical physicochemical properties.)*

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 2.8813381820948285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2**: -0.04919185 (contains a benzene ring and heteroatoms).
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2**: 0.11430096 (contains two benzene rings with amino groups).
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**: -0.71841561 (benzene ring with hydroxyl groups).

   The benzene ring here is substituted with an amide group (C(=O)N), which may increase the property value slightly compared to plain benzene.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is a polar functional group that can influence the property. Examples with amides:
   - **CCC(Br)(CC)C(=O)NC(N)=O**: 0.1615902.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC**: -0.01624844.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: -0.45155113.

   The amide here is part of a larger conjugated system, which may increase the property value.

3. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a highly polar and electron-withdrawing group. Examples with sulfonyl or similar groups:
   - **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**: 12.45184128 (contains P=O and P=S, which are somewhat analogous to S=O in terms of polarity).
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 4.55606066 (contains P=S and nitro group).

   The sulfonyl group is likely to significantly increase the property value.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (CCO1)**: The molecule contains a 5-membered ring with oxygen and sulfur. Examples with heterocycles:
   - **Cc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O**: -0.66622286 (a heterocycle with carbonyl groups).
   - **c1ccncc1**: -0.8066149 (a simple heterocycle).

   The heterocycle here is more complex and conjugated, which may increase the property value.

5. **Overall Polarity and Conjugation**: The molecule has significant polarity (amide + sulfonyl) and conjugation (benzene + heterocycle), which suggests a higher property value than simple hydrocarbons but lower than highly polar or large conjugated systems like **OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7** (49.96945895).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is somewhat similar to **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** (12.45184128) but lacks the phosphate group and has a simpler structure. Thus, the property value should be lower.
- It is also somewhat similar to **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (16.18507898), but again, less complex.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above analysis, the molecule's property value is likely in the range of **3.0 to 6.0**. A reasonable estimate is **4.5**, considering the sulfonyl group's strong influence and the aromatic/amide contributions.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1: 4.5** (approximate, likely between 4.0 and 5.0).

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 3.497295012294063
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group**: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is present in some of the examples (e.g., **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** with a value of **-0.549251**). Nitro groups tend to increase the property value slightly when combined with other features.
2. **Ester groups (COO)**: There are two ester groups (**C(=O)OC**), which are polar and can contribute to higher property values. For example, **CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC** (with two ester groups and a long alkyl chain) has a very high value of **21.52949577**, but this molecule is much smaller.
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen**: The molecule includes a nitrogen in a non-aromatic ring (likely a pyrrole-like structure), which can contribute to polarity. Compare to **c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2** (indole-like) with a value of **-0.52541979**, but this is less relevant due to the additional features here.
4. **Substituted aromatic system**: The benzene ring is part of a larger conjugated system with multiple functional groups, increasing complexity and likely the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest examples are molecules with nitro groups, ester groups, and aromatic systems:
  - **CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups and CF3) has a value of **2.60064465**.
  - **CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23** (complex heterocycle with amide) has a value of **3.7184643**.
  - **CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O** (sulfonamide and aromatic) has a value of **8.83087831**.

Given the presence of two ester groups, a nitro group, and a conjugated aromatic system, the property value is likely higher than simple nitro-aromatics but not as extreme as very large or heavily halogenated molecules. 

### Predicted Value:
Considering the contributions from the nitro group, esters, and conjugated system, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 4.2**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities to the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.4148325549523525
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure with a fused cyclopropane.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant polarity, but the cyclopropane ring adds some rigidity and reduces flexibility.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is small (6 heavy atoms) but has a constrained, rigid structure due to the cyclopropane and imide ring.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Small polar molecules** (e.g., **Clc1cccc(I)c1**, **CCCCCCCO**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.2 to -0.8).
- **Cyclic structures with polar groups** (e.g., **c1ccncc1** with -0.806, **C1CCCCC1** with -0.521) also have negative values.
- **Molecules with multiple amides/imide groups** (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** with -0.028) are less negative but still modest.
- The **rigidity** of the cyclopropane and imide ring may slightly increase the property value compared to flexible chains.

### Prediction:
Given the small size, high polarity (two amides), and rigidity, the property value is likely **moderately negative**. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.6**. 

Looking at similar cyclic/polar examples:
- **c1ccncc1** (pyridine, rigid and polar): -0.806
- **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane, nonpolar): -0.521
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (polar but larger): -0.028

This molecule is more polar than cyclohexane but less polar than pyridine due to the imide's balance of polarity and rigidity. A good intermediate value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.55** (close to cyclohexane but adjusted for higher polarity). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.55**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.8677557435727549
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.68391981  
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.74502017  
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.66822473  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): -0.16669204  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.1651291  
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.97930845  

   These molecules are relatively simple (alkanes, alkenes, or halogenated hydrocarbons) and have negative property values, typically in the range of -0.2 to -0.9. The presence of halogens (Cl) does not drastically increase the property value unless the molecule is highly substituted (e.g., hexachlorobenzene is less negative than chlorobenzene).

2. **Chloroethane (ClCC)**:
   - This is a very simple halogenated alkane (ethyl chloride), structurally similar to chloromethane (not in the examples but can be inferred).  
   - It has only one chlorine atom and a short carbon chain (C2), so it is expected to have a property value in the negative range, similar to other simple halogenated alkanes or alkanes.  
   - Comparing to **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene, -0.668) and **CCCCC** (pentane, -0.684), **ClCC** is simpler than chlorobenzene but has a halogen, so its value should be slightly more negative than pentane but less negative than **CC#N** (-0.979).  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **ClCC** would be around **-0.75**. This aligns with the values for similarly simple halogenated or non-halogenated small molecules in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (approximate predicted property value for ClCC).
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.029141842457314503
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl)** group and a **chlorine (Cl)** atom. 
   - Pyridine is aromatic but more polarizable than benzene due to the nitrogen heteroatom.
   - The trichloromethyl group is highly electronegative and bulky, contributing to steric and electronic effects.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Chlorine atoms on the ring and the trichloromethyl group increase molecular weight and polarizability.
   - The trichloromethyl group is similar to examples like **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)... (3.93583865)** and **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (3.35587852)**, where multiple chlorines + bulky groups lead to higher property values.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (0.87687357)**: Two chlorinated phenyl rings, but no trichloromethyl group. Property is moderate.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (3.35587852)**: Trichloromethyl group + chlorinated rings, similar to our molecule but with an extra phenyl ring. Property is ~3.35.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)... (3.93583865)**: Trichloromethyl + complex structure, property ~3.93.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A pyridine ring (slightly more polarizable than benzene).
- A trichloromethyl group (strongly contributing to the property).
- Additional chlorine substituents.

The property value should be **higher than 0.87687357 (dichlorinated biphenyl)** but **lower than 3.93583865 (trichloromethyl + complex group)**. A reasonable estimate is **~2.5**, but looking at the closer analog **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (3.35587852)**, which has a trichloromethyl group + chlorinated rings, our molecule is slightly less bulky (no second phenyl ring), so the value should be slightly lower.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 2.85** (interpolated between similar structures). 

However, since the examples with trichloromethyl groups are ~3.35-3.93, and our molecule is simpler, a more conservative estimate is **~3.0**. 

Given the data, the closest match suggests **~3.0 to 3.4**. I'll refine to **3.2** as a balanced prediction. 

**Answer: 3.2** (approximate interpolation based on structural analogs). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The actual value may vary slightly.)
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.5368743306984924
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (hexan-3-ol): Property value = **-0.35205512**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.51070107**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.54712387**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-hexanol): Property value = **-0.53556245**

   Alcohols generally have negative property values in the range of **-0.35 to -0.55**, with slight variations depending on branching or aromaticity.

2. **Branching**:
   - Branching tends to slightly lower the property value (more negative) compared to linear alcohols. For example:
     - **CCC(C)CCO** (-0.547) vs. **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.352).
   - However, this trend is not absolute, as **CCC(CC)CO** (-0.535) is closer to the branched example.

3. **Position of -OH**:
   - The position of the -OH group (primary vs. secondary) does not show a clear trend in the given examples, but secondary alcohols (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) seem slightly less negative than primary alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO**).

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O**:
- This is a **secondary alcohol** (2-hexanol), structurally similar to **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-hexanol) but with the -OH group at the 2-position instead of the 3-position.
- The property value for **CCCC(O)CCC** is **-0.35205512**, while **CCC(CC)CO** (another hexanol isomer) is **-0.53556245**.
- Given that branching slightly lowers the value, and 2-hexanol is branched at the 2-position, I would expect its value to be slightly more negative than **CCCC(O)CCC** but less negative than **CCC(C)CCO** (a primary alcohol).

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate for **CCCCC(C)O** is **-0.45**, interpolating between the given examples. 

However, looking more closely:
- The closest analog is **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.352), but with slight branching at the 2-position, the value might decrease slightly (e.g., by ~0.1).
- Thus, a more precise prediction would be **-0.45 ± 0.05**.

### Exact Value:
Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.45** (approximate, based on interpolation).  

If forced to pick a specific value from the trend, I would suggest:  
**-0.40** (closer to **CCCC(O)CCC** due to secondary alcohol similarity).  

But to match the precision of the given data, I'll round to:  
**-0.42000000** (a compromise between the two closest examples).  

However, reviewing again, **CCC(CC)CO** (3-hexanol) is **-0.53556245**, and **CCCC(O)CCC** is **-0.35205512**, so 2-hexanol might fall in between.  

Final answer:  
**-0.44380879** (an interpolated average).  

But for simplicity, given the task, I'll provide a clean estimate:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O: -0.42**

   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property = -0.49317217
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene, same as above): Property = 0.48255056

   These show that symmetric dihalogenated benzenes (like 1,4-dichlorobenzene) have property values around **0.48 to 0.49**. The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., -OH in 2,5-dichlorophenol) can lower the value.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs.
   - Example with Br: **CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O** has a property = 1.51548151, but this is a complex structure with other functional groups.

3. **Simple Halogenated Benzenes**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): Not directly given, but similar to dichlorobenzene, we can infer it would be slightly lower than 0.48 (likely ~0.3-0.4).
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is structurally analogous to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, but with bromine instead of chlorine.

### Prediction:
Since bromine is more polarizable than chlorine, the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is expected to be **slightly higher** than that of **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.48255056). 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:
**Predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: ~0.55 to 0.60**

For specificity, we can approximate it to **0.55**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.55**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 2.6689922164243396
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine substitution), and aromaticity. The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated biphenyl derivative with the structure:

**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a hexachlorinated biphenyl (similar to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), where each benzene ring has three chlorine substituents. 

From the training data:
- The molecule **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a decachlorinated biphenyl) has a property value of **7.7046527**.
- The molecule **ClC(Br)Br** (a simple trihalomethane) has a value of **-0.545535**.

The given molecule has fewer chlorines (6) than the decachlorinated biphenyl (10), so its value should be lower but still significantly positive due to the aromaticity and halogenation. 

Comparing to other examples:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **2.68392561**.
- **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a complex aromatic system) has a value of **2.84551299**.

Given the high halogenation and biphenyl structure, the value should be higher than these but less than the decachlorinated biphenyl. 

### Predicted property value: **5.2** (estimated range: 4.5–6.0, likely closer to 5.2 based on interpolation). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The value likely represents something like logP, molar refractivity, or a similar descriptor that increases with halogenation and aromaticity.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 11.583551161010782
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl groups and one central phenyl group).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(...)...)**: Highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: Hydrophobic but not as influential as the polar phosphate group.
4. **Ether linkages (Oc2... and Oc3...)**: Moderate polarity contributors.

### Comparison to training examples:
- Molecules with phosphate groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`, property = 28.02989825) have very high property values due to their polarity and complexity.
- The given molecule has a phosphate group but lacks extreme electronegative substituents (like Cl or S) seen in the highest-value examples.
- It resembles moderately polar aromatic compounds with phosphate/ether groups, such as `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (property = 3.5359728), but with slightly less polarity due to fewer halogens.

### Predicted property:
Given the balance of aromaticity, moderate polarity from the phosphate/ether groups, and lack of extreme polarizing substituents, the predicted property value is:

**5.8** (estimated range: 5.5–6.5 based on similar examples). 

This places it between the phosphate-containing examples (higher values) and simpler aromatic/polar molecules (lower values).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 1.9762928530019404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and lipophilic group. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with CF3) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 4.156). This suggests CF3 contributes to increasing the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Aromatic systems with polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl) often have property values in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 unless combined with other bulky/highly polar groups.
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a chlorinated pyrrolidinone-like structure. Chlorine atoms and carbonyl groups (C=O) increase polarity and lipophilicity. Examples with multiple Cl atoms (e.g., `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl`) have very high values (6.002), but this molecule has only two Cl atoms.
4. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (CF3 + Cl + complex heterocycle) = 4.156.
   - `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (multiple Cl + aromatic) = 2.728.
   - `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (Cl + aromatic + OMe) = 3.536.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A CF3 group (strongly increasing effect),
- Two Cl atoms (moderate increasing effect),
- A polar heterocycle with C=O (increasing effect),
- An aromatic system (neutral to slight increase),

the molecule is likely to have a **property value between 3.0 and 4.0**. A reasonable estimate, considering the CF3 and Cl contributions, is **~3.7**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 3.7** (estimated range: 3.5–4.0). 

This aligns with the trend that highly halogenated (F, Cl) and polar groups increase the property value significantly.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.512737361889908
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**: 
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **-0.74840423**.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (toluene derivative) has a value of **-0.57546362**.
   - Aromatic rings with small substituents (e.g., -OH, -CH3) tend to have negative values close to -0.5 to -0.7.

2. **Nitro Group (-NO2) Impact**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.52204059**.
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing but does not drastically increase the property value in this context (remains negative).

3. **Methoxy Group (-OCH3) Impact**:
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** contains both a methoxy (-OCH3) and a nitro (-NO2) group.
   - Methoxy is electron-donating, while nitro is electron-withdrawing. The combination may balance out somewhat.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (dimethyl phthalate) has a value of **-0.15187027**.
   - This suggests that ester groups on an aromatic ring give less negative values than simple substituents like -OH or -CH3.

### Prediction for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O:
- The molecule is **nitroanisole** (methoxy-nitrobenzene).
- The nitro group is more influential than the methoxy group in determining the property value.
- Compared to dinitrobenzene (-0.522) and phenol (-0.748), this molecule likely falls between these values but closer to dinitrobenzene due to the nitro group's dominance.
- The methoxy group slightly offsets the nitro group's effect, but not enough to make the value more negative than dinitrobenzene.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **-0.45 to -0.55**. Given the examples, I would assign:  
**-0.50** (approximately midway between dinitrobenzene and toluene derivatives).  

However, looking more precisely at the trend, **nitrobenzene-like structures** hover around **-0.5 to -0.6**, so:  

**Final Predicted Value: -0.55**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the given data; the true value could vary slightly depending on the exact property being modeled.)*

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.55**.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 5.8074673443231575
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of halogens (especially chlorine and bromine), nitro groups, and other functional groups. The property tends to increase (become more positive) with:

1. **Increased halogenation (especially Cl/Br)**: Molecules with multiple halogens (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` with 6 Cl atoms has a value of 1.28197037) tend to have higher property values.
2. **Structural complexity/rigidity**: Polycyclic or sterically constrained structures (e.g., steroids or fused rings) often have higher values.
3. **Presence of nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or sulfonyl groups (`S(=O)(=O)`)** tends to increase the value.

The molecule in question is:  
`ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`

### Analysis:
1. **High halogenation**: This molecule has **8 chlorine atoms**, which is more than any example provided (the highest in the examples was 6 Cl atoms, with a value of 1.28197037).
2. **Polycyclic structure**: It is a highly constrained, polycyclic (likely cage-like) structure, which adds to the complexity.
3. **No nitro/sulfonyl groups**: The absence of these groups may limit the value somewhat, but the extreme halogenation and rigidity dominate.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest example is `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (6 Cl atoms, value = 1.28197037).  
- Another relevant example is `Clc1ccccc1` (1 Cl atom, value = -0.66822473) and `ClCCCl` (2 Cl atoms, value = -0.75503001), showing that each additional Cl tends to increase the value.  
- The steroid-like structure `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (no Cl but high complexity) has a value of 13.36802474, indicating that complex rigid frameworks can greatly increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the **8 Cl atoms** and **highly constrained polycyclic structure**, the property value should be significantly higher than the 6-Cl example (1.28197037) but likely less than the steroid example (13.36802474) due to the absence of carbonyl groups or other polar features.  

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **3.0 to 5.0**. Considering the trend, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 4.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7834295482928028
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.34778745  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.89349899  
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.97930845  
   Simple hydrocarbons or small polar molecules tend to have negative property values, with more polar or unsaturated groups (e.g., triple bonds, nitriles) giving more negative values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (ethylbenzene with -OH): -0.51070107  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with amine): -0.2400619  
   Oxygenated groups (alcohols, esters) tend to reduce the negativity of the property compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the values remain negative unless other factors (e.g., aromaticity, halogens, complex rings) are involved.

3. **Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.2400619 (ethyl ester with aniline)  
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 2.97785003 (more complex ester with ether and aromatic rings)  
   Simple esters (like **CCCOC=O**) likely have negative or slightly positive values, depending on the rest of the structure. Since **CCCOC=O** is a small ester without additional functional groups or complexity, it should be closer to the simpler examples.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Small polar molecules (e.g., **CC#N**, **NC(=O)N**) have very negative values.  
   - Larger or more complex molecules (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 4.55606066) have positive values.  
   **CCCOC=O** is small and polar but not as polar as nitriles or amides, so its value should be less negative than those.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
- It is a small ester with no additional functional groups or complexity.  
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.2400619), **CCCOC=O** is simpler (no aromatic ring or amine), so its value should be slightly more negative.  
- Compared to **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (-0.51070107), the ester group is less polar than an alcohol directly attached to an aromatic ring, but the lack of an aromatic ring in **CCCOC=O** might balance this out.  

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This is based on its similarity to small polar molecules with negative values but not as extreme as nitriles or highly unsaturated systems.

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 1.32168092909583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with 6 carbons in the chain, property = 0.438) tend to have higher property values than shorter chains (e.g., **CC**, property = -0.944). 
   - The presence of aromatic rings or polar groups can modulate this effect.

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (**C(=O)OR**) and other polar groups (e.g., **OH**, **Cl**, **Br**) can either increase or decrease the property depending on their context. For example:
     - **COCC(=O)N(...)** (ester + amide) has a property of 1.824.
     - **CCOc1ccccc1** (ether) has a property of -0.486.
   - Carboxylic acids (**C(=O)OH**) or their derivatives (like esters) often increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Branching vs. Linear Chains**:
   - Linear chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**) tend to have higher property values than branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)I**, property = -0.631).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**
- This is a **linear 10-carbon chain (decanoate)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) suggests a significant hydrophobic contribution, which would increase the property value.
- The ester group (**C(=O)OCC**) is polar but less polar than a free carboxylic acid, so it may not reduce the property as much as an **OH** or **COOH** would.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (6-carbon chain + phenyl, property = 0.438).
  - **COCC(=O)N(...)** (ester + complex group, property = 1.824).
  - **CCOc1ccccc1** (ether, property = -0.486).

Given the long chain and ester, the property should be **higher than 0.438** (due to longer chain) but **less than 1.824** (due to simpler ester and no additional polar groups). 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.8 to 1.2**. Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**1.05** (interpolating between similar structures). 

However, looking more closely, **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (6C + phenyl) is 0.438, and adding 4 more carbons + ester would likely increase the value further. A better estimate might be **~1.3**. 

But comparing to **COCC(=O)N(...)** (1.824), which has more polar features, this molecule is less polar, so perhaps **1.2** is more accurate. 

### Final Prediction:
**1.15** (middle ground between the trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. If the property is logP, for example, this would align with expectations for a long-chain ester.) 

---

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is **1.15**.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.811017566473192
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings with multiple substituents, including:
   - Chlorine (Cl) atoms (electron-withdrawing).
   - Nitro group (N(=O)=O, strongly electron-withdrawing).
   - Hydroxyl group (OH, electron-donating).
   - Amide linkage (C(=O)N, polar and moderately electron-withdrawing).

2. **Polarity and functional groups**: The presence of multiple polar groups (OH, C=O, NO₂, Cl) suggests high polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding).

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.52882109): A simpler nitro-chlorobenzene with a lower value.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 1.89450487): Contains an amide linker and chloro/ether substituents, yielding a higher value.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1N(=O)=O** (not in the list, but similar to the given molecule's fragment): Likely higher than -0.528 due to additional Cl.
   - **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (property = 8.59379908): Contains sulfonamide and amide groups, pushing the value much higher.

4. **Key observations**:
   - Nitro groups and amides tend to increase the property value.
   - Multiple Cl atoms and OH groups add to the complexity and polarity.
   - The molecule is more complex than most in the list, likely placing it in the higher range.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the combination of:
- Nitro group (+ contribution, similar to the sulfonamide in the 8.59 example but less extreme).
- Amide linker (+ contribution, as seen in the 1.89 example).
- Multiple Cl and OH substituents (moderate + contribution).

The molecule is less extreme than the sulfonamide example (8.59) but more polar than the simpler nitro-chlorobenzene (-0.52). A reasonable estimate is between **2.0 and 4.0**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 3.25**  
*(This is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or QSAR would be needed.)*

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 59.92373681375968
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly the presence of heavy atoms (e.g., Cl, S, P), aromatic systems, and functional groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl, phosphoryl). The property values increase significantly with:  
1. **High halogen content (especially Cl)** – e.g., `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` (9.59).  
2. **Phosphorus/sulfur-containing groups** – e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (19.12).  
3. **Extended conjugated systems** – e.g., `Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14` (2.85).  

The target molecule, **`COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1`**, has:  
- **Two phosphoryl thioate groups (`P(=S)(OC)`)**, which are highly contributory (cf. the example with one such group at 19.12).  
- **A sulfur-linked biphenyl system**, adding aromaticity and conjugation.  
- **No halogens**, but the dual `P=S` and aromaticity likely compensate.  

### Prediction:  
Given the dual `P=S` moieties and the scaffold resembling high-value examples, the predicted property value is **~15.0–20.0**. A refined estimate based on the examples suggests **~18.5** (slightly below the 19.12 example due to fewer Cl atoms but with added aromatic sulfur).  

**Final answer:** **18.5** (approximate).

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6277588931790757
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule contains a phenol group (**Oc1cccc(c1)**) and a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) attached to the aromatic ring.
   - Similar molecules in the dataset include:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = -0.5834204): Contains an amide and phenol.
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = -0.5474485): Contains a nitro group attached to a toluene ring.
     - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property = -0.61606596): Contains an amine and chloro substituents on the aromatic ring.

2. **Comparison**:
   - The nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) tends to decrease the property value slightly compared to simple aromatic systems (e.g., **CCCC** = -0.68391981).
   - The phenol group (**OH**) has a modest effect, as seen in **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-0.5834204), where the presence of the OH group doesn't drastically increase the value.
   - The nitro group in **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** gives a value of -0.5474485, which is slightly higher than the amine/chloro analog (**Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** = -0.61606596).

3. **Prediction**:
   - Combining the effects of the phenol and nitro groups, the value should be slightly higher than **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-0.5834204) but similar to **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.5474485).
   - The electron-withdrawing nitro group and the electron-donating OH group may partially cancel each other's effects, leading to a value in the same range.

### Predicted Property Value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**:  
**-0.55** (approximate, likely between -0.58 and -0.54).  

This aligns with the trend observed for nitro-substituted aromatic systems with moderate polar substituents.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 16.637248449197333
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly influenced by factors such as molecular size, branching, presence of functional groups (especially oxygen-containing groups like hydroxyls, ethers, and carbonyls), and halogen substitutions. 

The molecule to predict is a large, highly oxygenated carbohydrate (likely an oligosaccharide or polysaccharide derivative) with multiple hydroxyl groups, ether linkages, and significant branching. Comparing it to the examples:

1. **Highly oxygenated molecules** (e.g., sugars or polyols) in the dataset tend to have moderate property values, often in the range of **-0.5 to 5**. For example:
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple sugar) has a value of **-0.53241711**.
   - Larger oxygenated structures like steroids or glycosides (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`) have values around **8.60772915**.

2. **Size and branching**: The given molecule is significantly larger and more branched than most examples, with multiple sugar units linked together. This suggests a higher value due to increased complexity.

3. **Functional groups**: The abundance of hydroxyl (`OH`) and ether (`O`) groups typically increases the property value, but not as dramatically as halogens or aromatic systems. 

Given these observations, the molecule's property value is likely **higher than simple sugars but lower than large halogenated or highly conjugated systems**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **5 to 10**, leaning toward the higher end due to its size and branching. 

### Predicted property value: **7.2** (approximate, based on structural similarity to mid-range examples). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, polar surface area, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.*

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.8934989934953718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptanol-like): -0.352  
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (branched ketone): -0.614  
   - **CCCCCC=O** (aldehyde): -0.567  
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long-chain alcohol): 3.719  
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (very long-chain alcohol): 8.105  
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (alkene): 0.145  

   Hydrocarbons with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -CHO) or long chains tend to have higher values, while simple alkanes/alkenes/alkynes are closer to zero or negative.

2. **Alkynes**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): -0.589  
     This has two nitrile groups, which are polar, but the triple bond itself doesn't seem to strongly increase the property value.  
   - **CCC#C** is a simple alkyne with no other functional groups.

3. **Small, non-polar molecules**:
   - **CC(C)OC(C)C** (ether): -0.587  
   - **CC(=O)C** (ketone): -0.719  
   - **Fc1cccc(F)c1** (difluorobenzene): -0.734  

   Small, non-polar or weakly polar molecules tend to have negative values.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- It is a small, non-polar hydrocarbon with a triple bond (no other functional groups).  
- Similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C** (alkene, 0.145), but alkynes are slightly more polarizable due to the triple bond. However, the lack of other functional groups suggests a value closer to zero but likely negative (like other small hydrocarbons).  
- Comparing to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (-0.589), which has polar nitriles, **CCC#C** should be less negative.  

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCC#C** is:  
**-0.25 to -0.40**.  

A specific value within this range:  
**-0.35**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would align with typical trends for small alkynes.)  

**Final Answer: -0.35**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 7.820086734458927
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, O, S, P). The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

Breaking it down:
1. It contains a **phosphorothioate group (P=S)**, which is highly polarizable and often associated with higher property values (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **19.12365378**, and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** has **11.53267644**).
2. It has **three chlorine atoms** on the aromatic ring, which contribute to higher values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has **2.67890972**).
3. The **ethoxy groups (CCO-)** are less impactful but still contribute to polarity.

Given these observations, the molecule is less complex than the one with a value of **19.12365378** but more complex than simpler chlorinated aromatics. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **5.0 to 8.0**. 

Considering the examples, a precise prediction would be:  
**Predicted property value: 6.84231951**  

This accounts for the phosphorothioate group's strong contribution and the chlorinated aromatic ring's additive effects.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.5949374301143125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., amides, nitro, carbonyl)** tend to have higher property values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1: 0.25058784**, **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1: 0.72445213**).
   - **Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing/donating substituents** often have values in the range of **0.1 to 1.0** (e.g., **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2: 0.03066181**, **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2: 0.48695481**).
   - The **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** is more polar than simple amides or nitro groups, which suggests a higher value than typical aromatic systems but not as extreme as large polyfunctional molecules (e.g., **CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2: 20.47170637** is an outlier due to size and multiple halogens).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.30434723)**: Less polar than our target due to only an amine group.
   - **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1 (0.72445213)**: Similar polarity due to multiple H-bonding groups, but our hydrazide is slightly more polar.
   - **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (-0.53393309)**: Despite having a carbonyl, the fused ring system and lack of additional polar groups reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given the **pyridine + hydrazide combination**, the property value is likely in the **moderate-positive range**, similar to other polar aromatic systems but higher than simple amines or halogens. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.85**  

This accounts for:
- The **polarity of the hydrazide group** (higher than amides).
- The **aromatic pyridine ring** (contributing modestly).
- No large hydrophobic or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) to skew the value significantly higher or lower. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend of increasing values with polarity/H-bonding capacity in the given examples.)

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 32.66799890856247
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a property value of **2.96548223**. The presence of P(=S) often correlates with higher property values (e.g., >2 in the examples).
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether linkage may contribute to the property value, though its exact impact is less clear from the examples.
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are present in many of the given molecules, but their contribution varies. For example:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** has a value of **-0.67754096** (low due to small size and symmetry).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** has a value of **1.89450487** (higher due to larger structure and substitutions).
4. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: This is a common feature, but its contribution depends on substitutions. Here, it is substituted with a methyl group (C), which may slightly increase the property value.
5. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are neutral contributors unless they are very long or branched. Here, they are moderate in length.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (value = **2.96548223**), which also has a P(=S) group and aromatic substitutions. Our molecule lacks aromaticity but has a larger aliphatic structure and an amide group.
- Another relevant example is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (value = **1.89450487**), which has an amide and aromatic substitutions. Our molecule is less aromatic but has the P(=S) group, which likely increases the value.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The P(=S) group is a strong positive contributor (likely adding ~2-3 to the value).
- The amide and cyclohexane ring are moderate contributors (adding ~0.5-1).
- The lack of aromaticity may reduce the value slightly compared to aromatic P(=S) examples.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is likely in the range of **2.5 to 3.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.1**  

This aligns with the trend that P(=S)-containing molecules with additional functional groups (like amides) tend to have values in this range.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.17325777317060576
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, functional groups, and size. The property values tend to increase with larger, more complex structures (e.g., polycyclic systems, multiple functional groups, or conjugated systems) and decrease for smaller, simpler, or nonpolar molecules.

For the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or polarity, the property value is expected to be low (negative or near zero). Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol): -0.33874327  
  (Octane is even less polar than heptanol, so its value should be lower.)
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -0.51350838  
  (Octane is fully saturated and less polar than this, but the double bond here may not significantly lower the value further.)
- **CC34CC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)C=CC12C)C3CC(O)C4(O)C(=O)CO**: 11.85590523  
  (This is a highly complex, polar molecule, illustrating the contrast with octane.)

Given these comparisons, octane (**CCCCCCCC**) is likely to have a property value slightly lower than **CCCCCCCO** but not drastically different from other simple hydrocarbons. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where simple, nonpolar alkanes have values in the range of -0.2 to -0.8 in the given dataset.

Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 8.029096824848132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** with property **7.51825741** and **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** with property **13.74227481**).
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: Present in one of the rings, similar to many examples (e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** with property **11.17061451**).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups are present, which can increase polarity and property value.
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: A terminal alkyne, which is somewhat polar but not heavily represented in the examples. Its effect is likely minor compared to the steroid core and ketone.
5. **Ring fusion and size**: The molecule has fused 6-membered rings, similar to the high-property examples.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are the steroid-like molecules with ketone and hydroxyl groups, which have property values in the range of **7.5 to 13.7**.
- The presence of two hydroxyl groups and a ketone suggests a higher value than the simpler steroid example (**7.51825741**), but the lack of additional functional groups (like fluorine or more ketones) suggests it won't reach the highest values (~13.7).
- The alkyne group may slightly increase the property compared to purely hydrocarbon steroids.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (7.51825741)** but with an additional hydroxyl group and alkyne, the property should be **higher than 7.5 but less than 11.2**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 9.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is based on the trend that more polar/functionalized steroid-like structures have higher values in the given examples.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 68.03531934282495
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, aromaticity, functional groups, and halogenation. The property tends to increase with:

1. **Aromatic systems and fused rings**: Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) tend to have higher values (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` = 2.693, `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` = 2.683).
2. **Halogenation (Cl, Br, I)**: Heavily halogenated aromatics often have higher values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = -0.166, `Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` = 1.968).
3. **Polar or charged groups (e.g., sulfonamides, nitro groups)**: These can significantly increase the value (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c1cc(ccc1Cl)C2(O)NC(=O)c3ccccc23` = 5.167).
4. **Small or aliphatic molecules**: These tend to have lower (often negative) values (e.g., `CCCCOCCO` = -0.489, `CCSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C` = 1.804).

The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Highly oxygenated**: Multiple ether (`O`), hydroxyl (`OH`), and carbonyl (`C=O`) groups.
2. **Fused ring systems**: Contains multiple fused rings (some aromatic, some aliphatic).
3. **Heterocycles and sugar-like moieties**: The `OCO` (dioxolane) and `COC` (furanose/pyranose-like) fragments suggest carbohydrate-like complexity.
4. **No halogens or charged groups**: Lacks sulfonamides, nitro groups, or heavy halogens.

### Comparison to examples:
- The closest analogs are large, oxygenated polycyclic systems (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` = 46.258), but this is an extreme outlier (possibly a steroid or terpene). 
- More typical oxygenated aromatics (e.g., `COc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.519) have low values.
- The presence of multiple fused rings and oxygenated groups suggests a higher value than simple aromatics but not as extreme as the steroid example.

### Predicted property value:
Given the complexity and oxygen content, but lack of halogens or charged groups, the value is likely in the **mid-to-high positive range**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**~15.0** (closer to the steroid-like example but adjusted downward due to lack of hydrophobic/steroid core).

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, bioactivity—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6319835092155264
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure and substituents.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol derivatives** (with -OH group on benzene):
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -0.62775889
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above, repeated): -0.62615436
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol): -0.62775889  
     *These suggest that phenol with strong electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO₂) have property values around -0.63.*

2. **Chlorobenzene derivatives**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): -0.28311488
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): 0.48695481  
     *Chloro substituents alone seem to give values in the range of -0.28 to +0.49, depending on other groups.*

3. **Phenol with halogen substituents**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol): 0.37897375  
     *Here, the presence of -I and -C#N (electron-withdrawing) gives a positive value, but the -OH may counteract this.*
   - **Oc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)...** (complex polyphenol): 68.03531934  
     *This is an outlier due to the large, complex structure.*

4. **Simple phenol (no substituents)**:
   - Not explicitly given, but **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is similar to nitrophenol but with -Cl instead of -NO₂.  
     *Since -Cl is less electron-withdrawing than -NO₂, the property value should be less negative than -0.63.*

5. **Other chloro-aromatics**:
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene): -0.18508502  
     *This suggests chloroaromatics without -OH are less negative.*

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- The molecule is phenol with a -Cl substituent (electron-withdrawing but less so than -NO₂).
- Compared to nitrophenol (-0.63), the value should be less negative but still negative due to the -OH group.
- Compared to chlorobenzene derivatives (e.g., -0.28 for chloroiodobenzene), the -OH adds more negativity.
- A reasonable estimate is between -0.40 and -0.50.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.45**  
*(This is a rough estimate based on the trends. The actual value would likely be close to this range.)*

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.7272692386997851
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **ClCC#CC**: A chloroalkyne fragment (rare in the examples, but halogens and triple bonds are present in other molecules).
   - **OC(=O)N**: A carbamate group (similar to amides/esters in the examples).
   - **c1cccc(Cl)c1**: A chlorinated benzene ring (common in the examples, often contributing positively to the property when multiple halogens are present).

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: Property = **1.97629285** (contains multiple halogens, amide, and complex structure).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **3.58127337** (highly chlorinated, aromatic).
   - **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F**: Property = **2.52016456** (multiple halogens, amides, aromatic).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value (e.g., compare benzene vs. chlorobenzene).
   - Carbamates/amides (OC(=O)N) are present in molecules with mid-to-high property values (e.g., **8.01638688** for **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**).
   - The alkyne fragment (**C#C**) is less common, but its contribution is likely small compared to the aromatic and polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- Two chlorine atoms (one aliphatic, one aromatic),
- A carbamate group (polar and likely increasing the property),
- An aromatic ring (contributing to the baseline),

the property value should be **moderate to high**, similar to other chlorinated aromatic molecules with polar functional groups. 

Comparing to the most similar examples:
- The molecule is less chlorinated than **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 3.58) but more polar than simpler chlorinated aromatics.
- It resembles **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F** (property = 2.52) but with fewer halogens and a simpler carbamate.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **~2.0 to 3.0**. Splitting the difference, I predict:  
**Property = 2.45** (specific value chosen based on structural similarity to mid-range examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 3.400567333555389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, presence of halogens (Cl, Br), aromatic systems, and functional groups like alcohols, amines, and carbonyls.

### Structural Analysis of the Given Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**), contributing to lipophilicity and polarity.
   - A pyrimidine-like heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**), which is aromatic and polar due to nitrogen atoms.
   - Another chlorinated phenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**), adding further lipophilicity and halogen effects.

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (one with Cl substitution).
   - A heterocyclic aromatic ring (pyrimidine-like, **c2cncnc2**).
   - A polar hydroxyl group.
   - Two chlorine atoms, which often increase the property value (as seen in examples like **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has a value of 3.355).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**, **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) tend to have higher property values (0.5 to 3.5 range).
- The presence of a heterocycle (like **c2cncnc2**) may further increase the value due to additional polarity and aromaticity (similar to **Nc1nc[nH]n1**, though this is simpler and has a negative value).
- The hydroxyl group adds polarity, but its effect is moderated by the bulky aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the structural complexity, two chlorines, two aromatic rings, and a polar heterocycle, the property value is likely in the **1.5 to 2.5 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.95**  

This aligns with examples like:
- **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (2.454), which has similar halogen and aromatic features.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (1.894), which has polar groups and chlorinated aromatics.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.6708383958349025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have more negative values (e.g., `CCCCBr` = -0.491, `CCCCCC=O` = -0.567).
   - Branching or cyclic structures can slightly increase the value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` = -0.133).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) = -0.533 (similar to `CCCC(=O)OCC` = -0.533).
     - Esters with longer alkyl groups (e.g., `CCCCOC(=O)C` in the examples) are not directly listed, but esters generally have moderately negative values.
   - **Aldehydes (RCHO)**:
     - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal) = -0.567.
     - The aldehyde group tends to lower the property value.
   - **Ketones (RCOR')**:
     - `CCCCCCCCC(=O)C` (2-nonanone) = 0.296, suggesting ketones may have higher values than aldehydes or esters.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
   - Ethers (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` = -0.126) seem to have less negative values than esters or aldehydes.
   - The presence of multiple oxygen atoms or polar groups can increase the value (e.g., `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` = 0.226).

4. **Specific Comparison**:
   - `CCCCOC=O` (butyl formate) is an ester with a 4-carbon chain and a formyl group (HCO-). 
   - It is structurally similar to `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate, -0.533) but with a shorter ester group (formate instead of acetate).
   - The formyl group (HCO-) is more polar than an acetyl group (CH3CO-), which might slightly lower the value compared to ethyl acetate.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Esters with 4-5 carbons (e.g., `CCCC(=O)OCC` = -0.533) have values around -0.5 to -0.6.
- The formyl group (HCO-) may further reduce the value slightly due to higher polarity.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is approximately:  
**-0.55** (likely between -0.53 and -0.60).  

For specificity, I will predict:  
**-0.56** (similar to `CCCCCC=O` = -0.567, adjusted for ester vs. aldehyde).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.56**

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8516425742625939
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), we can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **-0.75503001**.
   - This is a simple chlorinated alkane with two chlorines on adjacent carbons.
2. **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of **0.08105693**.
   - This is a fully chlorinated methane.
3. **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.08105693**.
   - This is a heavily chlorinated aromatic compound.
4. **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a property value of **-0.75668374**.
   - This is a simple halogenated alkane with a bromine.

### Analysis of **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):
- It is structurally similar to **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane), but with fewer carbons and chlorines on the same carbon.
- The presence of two chlorines on a single carbon (like in **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) tends to increase the property value slightly compared to chlorines on separate carbons (as in **ClCCCl**).
- However, **ClCCl** is less chlorinated than **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, so its value should be lower than **0.08105693** but higher than **-0.75503001**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **ClCCl** likely has a property value slightly higher than **ClCCCl** but still negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.5317384923704782
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) has a property value of **-0.71841561**.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a value of **-0.71841561** (same as phenol, suggesting hydroxyl groups dominate).
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **-0.17747252**, indicating that alkyl substitution increases the property value compared to phenol.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Adding methyl groups (e.g., **CC1CCCO1** with value **-0.66005667**) tends to increase the property value slightly compared to non-alkylated analogs.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1O** has two methyl groups and one hydroxyl, similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** but with slightly less branching.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl) tend to have negative values unless balanced by hydrophobic or bulky substituents.

### Prediction for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
- This is a **2-methylphenol (o-cresol)** with an additional methyl group at another position. 
- Compared to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (value **-0.17747252**), this molecule has less branching but similar substitution. 
- The property value is likely slightly lower due to reduced steric effects but higher than phenol (**-0.71841561**) due to the two methyl groups.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **-0.30** to **-0.20**. Given the examples, I would assign:  
**-0.25** (interpolating between phenol and more alkylated analogs). 

However, looking closely at **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (**-0.17747252**), which is more alkylated, this molecule (less alkylated) should be slightly lower. Thus, a refined estimate is:  
**-0.35**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is **-0.35**.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.3536188550458033
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, we can observe the following trends:

1. **Heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **1.96892953**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **2.67890972**.

2. The target molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with **5 chlorine atoms**, symmetrically distributed across two aromatic rings. This is similar to the second example above but with slightly fewer chlorines (5 vs. 7).

3. Comparing the two heavily chlorinated examples:
   - The first has 5 chlorines and a value of **1.96892953**.
   - The second has 7 chlorines and a value of **2.67890972**.

4. The target molecule has **5 chlorines**, so its value should be **slightly lower than 1.96892953** but still in the same range due to the symmetric substitution pattern.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is approximately:

**1.85** (estimated between 1.7 and 2.0 based on the examples). 

This accounts for the high chlorine count but slightly fewer chlorines than the example with 1.96892953.

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.8034665192225898
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = **0.14570431**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = **-0.17325777**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = **-0.17220643**
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene) is a branched alkene, similar to nonene but with more branching.

2. **Effect of Branching and Unsaturation**:
   - Branching tends to slightly decrease the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., octane vs. branched alkanes).
   - The presence of a double bond (alkene) increases the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., nonene vs. octane).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = **-0.22456963**
   - **CC(C)=CC3C...** (complex branched alkene): Property = **8.06142906** (but this is a much larger/functionalized molecule, not directly comparable).
   - The simplest comparable molecule is **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene), with a property of **0.14570431**.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- Isoprene is a smaller and more branched alkene than nonene. Branching typically reduces the property slightly, but the double bond increases it. 
- Given that nonene (linear) has a value of **0.14570431**, isoprene (branched) would likely have a slightly lower value but still positive due to the double bond.
- A reasonable estimate is **between 0.0 and 0.1**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.05** (specific value based on interpolation of trends). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the examples, but it aligns with the observed trends for small branched alkenes.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8516425742625939
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and the presence of certain functional groups or halogens (e.g., Cl, F). Smaller, simpler molecules with fewer substituents or less structural complexity tend to have lower (more negative) property values, while larger, more complex molecules or those with multiple halogens or functional groups tend to have higher (more positive) property values.

The molecule in question is **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH₂Cl₂). This is a very small molecule with only two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon. Comparing it to similar small molecules in the dataset:

1. **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene, C₂Cl₄) has a property value of **-0.65806751**. This is a slightly larger molecule but still small and highly chlorinated.
2. **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)** (hexachlorobenzene, C₆Cl₆) has a property value of **4.67516891**, but this is a much larger and more complex aromatic system with many chlorines.
3. **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a complex polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **5.80746734**, but this is a highly complex and large molecule.

Given that **ClCCl** is smaller and simpler than all of these, and the trend that smaller/less complex chlorinated molecules have lower property values, we can predict that its property value would be **lower (more negative)** than that of **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (-0.65806751).

A reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** would be slightly higher (less negative) than the smallest aliphatic chlorinated molecule in the dataset (**ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**), but still negative. 

### Predicted property value for **ClCCl**: **-0.55** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

This is a rough estimate given the limited examples of very small chlorinated molecules in the dataset. If more examples were available, a more precise prediction could be made.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.3143583311500623
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (given in the examples) has a property value of **-0.3167471**. This is a tri-chlorinated phenol (2,4,6-trichlorophenol).
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** (the query) is also a tri-chlorinated phenol (2,3,6-trichlorophenol), with a very similar structure but slightly different chlorine positions.

2. **Effect of Chlorine**:
   - Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value compared to non-halogenated analogs, but the exact value depends on their positions and interactions with other substituents (e.g., OH group).
   - In the given example, the tri-chlorinated phenol has a moderately negative value (-0.3167471), suggesting that the OH group and chlorine substitutions balance out to a slightly negative property.

3. **Positional Effects**:
   - The query molecule has chlorines at positions 2, 3, and 6, while the example has them at 2, 4, and 6. The 2,4,6-substitution is symmetric, while 2,3,6 is less symmetric. This asymmetry might slightly alter the property, but not drastically.

4. **Comparison to Other Phenols**:
   - **Oc1ccc(CC=C)cc1** (with an allyl group) has a value of -0.30686984, close to the tri-chlorinated phenol.
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** (hydroquinone) is not in the examples, but simpler phenols with fewer substitutions tend to have more negative values.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.3167471), the query molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should have a very close property value. The slight difference in chlorine positions may not significantly change the property, so we can estimate a similar value. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **-0.32**. 

*(This is a rough estimate based on the closest analog in the given data. For higher precision, more examples or a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed.)*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 68.03531934282495
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the range of property values observed in the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: Similar to examples like `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (property = -0.39354094) and `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = -0.62775889), but with more substitutions.
2. **Multiple oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., furan-like OCO rings)**: Seen in `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 2.86917814), which has many hydroxyl and ether groups.
3. **Large molecular size and polycyclic framework**: Similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = 12.61638514) or `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property = 5.06853283), which are steroidal/polycyclic structures with high property values.
4. **Presence of carbonyl (C=O) and ether (C-O-C) groups**: These are polar and can increase the property value, as seen in many examples.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to large, oxygen-rich polycyclic structures (e.g., steroids, carbohydrates, or complex heterocycles) with property values in the range of **2 to 13**.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings with polar substituents (OCH3, OH) and fused heterocycles suggests a higher value, likely in the **5 to 10 range**.
- The exact value depends on the balance between polar groups (increasing the property) and nonpolar regions (decreasing it). Given the dominance of polar/oxygenated features, I estimate a value closer to the higher end.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarity to high-value examples (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` with value = 10.19029481), but accounting for slightly less polarity, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 8.75** (approximate, likely in the 8.5–9.5 range). 

This is a rough estimate given the complexity and lack of a clear linear trend in the examples. For a precise prediction, computational tools or a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7694005273733243
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group, a **hydrazine (NH)** group, and a **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent. The ring also has a **carbonyl (C=O)** group, which is polar and can influence the property.
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Thiomethyl (CS)**: Similar to sulfur-containing groups in other molecules (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**, property = 2.26566814).
   - **Tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)**: Bulky hydrophobic group, seen in **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 1.57292405).
   - **Hydrazine (NH)** and **carbonyl (C=O)**: Polar groups that may increase the property value compared to purely hydrophobic structures.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 1.57292405) has a somewhat similar structure with a heterocyclic ring, sulfur, and tert-butyl groups.
   - The presence of **CS** and **C=O** may push the property higher, similar to **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (property = 2.26566814).

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of polar groups (C=O, NH) and hydrophobic bulk (tert-butyl), along with the sulfur atom, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 1.85**  

This balances the contributions from the polar and non-polar components, aligning with the trends observed in the examples.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3224851128010315
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: Small hydrocarbons like **CC** (ethane) have low negative values (e.g., -0.94). Larger alkanes/alkenes (e.g., **CCCC/C=C/C**) have slightly higher but still negative values (e.g., -0.51).
2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Bare aromatic systems (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1**, aniline) have negative values (e.g., -0.73). 
   - Substituted aromatics with polar groups (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**) also tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.66).
   - Aromatic systems with multiple rings (e.g., **o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, dibenzofuran) have values closer to zero (e.g., 0.026).
3. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - Esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) have negative values (e.g., -0.36).
   - Aromatic esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, ethyl benzoate) are not explicitly in the examples, but similar structures (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OC**, butyl acetate) have values around -0.39 to -0.36.
4. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) tend to reduce the property value (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)CO** has -0.60).
   - Halogens (e.g., **Cl**, **Br**) can slightly increase the value (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** has -0.185).
5. **Complexity and Size**:
   - Larger molecules with multiple functional groups or rings (e.g., steroids, polyhalogenated compounds) have high positive values (e.g., **ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl** has 9.59).

### Prediction for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (Ethyl benzoate):
- This is an aromatic ester with a benzene ring and an ethyl ester group (**-COOEt**).
- Similar molecules:
  - **CCCC(=O)OC** (butyl acetate): -0.39 (aliphatic ester).
  - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether): -0.018 (aromatic ether).
  - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a benzofuranone derivative): -0.10.
- The aromatic ring may slightly increase the value compared to aliphatic esters, but the ester group will keep it negative.

Given these observations, the property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.1**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (interpolating between similar structures). 

However, looking more closely at **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a benzofuranone with two carbonyls, value = -0.10) and **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether, value = -0.018), ethyl benzoate (one carbonyl, one aromatic ring) would likely be slightly more negative than these. 

A more precise estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.20**.  

But to align better with the trend of esters (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC** at -0.36), and considering the aromaticity slightly offsets the negativity, the final prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.28**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarities.)
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.18922654270417172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Br-substituted):**
   - **CI (iodomethane):** Property value = -0.65354185  
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl (hexachlorobiphenyl):** Property value = 0.87148858  
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene):** Property value = 0.01764665  
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O (brominated heterocycle):** Property value = 0.68105806  

   Halogenated compounds show a range of values, but simple alkyl halides (like CI) tend to have negative values, while larger/aromatic halogenated compounds can have positive values.

2. **Alkane Chains:**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC (4-heptanone):** Property value = -0.41269749  
   - **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol):** Property value = -0.33874327  
   - **CCCCCCC=C (1-octene):** Property value = -0.33863856  

   Longer alkyl chains (without polar groups) tend to have negative property values, typically between -0.3 and -0.4.

3. **Effect of Bromine Substitution:**
   - Comparing **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol, -0.33874327)** with **CCCCCCCBr (1-bromoheptane)**, the bromine substitution is expected to slightly decrease the property value (more negative) because halogens like Br are less polar than OH but still introduce some electronegativity.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- The molecule is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane), structurally similar to 1-octanol but with Br replacing OH.  
- Given that **CCCCCCCO** has a value of -0.33874327 and **CI** has -0.65354185, **CCCCCCCBr** should lie between these two.  
- Br is less polar than OH but more polar than pure hydrocarbons, so the value should be more negative than **CCCCCCCO** but less negative than **CI**.  

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **-0.45 ± 0.05**, considering the trends.  

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on analogous examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The property could be related to logP, dipole moment, or another molecular descriptor.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.0105844823159527
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC, CC#C, C=Cc1ccccc1)** tend to have negative property values (around -0.5 to -0.9).  
2. **Oxygen-containing small molecules (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O)** also tend to have negative values (around -0.3 to -0.5).  
3. **Very small molecules (e.g., NC(=O)N, NC(N)=NC#N)** have strongly negative values (close to -1).  
4. **Methanol (CH3OH)** is not explicitly listed, but **CO** (methanol without explicit hydrogens, or formaldehyde if interpreted as HCHO) is an even simpler oxygen-containing molecule.  

Given that:  
- **CCC** (propane) has a value of **-0.883**,  
- **NC(=O)N** (urea) has **-0.972**,  
- **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O** (a sugar derivative) has **-0.336**,  

**CO** (formaldehyde or methanol fragment) is likely even simpler and more polar than propane but less complex than sugars. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.7 and -1.0**.  

**Predicted property value for CO: ~ -0.85**  

*(Note: If "CO" is interpreted as methanol (CH3OH), the value might be slightly higher, e.g., ~ -0.7, but the trend suggests a strongly negative value due to small size and polarity.)*  

**Final prediction: -0.85**
