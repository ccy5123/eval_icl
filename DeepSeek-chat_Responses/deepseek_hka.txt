SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe that the property value tends to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate), we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl hexanoate) has a property value of **-0.53**.
2. `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is a longer-chain version of the same ester functional group.

Longer aliphatic chains tend to have minimal impact on the property value when the functional group remains the same (e.g., `CCCCCC` and `CCCCCCCC` both have a value of **0.0**). The ester group (`(=O)OC`) seems to consistently contribute around **-0.53** in the examples.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is likely the same as the shorter-chain ester example:  

**Predicted property value: -0.53**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -1.2199999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl group and NH). This is a polar, heterocyclic system with potential hydrogen-bonding capability (NH and C=O).
2. **Substituents**: A **chlorine (Cl)** is attached to the benzene ring, which adds some electronegativity and lipophilicity.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Cl-substituted aromatic rings and polar groups** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, -0.4; Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, 0.18) tend to have property values around **-0.4 to 0.5**.
   - Molecules with **lactam/lactone-like structures** (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, -1.39; O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1, -1.39) tend to have more negative values (~-1.39) due to strong polarity/H-bonding.
   - The presence of **NH and C=O** in a fused ring here suggests moderate polarity, but the Cl substitution may offset some of that.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar heterocycle (which would push the value toward ~-1.0 to -1.5) and the Cl substitution (which tends to raise it toward ~-0.4 to 0.5), the likely value is **intermediate**, similar to other Cl-substituted polar aromatics. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.9** (closer to the polar heterocycle influence but tempered by the Cl). 

However, looking at very similar structures like:  
- **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (-1.03, polar heterocycle with Cl and carbonyls)  
- **c1cncnc1** (-0.92, polar aromatic heterocycle without Cl)  

The predicted value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is likely:  
**-1.0** (rounded from -0.9 to -1.0 based on closer analogs).  

### Final Answer:  
**-1.0**

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Group**: The molecule contains a **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to a tertiary carbon (isopropyl group, **CC(C)**). Nitro groups are highly polar and electron-withdrawing, which often contributes to more negative property values in the given dataset.
2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a property value of **-1.43**. This molecule also contains a nitro group (though attached to a heterocycle) and other polar/electron-withdrawing groups.
   - **NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O** (property **-1.79**) and **NC(=O)CCl** (property **-0.24**) show that polar/electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or amides) tend to push the property toward negative values.
   - The nitro group in **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is less sterically hindered than in some of the cyclic examples, but its strong electron-withdrawing nature is dominant.

### Comparison:
- The nitro group in **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler (aliphatic) but similarly electron-withdrawing as in **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (-1.43). However, the absence of additional polar groups (like the ether/alcohol in the latter) might make its effect slightly less negative.
- The property is likely more negative than **NC(=O)CCl** (-0.24) but less negative than **NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O** (-1.79).

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the lack of additional stabilizing features, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.2**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the dataset's trends. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled, but this aligns with the nitro group's impact in similar molecules.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -1.0000000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (similar to **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**, which has a value of **-0.92**). This suggests a moderately negative property value due to the rigid, hydrophobic core.
2. **Polar functional groups**:
   - A hydroxyl group (**-OH**) at one position.
   - A carbonyl group (**C=O**) in the form of an aldehyde (**-CHO**) at the terminal position.
   - Another carbonyl (**C=O**) in a cyclic context (like in the example with **-0.92**).
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and has significant hydrophobic character, but the polar groups (OH and C=O) introduce some polarity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **-0.92**), which is also a steroid-like molecule with carbonyl groups. 
- The additional **-OH** and **-CHO** groups in the given molecule would likely make it slightly more polar, thus decreasing the property value further (more negative).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the example with **-0.92** but with added polarity, the predicted property value for **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO** is:

**-1.05**  

(Reasoning: Slightly more negative than **-0.92** due to the additional polar groups, but not as extreme as highly conjugated or polyaromatic systems like **-2.6** or **-3.15**.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -2.4699999999999993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens (F, Cl) are present in many of the examples, and they tend to contribute negatively to the property value (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.2, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.99).
2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide groups (C(=O)N), which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. Similar groups (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1: -1.38, NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -1.09) suggest a negative contribution.
3. **Halogen Substituents**: Fluorine and chlorine substituents are present. Fluorine tends to have a more negative impact than chlorine (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.99 vs. Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.2).
4. **Bridging Group**: The two aromatic rings are connected by a urea-like linker (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is highly polar and likely to further reduce the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**: -1.38 (amide + aromatic ring)
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**: -1.09 (thiourea + aromatic ring)
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.2 (dichlorobenzene)
- **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**: -0.99 (trifluoromethylbenzene)
- **Oc1ccccn1**: -1.05 (hydroxy-pyridine)

The presence of two amide groups and multiple halogens (F and Cl) suggests a more negative value than most of these, likely in the range of -1.3 to -1.6. The urea-like linker may push it further toward the lower end.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combined effects of the polar amides, aromatic rings, and halogen substituents, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is:

**-1.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Simple Ethers:**
   - **CCCCCC(O)CC**: -0.04  
     (Long hydrocarbon chain with one hydroxyl group)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**: -0.04  
     (Branched hydrocarbon with one hydroxyl group)
   - **CCCCCO**: -0.04  
     (Linear hydrocarbon with one hydroxyl group)
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.0  
     (Fully saturated branched hydrocarbon)
   - **CC1CCCO1**: -0.04  
     (Cyclic ether with hydrocarbon substituents)

   These examples suggest that simple hydrocarbons or ethers with no strong polar or functional groups tend to have property values close to **0.0 or -0.04**.

2. **Ethers:**
   - **CCOC(=O)CC**: -0.53  
     (This is an ester, not a simple ether, so it has a more negative value due to the carbonyl group.)
   - **CCCOC(C)C** is a simple ether (propyl isopropyl ether), similar in simplicity to the hydrocarbons/ethers above.

3. **Effect of Oxygen in Ethers:**
   - The presence of an ether linkage (R-O-R') does not seem to significantly lower the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** is 0.0, while **CC1CCCO1** is -0.04). Thus, the ether oxygen does not strongly influence the property.

### Prediction for **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a simple ether with no strongly polar or functional groups (just alkyl groups and an oxygen). 
- It is structurally similar to **CCCCCO** (-0.04) but with an ether linkage instead of a hydroxyl. 
- The ether linkage is less polar than a hydroxyl, so the property value might be slightly closer to 0.0 than -0.04. However, the examples show that even hydroxyl groups in hydrocarbons give -0.04, so the ether is likely similar.

Given the consistency in the examples for such structures, the most reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C: -0.04**

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.8400000000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, here's the reasoning for predicting its property value:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)** like halogens (Cl, Br, F), nitro groups, and carbonyls (C=O) tend to decrease the property value (more negative).  
   - Example:  
     - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (highly chlorinated) → **0.18**  
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (less chlorinated) → **-0.2**  
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (Br + C=O) → **-0.83**  

2. **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)** like alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`) or methoxy (`OCH3`) tend to increase the property value (less negative or positive).  
   - Example:  
     - `CCC(C)CC` (pure alkyl) → **0.0**  
     - `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (methoxy + Cl) → **-0.69**  

3. **Heterocycles with EWGs** (e.g., pyridones, lactams) often have strongly negative values.  
   - Example:  
     - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (imide with alkyl) → **-1.39**  
     - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (polycyclic with N) → **-2.02**  

4. **Bromine Substitution**:  
   - Bromine is less electronegative than Cl but still an EWG.  
   - Example: `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **-0.83**.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- **Structure**:  
  - A substituted uracil-like heterocycle with:  
    - Two carbonyls (C=O, strong EWGs).  
    - Bromine (EWG).  
    - An alkyl group (`CCC(C)`, EDG).  
    - An NH group (weakly donating but in a conjugated system).  
- **Comparison to Similar Examples**:  
  - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (Br + C=O) → **-0.83**.  
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (imide with alkyl) → **-1.39**.  
  - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (polycyclic N) → **-2.02**.  
  - The target has **two carbonyls + Br + alkyl**, placing it between these examples.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong EWGs (2×C=O, Br) and moderate EDG (alkyl), the value is likely **more negative than -1.39 but less extreme than -2.02**.  

**Final Prediction: -1.65** (similar to other heterocycles with mixed EWGs/EDGs).

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.5599999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings** generally contribute negatively to the property value. The more conjugated/aromatic rings, the more negative the value tends to be.
   - Example: **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a very negative value of **-3.12**.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system) has **-2.54**.
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (two fused aromatic rings) has **-1.3**.

2. **Biphenyl-like structures** (two benzene rings linked directly or with small connectors) tend to have moderately negative values:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (similar to biphenyl but fused) has **-2.54**.
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (two fused rings with small substituents) has **-1.3**.
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (two aromatic rings with an aliphatic linker) has **-0.78**.

3. **Simple biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2)** is less conjugated than fused systems but still has two aromatic rings. Its value should be less negative than fused systems but more negative than single-ring aromatics.

### Comparison:
- Single benzene ring with simple substituents (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccccc1C**) has **-0.78**.
- Fused biphenyl-like systems range from **-1.3** to **-2.54**.
- The given molecule is a **non-fused biphenyl**, so its value should be between **-0.78** and **-1.3**.

### Prediction:
Given the lack of fusion (less conjugation than fused systems) but two aromatic rings, a reasonable estimate is **-1.0**. However, looking at similar structures:
- **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (fused, **-2.54**) is much more conjugated.
- **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (fused, **-1.3**) is slightly more conjugated.

Thus, for **non-fused biphenyl**, the value is likely closer to **-1.0** to **-1.2**. A precise estimate based on the examples is **-1.1**.

### Final Answer:
**-1.1**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.35
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains** (e.g., **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1**, **CCC1CCCCC1**, **CCCC(C)(C)C**) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups that significantly alter the property (e.g., polar groups, halogens, or conjugated systems).

2. The presence of a **thiol group (-SH)** in **CCCCS** is somewhat polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing or donating as other functional groups in the dataset (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, or halogens). 

3. Comparing to similar molecules:
   - **CC(C)I** (iodoalkane) has a value of **0.73** due to the heavy polarizable iodine.
   - **CC1CO1** (epoxide) has a value of **-0.04** due to the slightly polar ether oxygen.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (simple alkane) has a value of **0.0**.

The thiol group is more polar than a simple alkane but less polar than halogens or carbonyls. Thus, the property value for **CCCCS** is likely slightly negative but close to zero.

### Predicted property value for **CCCCS**: **-0.1**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on the trend in the dataset. If the property is logP or a similar descriptor, the thiol's modest hydrophilicity would justify a small negative value.)  

However, looking back at the examples, **CC(C)I** (with iodine) is **0.73**, while **CC1CO1** (with an ether oxygen) is **-0.04**. Since sulfur is less polar than oxygen but more polar than pure hydrocarbons, a reasonable interpolation suggests a value closer to **0.0** but slightly negative.  

Given the lack of exact thiol examples in the dataset, the safest prediction is:  

**Predicted property value: -0.1**  

(If forced to pick from the closest examples, I'd round to **0.0** due to the weak effect of the thiol in this context.)  

But to be precise, based on the polarity trend: **-0.1**.  

(If the property is logP, thiols are slightly less hydrophobic than alkanes, justifying a small negative value.)  

Final answer: **-0.1**
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - The property values seem to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, which measures hydrophobicity. Higher values indicate more hydrophobic (nonpolar) molecules, while lower values indicate more hydrophilic (polar) molecules.
   - **Alkanes and simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**, **CC(C)CC(C)O**) typically have values close to **0.0** or slightly negative if they contain polar groups like **-OH**.
   - **Polar functional groups** (e.g., **-OH**, **-CO**, **-NO2**, **-Cl**, **-Br**) reduce the property value (make it more negative).
   - **Aromatic rings** and **heterocycles** often contribute to negative values, especially if substituted with polar groups.

2. **Structure of CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a branched alkane (**C5H12** backbone) with a terminal **-OH** group (hydrophilic).
   - Similar molecules in the examples:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** → Property = **-0.04**
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** → Property = **-0.04**
     - **CCCCOC** → Property = **-0.04**
   - The **-OH** group introduces slight polarity, but the bulky hydrophobic alkyl chain (**CCCC(C)(C)**) counterbalances it.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule is structurally similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** and **CC(C)CC(C)O**, which both have a property value of **-0.04**.
   - The terminal **-OH** is slightly more exposed than in the branched examples, but the overall hydrophobicity is similar.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is **-0.04**. 

This aligns with the trend observed for branched alkanes with a single polar group (e.g., **-OH**), where the property value is close to neutral but slightly negative due to the polar group.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -1.2999999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). Its structure consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings).
- A methyl group (`-CH3`) attached to one of the rings.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Naphthalene-like structures**:
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-1.3**.
   - `c1ccccc1` (benzene) has a value of **-0.78**.
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (dimethylbenzene) has a value of **-0.78**.
   - `Cc1ccc(C)cc1` (toluene-like) has a value of **-0.78**.

2. **Key observations**:
   - Adding a methyl group to benzene (toluene) does not change the value from benzene (`-0.78`).
   - Fusing two benzene rings (naphthalene) likely decreases the value further (more negative).
   - The given methyl-naphthalene (`Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12`) has a value of **-1.3**, which is more negative than benzene or toluene.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is very similar to the given example `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (both are methylnaphthalenes, just with the methyl group at a slightly different position). The property value is likely close to **-1.3**. 

Small positional changes (e.g., methyl at position 1 vs. position 2) may not drastically affect the property, so the value should be similar. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **-1.3**.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -1.65
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Hydantoin Core**: Molecules with a hydantoin-like core (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**, property = **-1.65**) tend to have negative property values around **-1.5 to -2.0**.
   - The given molecule has a very similar hydantoin core but with a slightly larger substituent **(C(C)CCC)** instead of just **(C)**.

2. **Alkyl and Alkene Substituents**: 
   - The substituent **C(C)CCC** is a branched alkyl chain, which is less polar than aromatic or electronegative groups. 
   - The **CC=C** (alkene) group is present, similar to the training example with **CC=C** (property = **-1.65**).

3. **Effect of Larger Substituent**: 
   - The additional **C(C)CCC** group is hydrophobic and slightly larger than the **C** in the training example, which may slightly reduce the magnitude of the property value (make it less negative).

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**: **-1.65**
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**: The extra **C(C)CCC** is not highly polar, so the property value should be close but slightly less negative due to reduced polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to the hydantoin example with **-1.65** and accounting for the slightly less polar/larger substituent, the predicted value is:

**-1.60**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on structural analogies; the true value may vary slightly depending on additional electronic or steric effects not explicitly accounted for here.)

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9900000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Influence**: The property values appear to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, where more hydrophobic (nonpolar) molecules have higher (less negative) values, and polar/functionalized molecules have lower (more negative) values.
   - Example: **CCCCC** (pentane, very nonpolar) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CCO** (ethanol, polar due to -OH) has **-0.04**.
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., **COc1ccccc1O**, **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**) tend to have negative values.

2. **Halogen Substituents**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** has **0.24** (iodine and chlorine are bulky and hydrophobic).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has **0.18** (multiple chlorines increase hydrophobicity).
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** has **-0.5** (polar -OH dominates over bromine).

3. **Fluorine Substituents**:
   - Fluorine is highly electronegative but small, so its effect on logP is complex. It can increase polarity but also reduce polar surface area. No direct examples with **-CF3** are given, but:
     - **FC(F)(F)** (trifluoromethyl) is moderately hydrophobic but less so than chlorine/iodine due to fluorine's small size.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene (**c1ccccc1**) with no substituents isn't in the examples, but substituted benzenes show that polar groups reduce the property value.
   - **CCc1ccccc1CC** (ethylbenzene) has **-0.78**, suggesting aromaticity alone doesn't dominate.

### Prediction for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**:
- The **-CF3** group is moderately hydrophobic but not as much as **-Cl** or **-I** (see the higher values for chloro/iodo benzenes).
- The benzene ring is nonpolar, but the **-CF3** group introduces some polarity.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (0.24) is more hydrophobic due to iodine.
  - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.5) is more polar due to -OH.
  - **CCc1ccccc1CC** (-0.78) is purely hydrophobic but has larger alkyl groups.

Given this, **-CF3** is likely to result in a value between the polar and nonpolar examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3**  

This balances the slight polarity of **-CF3** with the hydrophobicity of the benzene ring.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.24000000000000002
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: The molecule is a sugar derivative (a hexose sugar like glucose or mannose) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. 
2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (property = **-0.24**): This is a linear sugar alcohol (sorbitol-like structure) with 6 hydroxyl groups. 
   - **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is a cyclic version (pyranose form) of a similar structure, which may slightly alter the property but should remain in a comparable range due to the same functional groups.
3. **Effect of Cyclization**: Cyclization may slightly increase the hydrophilicity (and thus the negative value of the property) compared to the linear form due to constrained geometry and additional intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (-0.24)** but accounting for the cyclic structure, I predict the property for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** to be slightly more negative, likely in the range of:

**-0.30**  

This accounts for the cyclic structure's modest impact on polarity/hydrogen bonding while staying consistent with the trend observed in the dataset.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -1.79
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to identify trends:

### Given Molecule:
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule contains a multi-ring steroid-like structure (similar to some of the provided examples, e.g., `CCC1(=O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` with property **-1.12**).
2. **Ketone groups**: It has two ketone (C=O) groups and an ester (CC(=O)OCC(=O)) fragment.
3. **Hydroxyl groups**: It includes two hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are polar and can lower the property value (as seen in polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` with **-0.24**).
4. **Conjugated double bonds**: The `C=CC1(C)` fragment suggests some conjugation, which may slightly lower the value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The steroid-like structure with ketones and hydroxyl groups is most similar to:
  - `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property **-1.12**).
  - `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (property **-0.63**).
- The additional hydroxyl groups and ester fragment in the given molecule will likely further lower the property value compared to these examples.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the structural complexity, the presence of multiple polar groups (OH, C=O), and the steroid core, the property value is expected to be in the range of **-1.2 to -1.5**. 

Considering the closest analog (`CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` with **-1.12**), the additional polar groups in the given molecule would likely reduce the value further. 

### Final Prediction:
**-1.35** (midway between -1.2 and -1.5, accounting for the additional polar contributions). 

This aligns with the trend that highly functionalized, polar, and conjugated systems in the examples tend to have more negative values.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -0.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**: Molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCC#C`, `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) tend to have moderately negative values (around -0.4 to -0.5).
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`) have more negative values (around -1.3 to -1.6).
3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (`-OH`) and ethers (`-O-`) often contribute to slightly negative values (e.g., `CCCCCC(O)CC` has -0.04, `CCCCOCCO` has -0.08).
   - Carbonyl groups (`C=O`) in non-aromatic systems (e.g., `CCOC(=O)C`) contribute to values around -0.5.
4. **Steroids/Polycyclic Systems**: 
   - The molecule `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (a steroid-like structure with two `-OH` groups) has a value of **-1.02**.
   - The given molecule is also a steroid-like polycyclic system with one `-OH` group and one `C=O` group.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
- **Structure**: It is a tetracyclic steroid-like molecule with:
  - One hydroxyl group (`-OH`).
  - One carbonyl group (`C=O`).
  - Mostly aliphatic (saturated) carbons.
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (value = -1.02), but with one fewer `-OH` group and an additional `C=O`.
  - The `C=O` group may slightly decrease the value (more negative), but the lack of a second `-OH` may offset this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid example with a value of **-1.02**, and accounting for the trade-off between the `C=O` and fewer `-OH` groups, the predicted value is likely slightly more negative. 

**Predicted Property Value: -1.15** (between -1.0 and -1.3, considering the examples). 

This aligns with the trend that polycyclic systems with polar groups (`-OH`, `C=O`) tend to have moderately negative values.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.91
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring with nitro group (-NO2)**: The presence of a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `N(=O)=O`) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which tends to lower the property value. Examples:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` → **-1.38**
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` → **-1.58**
   - `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` → **-1.9**

2. **Amide group (-NHC=O)**: The amide group (`CC(=O)N`) is also electron-withdrawing and polar, contributing to a lower property value. Examples:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` → **-0.73**
   - `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` → **-2.7**

3. **Substitution pattern**: The molecule has a para-substituted aromatic ring with an amide and a nitro group, which are both electron-withdrawing. This combination is likely to have an additive effect on lowering the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy + nitro) → **-1.58**
- `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (amide + nitro + aromatic) → **-2.7**
- `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (amide + aliphatic) → **-0.73**

Given that the nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and the amide adds to this effect, the property value should be more negative than **-1.58** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) but less negative than **-2.7** (more complex nitro-amide). 

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is:  
**-2.1**  

This aligns with the trend where nitro-aromatic compounds with additional electron-withdrawing groups (like amides) tend to have property values in the range of **-2.0 to -2.5**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.3000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is a moderately polar and electron-withdrawing group. Similar phosphoryl or thiophosphoryl groups in the examples are not directly present, but electron-withdrawing groups generally contribute to more negative property values (e.g., sulfonyl or nitro groups in the examples lower the value).
2. **Thioether linkage (SC)**: The sulfur atom in the thioether is less polar than an oxygen ether but still contributes some polarity. In the examples, **CSSC** has a positive value (0.7), but this is a disulfide, not directly comparable.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings are electron-withdrawing. Examples like **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (-1.01) and **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (0.09) show that Cl can lower the value, but multiple Cl atoms or additional features matter.
4. **Lactam (c(=O)oc)**: This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group. Similar carbonyl-containing structures (e.g., **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, -1.7) suggest significant negative contributions.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as other groups. Examples like **CCCO** (-0.04) or **CCO** (not in the list but similar to **CCCO**) suggest minor contributions.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule combines multiple polar/electron-withdrawing features (P(=S), Cl, lactam) and aromatic systems. 
- **COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3** (-3.15) has two carbonyls and aromatic systems, giving a very negative value.
- **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (-2.4) has a thiophene, carbonyl, and aromatic rings.
- **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (-1.01) is simpler but has a Cl and two fused rings.

Given the combination of P(=S), Cl, lactam, and aromaticity, the property value is likely more negative than simpler chlorinated aromatics but less extreme than molecules with multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro or multiple carbonyls).

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-1.8** to **-2.2**. Given the examples, I would predict:  
**-2.0** (close to **-2.01** for a molecule with similar complexity and polar groups). 

### Final Answer:
**-2.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobicity. The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a branched alcohol (tert-butanol derivative) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a highly hydrophobic tert-butyl group.

From the examples:
- Simple alcohols like **CC(C)CO** (isopropanol) and **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol analog) have a property value of **-0.04** (e.g., **CC(C)CO** and **CCCCCCC(C)O**). 
- The presence of the hydroxyl group seems to balance the hydrophobic bulk, leading to this consistent value.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:  
**-0.04**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -1.6500000000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **purine-like heterocycle** with the following features:
1. **Core structure**: A fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (imidazole and pyrimidine-like).
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1.
   - Two NH groups (imino groups) at positions 1 and 7 (or equivalent positions in the fused system).
   - Multiple nitrogen atoms in the aromatic system, contributing to polarity and hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
From the examples, molecules with:
- **Multiple nitrogen heterocycles** (e.g., `c2cccc3sc1nncn1c23`, property = -1.42) tend to have negative values.
- **Carbonyl + NH groups** (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`, property = -1.39) also have negative values.
- **Fused aromatic systems** with polar groups (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45`, property = -2.6) show more negative values due to increased conjugation and polarity.

This molecule is **more polar** than simple aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccccc1SC`, property = -0.43) but **less polar** than highly conjugated systems with multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., `CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`, property = -3.7).

### Predicted Property:
Given its similarity to nitrogen-rich heterocycles with carbonyl groups, the property value is likely in the range of **-1.4 to -1.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.65**  

This aligns with the trends observed for similar structures in the provided examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester with the following features:
1. **Small alkyl group (isopropyl)**: The `CC(C)` part is a branched 3-carbon chain (isopropyl group).
2. **Ester functional group (`OC=O`)**: This is a formate ester (specifically, isopropyl formate).

### Comparison to Given Examples:
1. **Simple alcohols and ethers** (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O`, `CCCOC(C)C`, `CC(C)O`) have property values around **-0.04**. These are neutral, small, and non-aromatic.
2. **Esters** (e.g., `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` with a value of **0.11**) tend to have slightly higher values than simple alcohols/ethers due to the polar carbonyl group.
3. **Formates (HCOOR)** are simpler esters, and their property values are likely similar or slightly lower than bulkier esters.

### Key Observations:
- The isopropyl group (`CC(C)`) is not highly polar or bulky, so it won't significantly lower the value.
- The formate ester (`OC=O`) introduces polarity but is smaller than other esters in the examples (e.g., phosphates or larger carboxylates).

### Predicted Property:
Given the examples, small esters tend to have values slightly above simple alcohols/ethers (which are around -0.04). For **CC(C)OC=O**, a reasonable estimate would be close to **0.0**, but likely slightly higher due to the ester group's polarity. 

However, looking at `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (a phosphate ester) with a value of **0.11**, a simpler formate ester like this might be slightly lower. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**0.05** (a small positive value, reflecting the ester's polarity but limited size/branching). 

However, since the examples show small esters like `CCOC=C` (an ether/alkene hybrid) at **-0.46** and `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...` (a steroid ester) at **-1.12**, the value for this small ester is likely closer to **0.0**. 

Given the data, the most consistent estimate is:  
**-0.04** (similar to small alcohols/ethers, as the ester's polarity and small size balance out). 

But to align better with the phosphate ester example (0.11), a slight positive value is more accurate.  

Final prediction: **0.05**. 

However, since the examples don't include simple formates, and the closest neutral small molecules are around **-0.04**, I'll refine to:  
**0.0** (neutral, balancing ester polarity and small size). 

But reviewing again, `CC(=O)O...` (acetyl group) in steroids gives negative values, so perhaps this is slightly negative.  

Given uncertainty, the safest estimate is:  
**-0.04** (same as small alcohols/ethers, as the ester's effect is modest). 

### Final Answer:  
**-0.04**

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -2.2899999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea moiety (**N-C(=O)-N**). 
   - Urea-like structures in the examples (e.g., **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**, property = -1.26) tend to have negative property values.
   - The presence of two aromatic rings (like in **Nc1ccccc1**) is also seen in other molecules with negative values (e.g., **Cc1cccc2ccccc12**, property = -1.3).

2. **Aromatic Rings**: The two phenyl rings are electron-rich and may contribute to a more negative property value, similar to other aromatic systems in the examples (e.g., **c1ccncc1**, property = -0.85; **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**, property = -1.38).

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: The urea group is highly polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which often correlates with more negative property values (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C**, property = -1.39).

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (property = -1.51): This has a carbamate group and aromatic rings, similar in polarity to urea.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -1.26): This is a cyclic urea, structurally simpler but with a similar core.
   - The presence of two phenyl rings (instead of alkyl groups) likely makes the property more negative due to increased conjugation and polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the urea core and two aromatic rings, the property value is expected to be more negative than simpler ureas but comparable to other polar aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -1.45**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar structures in the examples (e.g., -1.26 to -1.51 for urea/amide-like systems with aromatic rings).

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -1.5599999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) tend to have more negative property values. For example:
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **-2.34**.
     - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two linked benzene rings) has a value of **-1.96**.
   - Simpler aromatic systems like `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene) or `Brc1ccccc1` (bromobenzene) have less negative values (**-0.43** and **-0.3**, respectively).

2. **Fused Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring. This is a moderately sized polycyclic aromatic system, similar in complexity to some of the examples above.

3. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger polycyclic system) has **-2.34**.
   - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two linked benzene rings) has **-1.96**.
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (fluorene) is smaller than the first example but larger than the second, so its value should lie between these two.

4. **Other Factors**:
   - No heteroatoms (N, O, S) or polar functional groups are present in `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`, which would otherwise influence the property value further. The property seems primarily influenced by aromaticity and size.

### Prediction:
Given the above analysis, the property value for **fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** should be close to **-2.0**, as it is a fused polycyclic aromatic system but not as large as some of the more extreme examples. 

Looking at similar-sized systems:
- `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two linked benzene rings): **-1.96**.
- `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (larger polycyclic): **-2.34**.

Fluorene is intermediate in size, so a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -2.1** (slightly more negative than the linked benzene rings due to the fused ring system). 

However, since the given examples round to two decimal places, and to align with the trend, I would predict:

**Final answer: -2.15** (but if forced to match the format of the examples, **-2.1** or **-2.2** would be reasonable). 

Given the options, **-2.15** is a precise estimate, but if we must choose from the examples' granularity, **-2.1** is the closest. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the value for `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is **-1.96**, and fluorene is slightly more conjugated/fused, so **-2.1** is justified. 

But to match the precision of the examples (which are all to two decimal places), I'll round to **-2.10**.

**Final predicted property value: -2.10**

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.7599999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Sulfonamide (NS(=O)(=O))**: This group is polar and often contributes to negative property values (e.g., see molecules with sulfonamides or similar polar groups in the examples).
   - **Guanidine-like (NC(=N)N)**: This is a highly polar and basic group, which typically lowers the property value.
   - **Aromatic ring with an amine (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Electron-donating groups like amines on aromatic rings tend to reduce the property value.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides or polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, property = -1.7) tend to have negative values.
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**, property = -1.64) also show negative values.
   - The presence of **two nitrogens in the guanidine-like group** and the **sulfonamide** suggests strong polarity, similar to some of the more negative examples.

3. **Estimated Property**:
   - Given the high polarity and resemblance to other molecules with sulfonamides and multiple nitrogens, the property value is likely in the range of **-1.5 to -2.0**.
   - A reasonable estimate is **-1.7**, as this aligns with similarly polar and functionalized molecules in the dataset.

### Final Prediction:

Iteration: 25
SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -2.650000000000001
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electron-withdrawing or electron-donating effects. The molecule in question is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: These are strong electron-withdrawing groups and are present in several molecules in the dataset with negative property values (e.g., -1.58, -2.73).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: Another strong electron-withdrawing group, which further increases the negative contribution.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: A moderately electron-donating group, but its effect is likely outweighed by the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.
4. **Aromatic ring with substitutions**: The presence of multiple substituents on the aromatic ring increases molecular polarity and complexity.

### Comparison to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O**: This has two nitro groups and a complex structure, with a property value of **-2.73**.
- **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: This has one nitro group and a phenol, with a property value of **-1.58**.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: This has amide and carbamate groups, with a property value of **-2.24**.

The molecule in question has **two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group**, which are even more electron-withdrawing than the examples above. Thus, its property value should be more negative than -2.24 but slightly less negative than -2.73 (since the latter has additional heterocyclic complexity).

### Predicted property value:
**-2.5** (a value between -2.24 and -2.73, reflecting the strong electron-withdrawing effects but slightly less complex than the -2.73 example). 

However, looking more closely, the molecule is very similar in electron-withdrawing character to **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (-2.73)**, but with slightly less cyclic complexity. Thus, a slight adjustment gives:

**Final predicted property value: -2.6** (accounting for the two nitro groups and trifluoromethyl group dominating the effect). 

But to align more closely with the trend, I'll refine to **-2.55**. 

Given the dataset, the most precise estimate is:  
**-2.5** (rounded for consistency with the provided examples). 

However, the closest analog is the -2.73 molecule, so a value near that is reasonable. 

**Final answer: -2.6** (matching the trend for highly electron-withdrawing, multi-nitro systems).

   - **Ester (COO)**: The molecule has the structure **CC(C)OC=O**, which is an ester (specifically, an acetate derivative with a branched alkyl group). 
   - **Branching**: The presence of **CC(C)** indicates a branched alkyl group (isopropyl-like).

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide): Property = -0.53
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (branched ester): Property = -0.53
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (ester): Property = -0.53
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ester): Property = -0.53 (not explicitly listed, but similar to other esters).

   Esters and amides with small/branched alkyl groups tend to cluster around **-0.53** in the given data.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is small and polar due to the ester group, similar to other small esters/amides in the dataset.
   - Branching (isopropyl) does not significantly deviate the property from linear esters (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)C** is also -0.53).

### Prediction:
Given the consistency of esters/amides with small/branched alkyl groups having a property value of **-0.53**, the predicted property for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**-0.53**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.9800000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with the following features:
1. A benzene ring with:
   - Two methyl groups (`Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`), one at position 1 and one at position 3.
   - A hydroxyl group (`O`) at position 4 (para to the first methyl).
2. The presence of an aromatic ring with polar (OH) and nonpolar (CH₃) substituents.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
From the provided data, we can observe trends for similar structures:
1. **Phenol derivatives** (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has a value of **-0.98**).
2. **Methyl-substituted aromatics** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C` has a value of **-0.78**).
3. **Hydroxyl-substituted aromatics** (e.g., `Oc1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` has a value of **-2.89**, but this is highly polar due to multiple OH groups).

For **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The hydroxyl group introduces polarity (negative contribution).
- The methyl groups are weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic (slightly positive or neutral contribution).
- The molecule is less polar than polyhydroxy benzenes but more polar than plain toluene or xylene.

### Closest Matches:
1. `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **-0.98**
2. `Cc1ccccc1C` (p-xylene): **-0.78**
3. `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (toluene derivative): **-0.98**

Given that our molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol**, it is more polar than xylene but less polar than polyhydroxy benzenes. The hydroxyl group's effect is partially offset by the methyl groups.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is between **-0.98** (phenol) and **-0.78** (xylene). Splitting the difference, we predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.88**  

(Note: If forced to pick from the given examples, **-0.98** is the closest match due to the dominant effect of the OH group.)  

However, since the methyl groups slightly reduce polarity compared to plain phenol, a value closer to **-0.90** is also plausible. Given the examples, **-0.98** is the most defensible choice.  

**Final answer: -0.98**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.06000000000000011
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**:
   - Molecules with **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragments tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.65, 0.39, 0.9, 0.46).
   - This suggests that the **P=S group contributes positively** to the property.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing or Donating Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with **electron-donating groups (e.g., -OCH3, -CH3)** or **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -Cl, -Br)** influence the property.
   - For example, **Cl/Br substituents** on aromatic rings in phosphorothioates increase the property value (e.g., 0.65 for Br, 0.9 for I).

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The presence of **-SC** (thioether) in the aromatic ring is a new feature not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (like -S(=O)) in other molecules tend to have **moderate effects** (e.g., -1.07 for sulfonamide).

4. **Methyl (-CH3) Group**:
   - Methyl groups on aromatic rings (e.g., **c(C)c1**) are common and typically have a **neutral to slightly negative effect** unless paired with strongly electron-donating/withdrawing groups.

### Analysis of **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:
- The molecule has:
   - A **phosphorothioate (P=S) group** (strong positive contribution, likely ~0.4 to 0.9 based on examples).
   - A **thioether (-SC)** substituent on the aromatic ring (unknown exact effect, but sulfur may slightly reduce the positive contribution).
   - A **methyl (-CH3)** group (neutral/slight negative effect).
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl/Br), which would otherwise increase the value further.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: 0.65 (Cl/Br increase value).
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 0.46 (less than Br/I but still positive).
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**: 0.9 (I increases value more than Br/Cl).

Since the new molecule lacks halogens but has a thioether (-SC), the value will likely be **lower than the halogenated examples but still positive**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is approximately:  
**0.35** (slightly lower than the 0.46 for the trichlorinated analog due to the absence of halogens and the presence of the thioether).

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.11000000000000015
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** tend to have **positive property values**, especially when the chlorination is symmetric or extensive. For example:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: 0.18  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 0.18  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 0.47  
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**: 1.74  

2. The molecule in question is **perchlorinated and symmetric**, similar to the examples above but with even more chlorines (7 Cl atoms). 

3. The property value increases with the number of chlorines and symmetry:
   - 5 Cl atoms: 0.18  
   - 6 Cl atoms: 0.47  
   - 6 Cl atoms (aliphatic): 1.74  

### Prediction:
Given the **7 chlorines** and **high symmetry**, the property value should be **higher than 0.47** but likely less than the fully aliphatic **1.74**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

This aligns with the trend of increasing values for heavily chlorinated aromatic systems.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes**: 
   - **CCC (propane)**: 0.0
   - **CC (ethane)**: 0.0
   - **CCCCCCCCC (nonane)**: 0.0  
   These suggest that pure hydrocarbons (no functional groups) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

2. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): -2.58  
     This shows that nitro groups strongly decrease the property value, especially when multiple are present.
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: -2.39  
     Another example with two nitro groups, reinforcing the trend.

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The given molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** is a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane). While no direct example of a simple nitroalkane is provided, we can infer from the nitro group's effect that it will decrease the property value compared to propane (CCC: 0.0).

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Carbonyl (C=O), halogens, and other polar groups also decrease the property value, but nitro groups seem particularly impactful.

### Prediction for CCCN(=O)=O:
- The nitro group (**NO2**) is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, which likely contributes to a significant reduction in the property value.
- Comparing to propane (CCC: 0.0), adding **NO2** should decrease the value. Given that trinitrobenzene is -2.58, a single nitro group on a small alkane like propane would likely have a smaller but still notable effect.
- From the examples, **Nc1ccccc1O** (nitrophenol) is -1.18, and **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** is -0.69. A simple nitroalkane might fall in a similar range.

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.8 to -1.2**.  

A precise prediction based on the examples would be:  
**-1.0**.  

### Final Answer:
**-1.0**

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.3700000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.01  
     (Chlorine and bromine substitution on benzene ring)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = -0.4  
     (Multiple chlorine substitutions)
   - **BrC(Br)Br**: Property = 1.44  
     (Highly brominated aliphatic compound, outlier due to non-aromatic structure)
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = -0.69  
     (Chlorine + methoxy substitution)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: Property = -0.69  
     (Same as above, positional isomer)
   - **Fc1ccc(F)cc1** (not explicitly given, but similar to Cl analogs): Expected slightly more negative than Cl due to fluorine's higher electronegativity.

2. **Mono-Substituted vs. Di-Substituted**:
   - Mono-substituted halobenzenes (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**) are not in the examples, but di-substituted halobenzenes like **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** have a property close to zero (-0.01).
   - Adding electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2) makes the property more negative (e.g., **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -1.38).

3. **Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine or bromine, so **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would likely have a slightly more negative property than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.01) due to stronger electron withdrawal.

4. **Position of Substitution**:
   - The property doesn't seem highly sensitive to positional isomerism for halogens (e.g., **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** and **COc1ccccc1Cl** both have -0.69).

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- This is a benzene ring with fluorine (strong electron-withdrawing) and bromine (moderate electron-withdrawing) substitutions.
- Compared to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.01), fluorine will pull more electron density, making the property slightly more negative.
- No other functional groups are present to further lower the value (e.g., NO2 or carbonyls would push it more negative).

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Property = -0.15**  

This is slightly more negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.01) due to fluorine's stronger electron-withdrawing effect, but not as negative as molecules with nitro or carbonyl groups.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary alcohol (C-OH)** and **alkyl (C-C) groups**.
   - It has a **bicyclic structure** with two fused rings (a cyclohexane and a cyclopentane).

2. **Polarity and Hydrophobicity**:
   - The presence of the **hydroxyl group (-OH)** introduces some polarity, but the majority of the structure is hydrophobic (alkyl groups and fused rings).
   - The bicyclic structure may reduce overall polarity compared to simpler alcohols.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **tertiary alcohols** and **alkyl groups** (e.g., `CC(C)(C)CO`, `CCCC(C)(C)O`, `CC1CCCO1`) have property values around **-0.04**.
   - More polar or complex structures (e.g., fused rings with additional polar groups) tend to have lower (more negative) values (e.g., `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO` has -1.41).
   - This molecule is less polar than the highly functionalized examples but more complex than simple alcohols.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The hydroxyl group is the primary polar feature, but the bulky bicyclic alkyl structure dominates, suggesting a value closer to simple tertiary alcohols.
   - No strongly polar or ionizable groups (e.g., acids, amines) are present to push the value lower.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to `CC(C)(C)CO` and `CCCC(C)(C)O` (both with **-0.04**), but with slightly more complexity due to the bicyclic structure, the predicted value is likely in the same range. The bicyclic nature might slightly lower the value, but not significantly.

**Predicted Property Value: -0.04** (same as simpler tertiary alcohols with bulky alkyl groups). 

### Justification:
- The hydroxyl group is balanced by the hydrophobic bicyclic structure.
- No additional polar or charged groups are present to further reduce the value.
- The examples suggest that such structures typically fall around **-0.04**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is **-0.04**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -1.07
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can analyze the structural features and their corresponding property values to predict the property for the new molecule: 

**Molecule to predict:**  
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule contains a **thiophosphate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)OCC`), which is also present in one of the examples:  
   `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a property value of **-0.43**.  
   The only difference is the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a succinimide-like group).

2. The **aromatic system** (`c1ccccc1`) is common in many examples and typically contributes to negative property values (e.g., `-1.27` for `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2`).

3. The **succinimide-like moiety** (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) is somewhat similar to structures like `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2` (property = **-1.39**) or `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C` (property = **-1.65**), but with an aromatic ring fused.

### Comparison with Closest Example:
The closest example is:  
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = **-0.43**).  

The new molecule replaces `SC(CCl)` with a **more polar and conjugated** `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` group. This substitution is likely to **decrease the property value further** (more negative) due to increased electron delocalization and polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to the example with **-0.43** but with a more electron-withdrawing group, the predicted property would be slightly more negative.  

**Predicted value: ~ -0.50**  

(Note: Without additional data or a clear trend for such specific substitutions, this is an approximate estimate based on the closest structural analog.)  

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is approximately **-0.50**.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -1.7699999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **quinoxaline-like** core with a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and **two nitrogen atoms** in a fused ring system. This is similar to some of the more negative property values in the examples (e.g., heterocycles with conjugated systems and polar groups).
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = -2.42) has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and nitrogen, yielding a highly negative value.
   - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -1.39) has a similar diketopiperazine-like core with carbonyls and nitrogens.

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has **two methyl groups (C)** and a **fused benzene ring (c2ccccc2)**, which add hydrophobicity but are offset by the polar carbonyl and nitrogens.

3. **Conjugation**: The system is highly conjugated (aromatic rings + carbonyl), which typically correlates with more negative property values in the examples.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (-2.42): Very similar fused aromatic system with carbonyl and nitrogens.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (-1.39): Less aromatic but similar polar core.
- **CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3** (-2.87): Highly polar and conjugated.

Given that **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is less polar than the -2.87 example but more polar than the -1.39 example, and very similar to the -2.42 example, a reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than -2.42 due to the absence of a second carbonyl.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-2.30** (This balances the influence of the carbonyl and nitrogens with the slightly reduced polarity compared to the -2.42 example.)

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to identify trends:

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate), with the structure:
- A linear 6-carbon chain (**CCCCCC**) with an ester group (**(=O)OCC**).
- The ester group consists of a carbonyl (**C=O**) and an ethoxy (**OCC**) moiety.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Polarity**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a value of **0.0** (nonpolar, hydrophobic).
   - Longer carbon chains with polar groups tend to have values shifted negatively (more hydrophilic or polar).
   - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N** with **-0.73**, **CC(=O)OC...** with **-0.53**) typically have moderately negative values.

2. **Ester-Containing Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)N**: **-0.73**
   - **CC(=O)OC...**: **-0.53**
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: **-0.53** (nonyl acetate, similar long chain + ester).

3. **Hexanoic Acid Ethyl Ester**:
   - The 6-carbon chain is longer than pentane but shorter than nonyl acetate.
   - The ester group introduces polarity, but the long alkyl chain reduces it compared to smaller esters.

### Prediction:
Given the examples:
- Nonyl acetate (**CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**) has **-0.53**.
- Smaller esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**) have **-0.73**.
- The hexanoic acid ethyl ester is intermediate in chain length, so its value should be between these two.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is:  
**-0.53** (similar to nonyl acetate, as the chain length dominates the polarity effect). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.53**

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.31
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the patterns observed, the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) can be compared to similar structures:

1. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-1.31**.
2. **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) has a value of **-1.51**.
3. **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (a more complex ester) has a value of **-1.84**.

The presence of the **ester group (COO-R)** and the **phenyl ring** tends to give values in the range of **-1.3 to -1.5** for simple aromatic esters. Since **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is structurally very similar to **ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, -1.31)**, but with a slightly shorter alkyl chain (methyl instead of ethyl), the difference in the property value should be minimal. 

### Predicted Property Value: **-1.32** (very close to ethyl benzoate). 

This aligns well with the observed trend where small aromatic esters typically fall in this range.

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.52
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with no functional groups or halogens**:
   - **CCCC** (butane-like structures) tend to have values close to **0.0** (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CC` = 0.0, `C1CCCC1` = 0.0).
   - **Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes/alkynes)**:
     - `CC/C=C/C` (2-pentene) = **-0.26**
     - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene) = **-1.04** (the aromatic ring lowers the value further).
   - **Conjugated systems** (like 1,3-butadiene) may have slightly lower values due to increased polarity/polarizability compared to isolated double bonds.

2. **Trend for simple alkenes**:
   - A single double bond (`C=C`) reduces the value slightly (e.g., `CC/C=C/C` = -0.26).
   - Conjugation (alternating double bonds) further lowers the value due to enhanced electron delocalization.

### Prediction for **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene):
- It has two conjugated double bonds, which should give a slightly lower value than a single double bond (like `CC/C=C/C` = -0.26).
- However, it lacks aromaticity or other functional groups, so the reduction is modest.
- A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the examples and trends, the predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is:  
**-0.45** (approximately midway between -0.26 and -0.6). 

This aligns with the observed behavior of conjugated systems in the dataset.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.44
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a halogenated alkane with F, Cl, and Br) has a property value of **0.56**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a heavily chlorinated aromatic) has a value of **0.47**.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (a chlorinated aromatic) has a value of **-1.01**.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (a brominated aromatic) has a value of **-0.82**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **-0.11**.

   Halogenated aliphatic compounds (like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br) tend to have **positive values**, while halogenated aromatics tend to have **negative values**.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated**:
   - Bromine appears to contribute less to positive values compared to fluorine (e.g., FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a higher value than brominated aromatics).
   - The presence of multiple halogens (especially Br or Cl) in aliphatic systems increases the property value.

3. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a fully brominated aliphatic compound (similar to chloroform but with Br instead of Cl).
   - Compared to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (0.56)**, replacing F with Br would likely **reduce the property value** because fluorine is more electronegative and polarizable.
   - However, it is still a fully halogenated aliphatic compound, so we expect a **positive but lower value than 0.56**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **BrC(Br)Br** is expected to have a **positive property value**, but lower than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (0.56)**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.32**  

This aligns with the idea that brominated aliphatics are less polarizable/electronegative than fluorinated ones but still exhibit positive contributions due to the high halogen content.

To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate-like group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a thiophosphate group (P=S with ethoxy substituents). From the examples, similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have property values around **-0.1**. Thiophosphate groups are moderately polar but not extremely hydrophilic or hydrophobic.
2. **Thioether linkage (SC(CCl))**: The presence of a sulfur atom bonded to a chlorinated carbon (CCl) suggests moderate polarity. Chlorine substituents (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) have values around **0.38**, but when combined with other polar groups, the overall effect may be less pronounced.
3. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure (cyclic amide fused to a benzene ring). Similar structures (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**) have values around **-1.88**. Cyclic amides are polar and can significantly lower the property value.
4. **Ethoxy groups (CCO)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as highly hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyls or carboxylates).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines a thiophosphate group (~-0.1), a chlorinated thioether (~0.3), and a phthalimide-like lactam (~-1.88). The net effect is likely dominated by the lactam's polarity, but the thiophosphate and thioether may partially offset this.
- A similar molecule in the examples, **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, has a value of **-0.1**, but it lacks the highly polar lactam. Another similar molecule, **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**, has a value of **-1.88** but lacks the thiophosphate.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the polar lactam and the moderately polar thiophosphate/thioether, the property value is likely intermediate. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.1**  

This balances the strong polarity of the lactam with the weaker contributions from the other groups.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -2.28
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Amide (**C(=O)N**), which is highly polar and often contributes to negative property values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)C** has -0.53, **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** has -0.73).
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic ring (**c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)**), which adds polarity (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has -1.09).
   - Heterocyclic group (**n2nc(oc2=O)**) with a polar carbonyl, similar to other heterocycles in the examples (e.g., **Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2** has -1.72).
   - Bulky tert-butyl group (**C(C)(C)C**), which is non-polar but doesn't dominate over the polar groups.

2. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - The amide + chloroaromatic + heterocycle combination is reminiscent of **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-1.09) and **Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-1.58), but with additional polar groups.
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (amide, chloro, heterocycle) suggests a more negative value than simpler amides or chloroaromatics.

3. **Trends**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or multiple polar groups tend to have more negative values (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has -1.98).
   - This molecule lacks nitro groups but has similarly polar features.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combined polarity of the amide, chloroaromatic, and heterocyclic carbonyl, the value is likely more negative than -1.5 but less extreme than -2.0. A reasonable estimate is:

**-1.85**  

This aligns with the trends observed for similarly polar and complex structures in the examples.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -1.0899999999999994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two phenol groups (`Oc1ccccc1`), each substituted with chlorine (`Cl`).
   - The molecule is a **dichlorinated diphenyl ether** (specifically, a dichlorinated derivative of diphenyl ether with additional Cl substitutions).

2. **Polarity and Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - Phenol groups (`-OH`) are polar and can donate electrons through resonance, but they are also weakly acidic.
   - Chlorine (`-Cl`) is electron-withdrawing inductively but electron-donating through resonance (less so than `-OH`).
   - The presence of multiple Cl atoms and the ether linkage (`O` between rings) adds to the electron-withdrawing character.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = -0.4): This is a dichlorophenol. Adding another phenol ring with Cl substitutions would likely make the property more negative due to increased electron-withdrawing effects and larger size.
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (property = -0.98): This is a dichlorinated biphenyl. Our molecule is similar but has phenol groups instead of plain phenyl rings, which would make it more polar and likely more negative.
   - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property = -1.31): A phenol with an aldehyde (strongly electron-withdrawing). Our molecule has Cl instead of aldehyde, but two phenol rings and three Cl atoms, which could approach a similar effect.

4. **Expected Property**:
   - The molecule is more polar and electron-withdrawing than simple chlorinated phenols but less so than nitro or aldehyde-substituted aromatics (which often have properties < -1.5).
   - The presence of three Cl atoms and two phenol groups suggests a property between **-1.0 and -1.5**.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the most plausible property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:  
**-1.28**  

This is based on:
- Similarity to dichlorophenol (-0.4) but more negative due to additional Cl and phenol.
- Comparison to dichlorobiphenyl (-0.98) but more negative due to phenol groups.
- Not as extreme as nitro/aldehyde-substituted aromatics (< -1.5).  

Thus, **-1.28** is a balanced estimate.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.26
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule `CC/C=C\C` (which is equivalent to `CC=CC` or 2-butene) is structurally similar to `CC/C=C/C` (also a butene isomer), which has a property value of **-0.26**. 

Since the double bond configuration (cis/trans) does not appear to significantly alter the property value in the given examples (e.g., similar values for small aliphatic chains with minor variations), the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is likely very close to that of `CC/C=C/C`. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.26**

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Ethers**: 
   - **C** (methane): 0.0
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.04
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): -0.04
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.53
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate): -0.53 (not explicitly listed, but similar to isopropyl acetate)
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 0.0

   Simple alkanes and ethers tend to have property values close to 0 or slightly negative (e.g., -0.04 for alcohols or ethers with no strong polar or functional group effects).

2. **Ethers**: 
   - The only ether in the examples is **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate), which has a value of -0.53, but this is an ester, not a pure ether. 
   - Pure ethers (like **CCCOCC**) are likely to have values closer to simple alkanes or alcohols (e.g., -0.04).

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) increase the property value (more positive).
   - Polar groups (OH, C=O, N) decrease the property value (more negative).
   - **CCCOCC** has no halogens or strongly polar groups, just an ether linkage (-O-), which is weakly polar.

4. **Size and Branching**:
   - Larger or more branched molecules don't necessarily trend strongly in the examples unless functional groups are involved.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- **CCCOCC** is diethyl ether, a simple symmetrical ether with no halogens or strongly polar groups. 
- It is analogous to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, -0.04) or **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, -0.04) in terms of polarity and lack of strong functional groups. 
- The ether oxygen is less polar than an alcohol OH, so the value might be slightly less negative than -0.04, but the examples suggest simple ethers/alcohols hover around -0.04.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-0.04**. 

This aligns with the trend for simple, weakly polar molecules in the given data.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -2.289999999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, I can predict its property value by analyzing similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide group (N(C=O))**, which is also seen in molecules like **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = -2.4) and **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property = -0.73).
   - It has **two aromatic rings (phenyl groups)**, similar to **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -1.56) and **Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (property = -2.34).
   - The **bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)** attached to the amide nitrogen is somewhat analogous to the steric hindrance in **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (property = -0.04), though this is less relevant.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a more complex heterocyclic system and a higher property value (-2.4).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** has a less conjugated system and a higher (less negative) value (-0.73).
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (no amide but two phenyl groups) has a value of -1.56.
   - The presence of the **amide group** and **two phenyl rings** suggests a value more negative than -1.56 but less negative than -2.4.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule is most similar to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** but lacks the highly polarizable thiophene and oxazole moieties, so its value should be less negative.
   - Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **-1.8 to -2.0**.

**Final Predicted Property Value: -1.85**  

This aligns with the trend where highly conjugated, polar, and aromatic systems (especially with amides) tend to have more negative values.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.8300000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) attached. This is similar to **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** (property: -1.39) and **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -2.29), which also contain amide groups attached to aromatic rings.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - The **Br** substituent is present in **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (property: -0.37) and **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -0.5). 
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is electron-withdrawing, similar to other amide/carbonyl-containing molecules in the dataset (e.g., **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**, property: -3.15).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property of **-0.5** (phenol + Br substituent).
- **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a property of **-2.29** (bulky amide + two aromatic rings).
- **Clc1ccccc1** (simpler halogenated aromatic) has a property of **-0.49**.

The acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but more so than a simple halogen. The **Br** substituent is moderately electron-withdrawing. Combining these effects, the property value should be more negative than **-0.5** (from **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**) but less negative than **-2.29** (from the bulky amide example).

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **-1.2**, considering the balance between the electron-withdrawing effects of the amide and Br groups.

**Final Answer: -1.2**

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.78
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule consists of an isobutyl group (**CC(C)C**) attached to a benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**).
   - This is similar to **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene, property = -0.98) and **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (property = -0.78), where alkyl groups are attached to a benzene ring.

2. **Trends in the Data**:
   - Adding alkyl groups to benzene tends to decrease the property value (make it more negative) compared to unsubstituted benzene, but the effect diminishes with longer/branched chains.
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (methylbenzene): -0.98  
     **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl + methylbenzene): -0.78  
     **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl + methylbenzene): -0.78  
     **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene) should be slightly less negative than toluene due to the longer/branched chain.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The isobutyl group is bulkier than a methyl or ethyl group, which may slightly reduce the impact on the property value compared to toluene.
   - A reasonable estimate is between **-0.70 and -0.80**, closer to the values for ethyl- and isopropyl-substituted benzenes in the dataset.

**Final predicted property value: -0.78**  

*(This matches the trend observed for similar alkyl-substituted benzenes in the provided examples.)*

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -1.11
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -1.51
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): -0.98
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): -1.98
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (amide + chloro): -1.22
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -1.58

   These examples suggest that aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, halogens) tend to have more negative property values, while electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy) are less negative.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (carbonyl in heterocycle): -0.77
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (cyclic ketone): -0.85
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide): -1.51
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): -2.62

   Carbonyl groups (especially conjugated with aromatic rings) contribute to more negative property values.

3. **Benzaldehyde-like Structures**:
   - The closest example is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, -1.51), but benzaldehyde lacks the additional phenol or amide group.
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene, -0.98) is less negative because the methoxy group is electron-donating, whereas the aldehyde group in benzaldehyde is electron-withdrawing.

### Prediction for **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde):
- The aldehyde group (**O=C**) is electron-withdrawing and conjugated with the benzene ring, similar to the amide in **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-1.51) but without the additional phenol group. Thus, the property value should be less negative than -1.51 but more negative than **COc1ccccc1** (-0.98).
- Another comparable example is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-1.22), where the amide is conjugated with the ring but has additional substituents.

Given these comparisons, the property value for benzaldehyde is likely in the range of **-1.1 to -1.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.15**

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.71
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two **amide groups** (`O=C2CN...C(=O)N2`), which are polar and can contribute to negative property values (as seen in other amide-containing molecules).
   - A **nitro group** (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, often associated with negative property values (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has -1.78).
   - A **fused heterocyclic system** (imidazole-like ring from `O=C2CN...N2`), which can enhance polarity and negative values (similar to `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` with -1.38).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups and polar heterocycles (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` at -1.78, `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` at -1.38) tend to have strongly negative values.
   - The presence of two amide groups and a nitro group suggests even higher polarity, likely pushing the value further negative than single-polar-group examples.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule resembles `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = -2.29), which has two amide-like groups and aromatic rings. Our molecule has additional nitro-group polarity, so a similar or more negative value is expected.
   - The nitro-aromatic fragment is also seen in `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (-1.78), but our molecule lacks chloro substituents (which slightly reduce polarity) and has more polar amides.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of:
- Two amide groups,
- A nitro group,
- A fused polar heterocycle,

the property value is likely in the range of **-2.0 to -2.5**. A reasonable estimate is **-2.3**, balancing the contributions of the nitro group and the amide/heterocycle system.

**-2.3**

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1.9599999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic systems with nitrogen** tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1` has -0.98, `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` has -1.89).
2. **Extended conjugation** (e.g., polyaromatic systems) further decreases the property value (e.g., `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3` has -2.34).
3. **Nitrogen substituents** like `N(=O)=O` or `N=N` lower the value (e.g., `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has -1.96).
4. The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single N-N bond instead of a double N=N bond. The single bond is less electron-withdrawing, so the property value should be slightly less negative.

### Comparison:
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -1.96  
- **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: The absence of the double bond should make the value less negative, but still significantly negative due to the aromatic nitrogens.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but with reduced electron withdrawal, a reasonable estimate is **-1.75**.

### Final Answer:
**-1.75**

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1.3900000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **C1CCCC1**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to the amide nitrogens.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically lowers the property value (more negative). 
   - The cyclic structure adds rigidity but doesn't significantly increase hydrophobicity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -1.39): This is a similar cyclic diamide with additional alkyl chains. The simpler structure of the target molecule (no extra alkyl groups) suggests a slightly less negative value.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not in the list, but simpler imides like succinimide derivatives tend to have values around -1.0 to -1.5).
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -1.26): This is a cyclic urea (similar hydrogen-bonding capacity) with alkyl substitutions. The target molecule lacks alkyl substitutions but has a similar cyclic diamide core.

4. **Size and Flexibility**: 
   - The molecule is small and rigid, which reduces the entropic penalty for solvation (less negative than larger flexible molecules).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong hydrogen-bonding capacity (two amides) but small size and lack of extended hydrophobic groups, the property value is likely in the range of **-1.2 to -1.4**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.3**  

This aligns with similar cyclic diamides/ureas in the examples (e.g., -1.26 for the cyclic urea derivative and -1.39 for the more substituted imide). The cyclopentane ring doesn't add significant hydrophobicity, so the value is slightly more negative than simple amides but less negative than larger or more polar molecules.

**-1.3**

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6900000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Symmetry and Substitution**: The molecule is a biphenyl system (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with **three chlorine atoms** attached (two on one ring and one on the other). This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure**.
2. **Polarity**: The chlorine atoms introduce moderate polarity but are balanced by the symmetric, hydrophobic biphenyl core.
3. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.2**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a more heavily chlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.11**.
   - The current molecule is less chlorinated than the latter but more than the former, suggesting a value between **-0.2 and -0.11**.

### Key Observations:
- Chlorine substitutions tend to pull the property toward slightly negative values but not as strongly as nitro (-NO₂) or amide (-CONH-) groups.
- The biphenyl core is hydrophobic, but the chlorines add some polarity.
- The symmetric substitution pattern may slightly reduce the impact of polarity compared to asymmetric cases.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (-0.11)** but with one fewer chlorine, the value should be slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.15**.

However, looking back at **Clc1ccccc1Cl (-0.2)**, which has fewer chlorines, and considering the biphenyl system's added hydrophobicity, the value might be closer to **-0.15 to -0.1**.  

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.12**.  

But to align with the trend, I'll refine it to:  
**-0.14**.  

### Final Answer:

Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (which is diethylbenzene, a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl substituents), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

Key observations:
1. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons** with alkyl substituents (e.g., toluene, ethylbenzene, or longer chains) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.78 to -1.11**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **-0.78**
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): **-0.98**
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): **-1.11**
2. The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** has two ethyl groups, which are moderately hydrophobic but lack strongly polar or electronegative substituents (like NO₂, OH, or halogens) that would push the value more negative.
3. The presence of two ethyl groups (slightly more hydrophobic than a single hexyl chain) suggests the value should be slightly more negative than hexylbenzene (-0.78) but less negative than benzaldehyde (-1.11).

Given these comparisons, the predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is likely around:  
**-0.85**  

This aligns well with the trend for alkyl-substituted aromatics in the dataset.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -1.07
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, which is a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2). This is similar to some of the given examples (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with a property of -1.58).
2. **Substituent**: The aniline is substituted with a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)**. This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group, similar in nature to nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) in terms of electronic effects but potentially more polar due to the sulfur atom.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -1.58 (nitro group on aniline).
- **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: Property = -1.98 (two nitro groups on a methyl-substituted benzene).
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**: Property = -1.65 (polar heterocycle with amino groups).
- **Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = -1.76 (phenol with a phenyl substituent).

The sulfonamide group is likely to have a similar or slightly stronger electron-withdrawing effect than a nitro group, but the overall property value should be in the same range as aniline derivatives with strong polar substituents.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-1.58) and the slightly more polar nature of the sulfonamide group, the predicted property for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** would be slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: -1.65**  

This aligns with the trend observed for polar aniline derivatives in the given examples.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -2.079999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. Its structure can be described as follows:
- It is a **tetracene derivative** (a linear arrangement of four fused benzene rings) or a **phenanthrene-like structure** (if the rings are angular). 
- The given SMILES notation suggests a **non-linear, angular arrangement** (more like a phenanthrene or chrysene structure), as the numbering indicates a bend in the ring system.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Fused Rings**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: -2.34): This is a complex PAH with multiple fused rings and a methyl group. The property is highly negative.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccccc2c34** (property: -2.6): This is very similar to the target molecule (a chrysene-like structure) and has a property of -2.6.
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: -1.82): A simpler PAH (methyl-substituted phenanthrene) with a less negative value.

2. **Impact of Substituents**:
   - Adding halogens (Cl, Br) or polar groups (NO2, OH, etc.) tends to make the property more negative (e.g., -0.69 for chlorinated benzenes, -1.38 for nitro-substituted aromatics).
   - Pure hydrocarbons (no substituents) like **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) or **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) have properties close to 0.0.

3. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - The more fused aromatic rings, the more negative the property tends to be (e.g., -2.6 for the chrysene-like structure above).

### Prediction for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**:
- This is a **chrysene-like structure** (four fused benzene rings in an angular arrangement).
- It is very similar to the example **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccccc2c34** (property: -2.6), except the latter has an extra fused benzene ring (making it slightly larger).
- The absence of substituents (pure hydrocarbon) suggests the property should be slightly less negative than -2.6 but still strongly negative due to the fused aromatic system.

### Final Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example with property -2.6 and adjusting for the slightly smaller size, the predicted property for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is:

**-2.34** (similar to other fused PAHs of this size in the dataset). 

This aligns with the trend that larger, more conjugated systems have more negative values, and this molecule fits between the simpler PAHs (-1.82) and the larger ones (-2.6).

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -2.8899999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O), which are highly polar and can contribute to negative property values (as seen in similar molecules like **Oc1cccc(O)c1** with -1.18).
2. **Aromatic Rings**: It has two aromatic rings (one fused with a lactone-like structure and another benzene ring), which are common in molecules with negative property values (e.g., **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** with -2.6).
3. **Oxygen-Rich Substituents**: The presence of multiple -OH groups and an ether linkage (Oc1c2) suggests significant hydrogen bonding potential, which correlates with more negative values (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** with -1.94).
4. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is moderately large and rigid due to the fused ring system, similar to **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (-3.27), though slightly less extended.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with 2-3 -OH groups and aromatic systems typically range between **-1.2 to -2.0** (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1** at -1.18, **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** at -3.27).
- The given molecule lacks extremely extended conjugation or additional electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or multiple halogens), so it likely falls in the middle of this range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the predicted property value for **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** is:  
**-2.35**  

This estimate balances the contributions of the polar groups, aromaticity, and molecular size while aligning with trends in the provided data.

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.009999999999999953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or electronegative groups (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, multiple halogens like Cl, or phosphate groups `P(=O)(OC)OC`) tend to have higher (less negative) property values. For example:
     - `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` has a high value of **2.57** due to many Cl atoms.
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.46** due to the phosphate and multiple Cl atoms.
   - Molecules with less polar or nonpolar groups (e.g., alkanes like `CCCCC`) have values close to **0.0**.

2. **Phosphate or Phosphorothioate Groups**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.46**.
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.07**.
   - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has **0.39**.
   - These suggest that phosphate/phosphorothioate groups contribute to higher (less negative) values, especially when combined with halogens or other electronegative groups.

3. **Amide or Carbamate Groups**:
   - Molecules with amide/carbamate groups (e.g., `NC(=O)`, `N(C(=O))`) tend to have more negative values. For example:
     - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has **-1.38**.
     - `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has **-3.02**.

4. **Hybrid Structures**:
   - Molecules with both polar (e.g., phosphate) and nonpolar (e.g., alkyl) groups tend to have intermediate values. For example:
     - `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl` has **-0.39**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**:
- It contains a **phosphate group** `P(=O)`, which typically increases the property value (less negative).
- It also contains an **amide group** `NC(C)=O`, which typically decreases the property value (more negative).
- The `SC` (thiolate or thiocarbonyl) group is moderately polar but less electronegative than halogens.
- No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups are present.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.07** (phosphate + multiple Cl atoms).
2. `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.46** (phosphorothioate + multiple Cl atoms).
3. `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl` has **-0.39** (phosphate + amide-like group + Cl).

The target molecule has:
- A phosphate group (like the above examples) but no halogens.
- An amide group (which would push the value more negative).
- A thiocarbonyl group (less impactful than halogens but somewhat polar).

Given the absence of halogens and the presence of the amide group, the value should be lower (more negative) than the phosphate-containing examples but not as extreme as highly nitrated or multi-amide molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the balance between the phosphate (increases value) and amide (decreases value), a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.25**  

This is slightly more negative than `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl` (-0.39) because the target molecule lacks the Cl atom but retains the amide and phosphate groups. The `SC` group is less impactful than Cl, so the value is less negative than -0.39 but still negative due to the amide.

### Final Answer:
**-0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.31999999999999995
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Small, non-polar/slightly polar molecules with simple structures** (e.g., **CC1CCCC1**, **CCCC(C)C**) tend to have a property value of **0.0** or close to it. These are typically hydrocarbons or very simple halogenated compounds without strong functional groups.

2. **Halogenated alkenes or small polar molecules** (e.g., **CCBr**, **CCCCBr**) have slightly positive values (e.g., **0.48** for bromoalkanes), while **Cl-substituted aromatics** (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**) have slightly negative values (e.g., **-0.4**).

3. The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, symmetrical dichlorinated alkene. It is more polar than simple alkanes but lacks the complexity or strong functional groups (like carbonyls, amines, or rings) that drive the property value significantly negative in the examples. 

4. Comparing to similar small halogenated molecules:
   - **CCBr** and **CCCCBr** have **0.48** (bromoalkanes are slightly more polarizable).
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has **0.18**, but it is much larger and more hydrophobic.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has **-0.4** due to the polar OH group.

Given that **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, relatively non-polar molecule (despite the C-Cl bonds), its property value is likely **close to 0**, but slightly positive due to the halogens. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

This aligns with the trend where small halogenated alkenes/alkanes have values slightly above 0 unless they contain strongly polar or functionalized groups.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.8500000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations:
1. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values around **-1.0 to -1.5**:
   - CNc1ccccc1 (N,N-dimethylaniline): **-0.98**
   - Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32 (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): **-1.56**
   - Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2ccccc2 (chlorinated biphenyl): **-0.98**

2. **Heteroaromatic rings** (e.g., nitrogen-containing) often have slightly more negative values than pure hydrocarbons:
   - COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (methylated purine-like structure): **-1.78**
   - Cc1ncnc2nccnc12 (methylated purine): **-1.58**
   - c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (nitrogen-rich polycycle): **-1.96**

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is a simple heteroaromatic with one nitrogen. Compared to benzene (which would likely be ~-1.0), the nitrogen introduces slight polarity and electron-withdrawing effects, pushing the value more negative.

### Comparison:
- Pyridine is less complex than most nitrogen-rich polycycles in the dataset (which range from -1.58 to -1.96) but more polar than simple benzenes (~-0.98 to -1.3).
- A reasonable estimate is between the simple aromatic and more complex heterocycles.

### Prediction:
The property value for **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)** is likely **-1.2**. 

This balances the influence of the nitrogen (making it more negative than benzene) while accounting for its simplicity compared to larger heterocycles.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -2.669999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **OCC(O)CO-**: A polyol-like fragment (similar to sugars or glycerol derivatives). From the examples, polyols like **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** have a value of **-0.24**, and **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **-0.2**. This suggests a slight negative contribution.
   - **-OC(=O)c1ccccc1-**: An ester-linked phenyl group. Examples like **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** have **-1.51**, and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** has **-1.84**. This suggests a significant negative contribution.
   - **-Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**: A substituted indole or quinoline-like system with a chlorine atom. Examples with aromatic N-heterocycles and halogens include:
     - **c1ccc2cnccc2c1** (**-1.37**),
     - **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** (**-1.89**),
     - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (**0.24**).
     The presence of **Cl** and the fused ring system likely adds some negative contribution but less than the ester-phenyl group.

2. **Combined Effects**:
   - The ester-phenyl group is the dominant negative contributor (likely around **-1.5** to **-1.8**).
   - The polyol fragment adds a slight negative effect (around **-0.2**).
   - The N-heterocycle with Cl might contribute around **-1.4** to **-1.8** based on similar structures.
   - The overall value should be more negative than any single fragment due to additive effects.

3. **Analogous Examples**:
   - **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (**-2.29**): This has two aromatic amide groups, which is somewhat analogous to the ester + N-heterocycle here.
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2** (**-1.59**): Contains an ester-phenyl group and a cyclic ether, similar to our polyol + ester-phenyl.
   - **CCN(CC)C(=O)C(C)Oc1cccc2ccccc12** (**-2.03**): Contains an ester-aromatic group and a fused ring system.

### Prediction:
Given the combined contributions of the polyol, ester-phenyl, and N-heterocycle with Cl, the property value is likely in the range of **-1.8 to -2.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -2.05**  

This aligns with the trends observed in the examples, where similar structural complexity and functional groups yield values in this range.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), we can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Simple aliphatic alcohols** (e.g., **OC1CCCCCCC1**, property = -0.04) and **aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, property = -0.78) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative.
2. The presence of an **-OH group** in **CCCCCO** suggests some polarity, but the aliphatic chain dominates the property value.
3. The molecule **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a property of **-0.04**, which is very close to zero, likely due to its cyclic structure and single -OH group.
4. **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol, and linear aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCC(=O)CCCC**, property = -0.33) tend to have slightly negative values.

### Comparison:
- **CCCCCO** is most similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, -0.04) but with a linear structure. Linear alcohols are slightly less polarizable than cyclic ones, so the value might be slightly more negative.
- It is also somewhat similar to **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** (nonanone, -0.33), but the -OH group in **CCCCCO** is less polarizing than the carbonyl (=O) group, so the value should be less negative.

### Prediction:
Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCO** is likely **close to -0.1**. However, looking at the trend for simple alcohols and aliphatic chains, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCO: -0.04**  
*(similar to OC1CCCCCCC1, as the -OH group and aliphatic chain balance out to a near-neutral value).*  

If we consider the linearity, it might be slightly more negative, so an alternative estimate could be **-0.1**, but the closest match in the dataset is **-0.04**. 

### Final answer:

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -1.8199999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** has a thiophene-fused benzene ring and a value of **-0.54**.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** has two benzene rings with amino groups and a value of **-1.96**.
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups and a value of **-1.18**.

2. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. Examples with sulfonyl or similar polar groups:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a phosphoryl group and a nitro group, with a value of **-1.01**.
   - **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** has a phosphoryl group and ester, with a value of **-0.94**.

3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is another polar group. Examples with amides:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** has multiple amides and a value of **-1.39**.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has an amide and a fluorine-substituted benzene, with a value of **-1.38**.

4. **Heterocycle (CCO1)**: The molecule has a 5-membered ring with oxygen and sulfur. Heterocycles often contribute to polarity:
   - **Cc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O** is a polar heterocycle with a value of **-1.32**.

### Comparison and Prediction:
- The molecule combines an aromatic ring, a sulfonyl group, an amide, and a heterocycle. These are all polar or electron-withdrawing features, which tend to lower the property value (more negative).
- The closest analogs are molecules like **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** (-0.94) and **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (-1.39), which have similar polar groups.
- The sulfonyl group is more electron-withdrawing than a simple ester or amide, so the value should be more negative than -0.94 but not as extreme as -1.96 (which has multiple strongly donating/withdrawing groups).

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1** is:

**-1.25**

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -3.16
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, I'll analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular properties like polarity, conjugation, functional groups, and molecular size/rigidity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group**: `c2ccccc2N(=O)=O` (similar to `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, which has a value of -1.38).
2. **Ester groups**: Two `C(=O)OC` groups (similar to `CCCCC(=O)OC`, which has -0.53, but here there are two esters).
3. **Conjugated system**: The molecule has extensive conjugation (aromatic ring + double bonds in the central ring + nitro group), which typically lowers the property value (more negative).
4. **Substituted heterocycle**: The central `NC(=C)C` structure resembles amide-like conjugation (similar to `O=C2NC(=O)C1...`, which has -1.39).
5. **Bulky/rigid structure**: The fused rings and substituents reduce flexibility (similar to polycyclic aromatics like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`, which has -3.12, but this is less extreme).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The nitro-aromatic + ester combination is seen in `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-1.38) and `CCCCC(=O)OC` (-0.53). The presence of both would likely push the value lower.
- The conjugated system is similar to `O=C2NC(=O)C1...` (-1.39) and `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (-1.97).
- The rigidity is less extreme than large polycyclics but more than simple aromatics.

### Predicted Value:
Given the combined effects of the nitro group, two esters, conjugation, and rigidity, the property value is likely in the range of **-2.0 to -2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -2.25**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the examples (e.g., -2.39 for `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` and -2.49 for `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23`).

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.3900000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests significant hydrogen-bonding capability and polarity.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, carbonyls) tend to have more negative property values (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, property = -1.12; **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**, property = -2.17).
   - Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **c1ccncc1**, property = -0.85; **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**, property = -1.65) also show negative values.
   - The cyclopropane ring is strained but neutral in polarity unless substituted with polar groups (here, it is flanked by two amides).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule is a cyclic diamide (similar to hydantoin or succinimide derivatives), which are highly polar and often have negative property values.
   - Examples like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -1.22) and **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = -2.17) suggest that diamides or cyclic amides fall in the range of **-1.0 to -2.5**.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the symmetry and two amide groups, the property value is likely more negative than simple amides but less negative than highly conjugated systems (e.g., **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, property = -1.76).
   - A reasonable estimate is **-1.5**, balancing the polarity of the amides and the neutral cyclopropane ring.

1. Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCC, CCC(C)(C)CC, CCC1CCCCC1) have a property value of 0.0.
2. Chlorinated compounds tend to have slightly negative values (e.g., Clc1ccccc1 = -0.49) unless they are highly chlorinated (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl = 0.38).
3. The simplest chlorinated alkane in the examples is CCl (not present, but similar to CC#N = -0.51).

For the molecule ClCC (chloroethane):
- It's a simple chlorinated alkane with only one chlorine substituent.
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - CC#N (acetonitrile) = -0.51
  - C1CC=CC1 (cyclopentene) = -0.26
  - Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) = -0.49

Given that ClCC is less conjugated than chlorobenzene but more polar than a simple alkane, a reasonable estimate would be between -0.2 and -0.5. 

A good prediction would be: **-0.35** (intermediate between the chlorobenzene and cyclopentene values, accounting for its simpler structure). 

This is a qualitative estimate based on the structural trends in the provided data.

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.3099999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**: -1.76 (diphenyl with one Cl substituent)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: -1.27 (diphenyl with one Cl substituent, similar to above but slightly less negative)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: -0.69 (diphenyl with multiple Cl substituents)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: -0.11 (heavily chlorinated, less negative)
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl**: 0.07 (hexachlorobenzene with NO2, slightly positive)

2. **Chlorinated Aliphatic Groups**:
   - **ClCC(Cl)Cl**: 0.87 (chloroform, highly positive)
   - **C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Not explicitly given, but similar to CCl4 (likely highly positive)
   - **BrC(Cl)Cl**: 1.06 (bromodichloromethane, highly positive)

3. **Combination of Aromatic and Aliphatic Chlorines**:
   - The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has:
     - A chlorinated pyridine ring (aromatic, similar to chlorobenzene).
     - A CCl3 group (aliphatic, similar to chloroform or CCl4).

### Key Trends:
- Aromatic chlorines tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
- Aliphatic chlorines (especially CCl3 or CCl4-like groups) tend to increase the property value (more positive).
- The presence of both aromatic and aliphatic chlorines may balance or offset these effects.

### Prediction for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl:
- The pyridine ring with one Cl substituent is similar to chlorobenzene (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, which is not explicitly given but likely similar to other mono-chlorinated aromatics, around -0.5 to -1.5).
- The CCl3 group is strongly positive (e.g., ClCC(Cl)Cl is 0.87, and CCl4 would likely be similar or higher).
- The net effect is likely a balance between the aromatic (negative contribution) and aliphatic (positive contribution) chlorines.

Given the examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a similar structure (aromatic + CCl3) and a value of -0.11.
- The pyridine ring (n1) may be slightly more electron-withdrawing than benzene, but the CCl3 group dominates.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is approximately:  
**0.39**  

This aligns with the trend where heavily chlorinated aliphatic groups (CCl3) push the value toward the positive side, while the aromatic chlorine has a modest opposing effect. The value is similar to other molecules with CCl3 groups (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...** is 0.39). 

### Final Answer:
**0.39**

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and trends observed in the data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol, a branched alcohol with a hydroxyl group).

### Observations from the data:
1. **Alcohols (OH group)** tend to have negative property values, but the magnitude depends on the structure:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear alcohol, likely 3-hexanol) has a value of **-0.04**.
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol, likely 2-methyl-1-pentanol) has a value of **-0.04**.
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (another branched alcohol, likely 3-methyl-1-pentanol) also has a value of **-0.04**.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (aromatic alcohol, 1-phenylethanol) has a value of **-0.82**, but this is influenced by the aromatic ring.

2. **Branching vs. linear alcohols**:
   - The property value seems similar for linear and branched alcohols when the OH group is primary (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCCC(O)CCC** both have **-0.04**).
   - The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** has a secondary OH group (2-hexanol), which may slightly lower the property value compared to primary alcohols due to increased steric effects or polarity.

3. **Other trends**:
   - Non-polar alkanes (e.g., **CCCCCCCCl**) have positive or near-zero values.
   - Polar or functionalized molecules (especially those with multiple polar groups or conjugated systems) tend to have more negative values.

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O**:
- This is a branched alcohol with a secondary OH group. Comparing it to similar alcohols in the dataset:
  - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Linear alcohol, **-0.04**.
  - **CCC(C)CCO**: Branched primary alcohol, **-0.04**.
  - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Secondary alcohol with aromatic ring, **-0.82** (aromaticity lowers the value further).

Since **CCCCC(C)O** is a secondary alcohol but lacks aromaticity or additional polar groups, its value should be slightly more negative than the primary alcohols but not as extreme as aromatic alcohols. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.1** and **-0.2**.

### Final predicted value:
**-0.15** (interpolated based on the trends). 

However, since the given examples of similar alcohols cluster around **-0.04**, and secondary alcohols might not deviate significantly in this context, another plausible prediction is **-0.04** (same as the other simple alcohols). 

Given the data, the most consistent answer is:  
**-0.04** (same as the other branched/linear alcohols in the dataset). 

But if we account for the secondary OH group, a slight adjustment to **-0.1** could also be justified. 

Given the examples, **-0.04** is the safest prediction. 

**Predicted property value: -0.04**

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.17999999999999994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.98**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a biphenyl with chlorines) has a value of **-0.98**.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol) has a value of **-0.4**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (a complex chloro-substituted aromatic) has a value of **-2.73**.

2. **Effect of Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, but the electronegativity difference is smaller (Br is less electronegative than Cl). This may slightly reduce the electron-withdrawing effect compared to chlorine.
   - However, the property values for chloro-substituted aromatics are already quite negative (e.g., -0.98 for dichlorobenzene), suggesting that halogen substitution contributes significantly to the property.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - The molecule is symmetric (1,4-disubstitution), similar to 1,4-dichlorobenzene (-0.98). Symmetric substitution tends to stabilize the molecule, but the property value is still negative due to the halogens.

4. **Comparison to Non-Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - Simple aromatics like **c1ccccc1** (benzene) are not in the examples, but substituted aromatics with halogens consistently show negative values.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a value of **-0.98**,
- Bromine is less electronegative but larger, which may slightly offset the effect,
- The symmetric 1,4-disubstitution pattern is similar,

the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene) is likely **slightly less negative** than for 1,4-dichlorobenzene due to the reduced electron-withdrawing effect of Br compared to Cl. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.85** (slightly less negative than -0.98 for the chloro analog). 

This aligns with the trend that heavier halogens (Br vs. Cl) in similar structures yield slightly less negative values while still being strongly influenced by the halogen substitution.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.17999999999999983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl derivative** (two benzene rings connected, with multiple chlorine substituents). 
2. It is highly chlorinated, similar to the second example in the list: **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which has a property value of **1.34**. 
3. The given molecule has slightly fewer chlorine atoms (6 Cl) compared to the example (10 Cl), but the core structure (biphenyl with heavy chlorination) is very similar.

### Key Observations:
- Chlorination increases the property value (as seen in the first two examples: **ClC(Br)Br = 1.25**, and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl = **1.34**).
- The biphenyl scaffold with chlorine substituents tends to have higher values (≥1.25).
- The given molecule is less chlorinated than the second example (1.34), so its value should be slightly lower but still >1.25.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity and the trend in chlorination, the predicted value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:

**1.30** (slightly lower than the heavily chlorinated biphenyl example but higher than simpler chlorinated structures). 

This is a reasonable interpolation based on the provided data.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -2.709999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular polarity, functional groups, and overall hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Here's the reasoning:

### Given molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Multiple benzene rings (3 in total) with methyl substituents (hydrophobic contribution).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(...)...)**: Highly polar and negatively charged at physiological pH (strong hydrophilic contribution).
3. **Ether linkages (Oc2... and Oc3...)**: Polar but not as strongly hydrophilic as the phosphate.
4. **Methyl groups (C)**: Hydrophobic.

### Comparison to examples:
- Molecules with phosphate groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a property of -0.43; `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` has 1.27, but the latter is less polar overall).
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` has -2.0; `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has -1.09).
- The phosphate group here is more polar than most examples, but the hydrophobic aromatic rings and methyl groups balance it somewhat.

### Predicted property:
Given the strong polarity of the phosphate group combined with the hydrophobic aromatic systems, the property value is likely in the moderately negative range. The closest analogs suggest a value around **-1.5 to -2.0**. 

Considering the balance between the phosphate and the bulky hydrophobic groups, the predicted property is:  
**-1.65**

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.9400000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: The presence of **CF3** is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which often contributes to more negative property values (e.g., see **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, -0.4** where multiple halogens reduce the value).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The **CF3** is attached to a benzene ring, similar to **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, -1.38**, where electron-withdrawing nitro groups reduce the value.
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle**: The **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** moiety contains two chlorines and a ketone, which are polar and electron-withdrawing (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl, 1.86** shows highly chlorinated structures can have extreme values, but here the effect is moderated by the rest of the structure).
4. **Amide-like linkage**: The nitrogen connecting the aromatic ring to the chlorinated ring is part of a lactam (cyclic amide), which is polar and can hydrogen bond, similar to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1, -1.51**.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The **CF3** and **Cl** substitutions are analogous to molecules like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, 0.47**, but this molecule has fewer chlorines and a more balanced structure.
- The **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** group resembles polar, halogenated cyclic structures (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, -1.45**), but with additional halogens.
- The overall polarity and electron-withdrawing nature suggest a property value more negative than simple aromatics (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1C, -0.78**) but less extreme than highly chlorinated or polycyclic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combined effects of **CF3**, **chlorines**, and the polar lactam, the property value is likely in the range of **-1.5 to -2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -1.75**  

This aligns with similarly substituted polar, halogenated aromatic systems in the examples (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C, -1.77**).
==================================================
Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.58
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring with Nitro Group (-NO2)**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**). From the examples:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-1.98**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which tends to lower the property value.

2. **Methoxy Group (-OCH3)**: The benzene ring also has a methoxy substituent (**COc**). From the examples:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **-0.98**.
   - Methoxy is less electron-withdrawing than nitro but still contributes to lowering the property value.

3. **Combined Substituents**: The presence of both nitro and methoxy groups on the benzene ring suggests additive effects. The nitro group's influence is stronger, but the methoxy group moderates it slightly compared to dinitrobenzene.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -1.98 (two nitro groups, very low value).
- **c1ccccc1O**: -0.98 (only hydroxy group).
- **O=Cc1ccco1**: -1.05 (aromatic with electron-withdrawing carbonyl).
- **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC**: -1.84 (aromatic with two ester groups).

Given that **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one nitro group and one methoxy group, its value should be between the phenol (-0.98) and dinitrobenzene (-1.98). The nitro group dominates, so we expect a value closer to -1.5 to -1.8.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-1.65**  

This accounts for the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group and the moderate effect of the methoxy group.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 2.06
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule is heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (8 Cl atoms), similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane, property value: **1.74**) and **BrC(Br)Br** (bromotrichloromethane, property value: **1.44**). These highly halogenated compounds tend to have **positive property values** due to their lipophilicity and lack of polar functional groups.

2. **Rigid Polycyclic Framework**: The molecule has a complex, rigid polycyclic structure with multiple fused rings, which is somewhat analogous to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (also rigid and cyclic). Such structures often exhibit higher property values compared to flexible or less halogenated molecules.

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.58**.
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane) has a property value of **1.74**.
   - The given molecule has even more chlorine atoms and a more constrained structure, suggesting a **higher value than 1.74**.

4. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: While chlorine is electronegative, the sheer number of Cl atoms and the steric crowding likely dominate, pushing the property value further into the positive range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** is:  
**2.10**  

This is higher than hexachlorocyclohexane (1.74) due to the additional Cl atoms and increased steric/electronic effects.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that might apply to this structure.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) has a value of **0.0**, indicating minimal contribution from non-polar hydrocarbons.
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne) has **-0.44**, suggesting triple bonds slightly lower the value.
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (non-1-ene) has **-0.26**, showing a modest effect from a double bond.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has **-1.51**, likely due to the ester group and aromatic amine.
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenylethanol) has **-0.82**, showing the effect of an alcohol.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C(C)C** (a cyclic imide) has **-1.65**, indicating carbonyl groups lower the value.

3. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has **-2.69**, but this is a complex ester with additional aromatic and ether groups.
   - Simpler esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (**-1.51**) suggest esters typically range between **-1.0 to -2.0**.

4. **Aldehydes (RCHO)**:
   - The **C=O** in **CCCOC=O** is an aldehyde (formate ester), which is more polar than ketones or esters alone. 
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile, a polar nitrile) has **-0.51**, suggesting polar groups lower the value.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is **propyl formate**, an ester with a small formyl group (**HC=O**) attached to an oxygen and propyl chain.
- Compared to other esters in the dataset (e.g., **-1.51** for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), this is a simpler ester but with an aldehyde-like character (more polar).
- The propyl group is non-polar, but the **C=O** and **O** linkage add polarity.
- Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.8 and -1.2**.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.0** (rounded to match the precision of the given examples). 

This aligns with the observed effects of esters and polar groups in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: The molecule has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons, including the carbonyl carbon). From the examples:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a value of **-0.78**.
   - **CC** (ethane) has a value of **0.0**, indicating that longer chains tend to decrease the property value slightly.
   - The chain here is longer than hexyl, so this would likely contribute to a more negative value.

2. **Ester Functional Group (C(=O)OCC)**: The molecule is an ester (specifically, decyl acetate with an ethyl group instead of methyl). From the examples:
   - Esters like **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** have a value of **-1.88**, but this is a more complex ester.
   - Simpler esters or ethers (e.g., **CCOc1ccccc1**) have values around **-0.98**.
   - The ester group is polar and would contribute to a more negative value than a pure hydrocarbon.

3. **Lack of Aromaticity or Other Functional Groups**: The molecule has no aromatic rings or highly polar groups (like -OH, -NO2, halogens), which often lead to more negative values. This suggests the value will be less negative than molecules with those features.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **-0.78** (aromatic + aliphatic chain).
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: **-0.63** (steroid-like, with ketone and alcohol).
- **CCCCC(CC)C=O**: **-0.33** (aliphatic aldehyde).
- **CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C**: **-1.93** (complex ester with multiple functional groups).

Given that **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a simple ester with a long aliphatic chain, its value should be between the aliphatic aldehyde (**-0.33**) and the hexylbenzene (**-0.78**), but slightly more negative due to the ester group. 

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.65**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.65**

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -2.3099999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.69), but with additional substitutions.
   - Phenolic groups (OH attached to benzene) tend to lower the property value (more negative).

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Present in molecules like **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = -1.31) and **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (property = -2.17).
   - Amides generally contribute to more negative values.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -1.09) and **NNc1ccccc1** (property = -1.02).
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and lower the property value.

4. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**: 
   - Multiple Cl atoms, as in **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property = -1.09), contribute to more negative values.
   - Chlorine is moderately electron-withdrawing.

5. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - The molecule has two benzene rings, similar to **O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)c3ccccc13** (property = -2.22) or **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23** (property = -1.34).
   - Extended conjugation tends to lower the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is structurally complex, combining features from several examples:
  - Phenol + amide + nitro + Cl substitutions.
  - The closest analogs are:
    - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (-2.17): amide + aromatic.
    - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (-1.09): phenol + multiple Cl.
    - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-1.09): nitro + Cl.
    - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (-1.31): amide + aromatic.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Phenol (-0.69),
- Amide (-1.31),
- Nitro (-1.09),
- Multiple Cl (-1.09),
- Extended conjugation (-2.22 for a similar system),

the property value is likely more negative than any single contributing group. The additive effect suggests a value around **-2.0 to -2.5**. 

From the examples, the most similar complex molecule is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (-2.17), which also has an amide and aromatic rings. Adding the nitro group and Cl substitutions would push the value further negative, but not drastically (since nitro and Cl are already accounted for in other examples). 

Thus, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-2.2** (similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** but slightly more negative due to the nitro group).

### Final Answer:
**-2.3** (rounded from the estimated range). 

However, looking at the examples, **-2.2** is a very close match for similarly complex molecules, so I'll refine to:  
**Predicted property value: -2.2**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.4700000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC))**: The molecule contains two **P(=S)(OC)** groups, which are polar and electron-withdrawing. Similar groups appear in other molecules in the dataset (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, property = **-0.1**), where they contribute to moderately negative property values.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Thioether Linkage (Sc1ccc...cc1)**: The molecule has two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur (thioether) bridge. Thioethers are moderately polar but less electron-withdrawing than halogens or carbonyls. Examples like **CCSSCC** (property = **0.7**) suggest sulfur can increase the property value, but here the effect is offset by the phosphorothioate groups.

3. **Lack of Strongly Electron-Withdrawing Groups (e.g., NO₂, CF₃)**: Unlike some examples with very negative values (e.g., **-2.59** for a molecule with multiple carbonyls and halogens), this molecule lacks extreme electron-withdrawing or donating groups.

4. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, which may balance out polar effects. Large aromatic systems with moderate polarity (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**, property = **0.18**) tend to have near-neutral or slightly positive values, but the phosphorothioates here likely pull the value downward.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **-0.1**): This has a phosphorothioate and a polar amide group, yielding a slightly negative value. Our molecule has two phosphorothioates but no additional strong polar groups, so the value might be similar or slightly more negative.
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property = **-0.69**): This has halogenated aromatics, which are somewhat analogous in polarity to the thioether-linked aromatics here, but our molecule lacks halogens and has phosphorothioates instead.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of moderately polar phosphorothioates and the thioether-linked aromatic system, the property value is likely slightly negative but not extreme. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.5**  

This aligns with the trend of molecules combining moderate polar groups (P=S, S-aryl) without strongly electron-withdrawing or donating substituents.

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.58
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has a property value of **-1.51**. This is a phenol derivative with an amide group at the ortho position relative to the hydroxyl group.
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has a property value of **-0.98**. This is a phenol with methyl substituents.
   - The hydroxyl group (OH) on an aromatic ring tends to lower the property value (more negative).

2. **Nitro Group (NO₂)**: 
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrobenzene derivative) has a property value of **-1.38**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and tends to lower the property value significantly.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - When both hydroxyl and nitro groups are present on the same aromatic ring, their effects are additive or synergistic, leading to more negative property values.
   - For example, **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a property value of **-1.78**, which includes a nitro group and an ether-linked aromatic ring with chloro substituents.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, which is:
- A **phenol** (hydroxyl group on benzene) with a **nitro group (NO₂)** at the para position relative to the hydroxyl group.

Given the examples:
- Phenol with an amide: **-1.51**
- Nitrobenzene: **-1.38**
- The combined effect of OH and NO₂ is likely more negative than either alone.

### Prediction:
The presence of both OH and NO₂ (strong electron-withdrawing groups) will lead to a more negative property value than either group alone. Comparing to similar structures:
- The closest analog is **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (**-1.78**), but this has additional chloro substituents that may further lower the value.
- Without the chloro groups, the value should be slightly less negative but still in the range of **-1.5 to -1.7**.

Given that **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (phenol with amide) is **-1.51** and **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrobenzene) is **-1.38**, the combined effect of OH + NO₂ is likely around **-1.6**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **-1.62**. 

(Note: This is an estimate based on the given examples and structural trends. The actual value may vary slightly depending on finer electronic or steric effects not captured in the examples.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.64
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to be related to **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which measures a molecule's hydrophobicity (lipophilicity). Negative values indicate higher hydrophilicity (water solubility), while positive values indicate higher hydrophobicity (lipid solubility).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule is a **complex carbohydrate (oligosaccharide/polysaccharide-like structure)** with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (O-C-O). Key features:
- **Highly polar**: Numerous -OH groups form strong hydrogen bonds with water.
- **No hydrophobic groups**: No long alkyl chains, aromatic rings, or halogens.
- **Similar to sugars**: Compare to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = -0.2), which is a simple sugar (e.g., glucose derivative).

### Prediction:
The molecule is **extremely hydrophilic** due to:
1. **High density of -OH groups** (8 -OH groups visible in the structure).
2. **Lack of hydrophobic moieties** (no alkyl chains, halogens, or aromatic rings).
3. **Comparison to simpler sugars**: Even a small sugar like `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a property of -0.2. This larger, more polar molecule will have a much more negative value.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trend:
- Simple sugar: -0.2  
- Larger sugars/polyols: More negative (e.g., sucrose-like structures would be ~-1.0 to -2.0).  
- This molecule is **larger and more polar** than most examples, so we expect a **very negative value**.

**Predicted Property: ~-2.7**  
(More negative than any example provided, reflecting extreme hydrophilicity.)  

### Note:
Without explicit training data for very large sugars, this is an extrapolation based on the trend that more -OH groups → more negative logP. If the actual scale is bounded differently, the value might be closer to -2.0 to -3.0.  

**Final Answer: -2.7**

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.44
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., CCCC(O)CCC, CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO) tend to have property values close to **-0.04**, indicating minimal contribution to the property.
2. **Alkenes** (e.g., CCCCCCCC=C) have a slightly more negative value (**-0.26**), suggesting a small effect from the double bond.
3. **Alkynes** (e.g., N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which contains two C≡N groups) have a more negative value (**-1.8**), but this is influenced by the aromatic ring and nitrile groups. A simpler alkyne (like 1-butyne) would likely have a less extreme value.
4. **Functional groups** like carbonyls, halogens, and nitro groups tend to push the property further negative or positive depending on their electronegativity/polarity.

### Prediction for CCC#C:
- The molecule is a simple terminal alkyne (no aromaticity or other functional groups).
- Compared to alkanes (~-0.04) and alkenes (~-0.26), the triple bond in alkynes is more polarizable and electron-rich, which would likely make the property more negative than alkenes but less extreme than conjugated or functionalized alkynes.
- A reasonable estimate is between the alkene value (-0.26) and the nitrile-containing alkyne (-1.8), but closer to the alkene due to the lack of additional functionalization.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.45**  

This reflects the intermediate effect of the alkyne group between alkenes and more polarized alkynes in the dataset.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.4999999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.1) and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property = -0.14). These molecules have moderately negative values.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions**: The **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** fragment resembles **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = -1.78) and **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.09). Multiple chlorines tend to reduce the property value, but the presence of an oxygen (ether linkage) further decreases it.
3. **Ethoxy and ethyl groups (CCOP and CC)**: These are relatively neutral contributors, similar to **CCCCOCCCC** (property = -0.04).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is structurally closest to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.1), but with an extra chlorine and an ethyl group instead of a methyl group. The additional chlorine would likely push the value more negative.
- Another similar molecule is **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = -1.78), but our molecule lacks the nitro group, which is highly electron-withdrawing. Thus, our value should be less negative than -1.78.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the moderately negative influence of the **P=S** group and the strongly negative influence of the **tri-chlorinated aromatic ring**, the predicted property value is likely around **-0.8 to -1.2**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.0**  

This aligns with the trends observed in the examples, where similar structures (P=S + chlorinated aromatics) fall in this range.

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -1.42
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc...)** with a substituent **C(=O)NN** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and contributes to hydrophobicity/electron-withdrawing effects.
   - The substituent **C(=O)NN** is a **hydrazide group**, which is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar/hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -NO2, -CONH, etc.)** tend to have more negative property values (e.g., -0.93 for **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**, -1.85 for **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2**).
   - Simple aromatic systems with halogens or alkyl groups tend to have less negative or positive values (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl** at -0.2, **CCCCBr** at 0.48).
   - The **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** is highly polar, similar to amides or ureas in the examples, which often push the property value toward more negative numbers (e.g., -1.51 for **c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)**).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (indole-like, -1.5): Less polar than our molecule but still aromatic with an NH group.
   - **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2** (polar heterocycle with H-bonding, -1.85): Similar polarity/H-bonding capacity to our hydrazide-substituted pyridine.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (polar amide with aromatic system, -0.93): Less polar than our hydrazide but structurally somewhat similar.

### Prediction:
Given the **pyridine ring + hydrazide group**, the molecule is highly polar and capable of strong hydrogen bonding. This suggests a property value more negative than simple aromatic systems but comparable to other polar heterocycles. 

Looking at the examples:
- The closest analogs (e.g., **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2** at -1.85, **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** at -0.93) suggest a range of **-1.5 to -2.0**.
- The hydrazide group is more polar than a simple amide, so we lean toward the more negative end of this range.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.75** (approximately midway between -1.5 and -2.0, accounting for the pyridine's moderate polarity and the hydrazide's strong H-bonding effects). 

This aligns well with the trend observed in the examples for similar polar aromatic systems.

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.38999999999999985
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, similar groups like **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** have a value of **-1.01**. Phosphorothioates tend to lower the property value due to their polarity and partial negative charge on sulfur.

2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: This is a polar and electron-withdrawing group. Examples like **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** have a value of **-0.73**, and **CCOC(=O)N** also has **-0.73**. Amides generally contribute to lower property values.

3. **Alkyl chains (CCCC, OCCC, etc.)**: These are non-polar and have minimal effect on the property value unless they are very long or branched. Here, they are moderate in length.

4. **Cyclohexane ring (N1CCCCC1)**: This is a non-polar, aliphatic ring. Similar structures like **C/C1CCCCC1\C** have a value of **0.0**, but when combined with polar groups, the overall value tends to decrease.

5. **Thioether linkage (SCC)**: This is moderately polar but less so than an oxygen ether. It may slightly lower the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is somewhat similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (value = **-1.01**), but with additional non-polar alkyl chains and an amide group instead of a nitro group. The amide is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, so the value might be slightly higher (less negative) than **-1.01**.
- The presence of the **C(=O)N** group (as in **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**, value = **-0.73**) suggests a significant contribution toward a negative value.
- The alkyl chains and cyclohexane ring offset some of the polarity, but the **P(=S)** and **C(=O)N** groups dominate.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the balance of polar (P(=S), C(=O)N) and non-polar (alkyl chains, cyclohexane) groups, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.9 to -1.1**. A reasonable estimate is:

**-0.95**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular polarity, functional groups, and structural features. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no polar functional groups or aromaticity, the property value is likely to be close to **0.0**. This is consistent with similar non-polar, aliphatic hydrocarbons in the dataset, such as:

- `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclohexane with no polar groups): **0.0**
- `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (non-polar aliphatic cyclic/linear mix): **0.0**
- `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol, very slight polarity due to terminal -OH but still close to **-0.04**).

Since octane has no polar or aromatic features, the predicted property value is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -1.11
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (tetracyclic), similar to some of the provided examples (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, which has a value of **-0.63**).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - A **ketone (=O)** group, which is polar and often associated with negative values (e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has **-0.96**).
   - A **hydroxyl (OH)** group, which is polar (e.g., **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **-0.24**).
   - An **alkyne (C#C)** group, which is less polar but adds complexity.
3. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is large and has polar groups, which typically result in negative values (as seen in most examples). The presence of multiple rings and polar groups suggests a moderately negative value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**: This has a ketone and hydroxyl group, similar to our molecule, and a value of **-0.63**.
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: This has two ketones and a hydroxyl group, with a value of **-0.96**.
- Our molecule has one ketone, one hydroxyl, and an alkyne, placing it between these two in terms of polarity/complexity.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarities and trends in the examples, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C** is:

**-0.75**  

This is a reasonable estimate based on its intermediate polarity and complexity compared to the provided examples.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -3.3299999999999996
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to be related to molecular hydrophobicity (logP) or a similar physicochemical property, as the values range from negative (more hydrophilic) to positive (more hydrophobic). The molecule in question is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, and a ketone), which generally increase hydrophilicity (lower logP).

Breaking down the molecule:
- It has multiple methoxy (OCH3) and hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are polar and decrease logP.
- It contains a sugar-like moiety (tetrahydrofuran and pyran rings with multiple hydroxyl groups), which is highly hydrophilic.
- The aromatic rings with oxygen substituents further reduce hydrophobicity.
- There are no long alkyl chains or highly hydrophobic groups (e.g., halogens, large aromatic systems without polar substituents) to offset the polarity.

Comparing to similar examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., sugars, polyols) or conjugated polar systems tend to have logP values in the range of -1.5 to -3.0.
- The presence of multiple ethers and alcohols (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -0.69; `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)c1ccccc1` has -2.43) suggests this molecule will be quite hydrophilic.

Given the high density of polar oxygen functionalities and the absence of hydrophobic counterbalances, the predicted property value is likely on the more negative side of the observed range. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -2.8**  

This aligns with the trend that highly oxygenated, polyol-like structures (e.g., carbohydrate derivatives) exhibit strongly negative logP values.

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6900000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Substituents and Their Effects**:
   - **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, halogens like Cl, Br, I)** tend to increase the property value (less negative or more positive).
   - **Electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, OCH₃, alkyl groups)** tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - The position and number of substituents also matter. For example, multiple halogens or bulky groups can push the value higher.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (phenol with NO₂) has a property value of **-1.58**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) is not explicitly given, but we can infer its value is likely more negative than -1.58 due to the absence of the electron-withdrawing NO₂ group.
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chlorobenzene with iodine) has a value of **0.24**.
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) has a value of **-0.85**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) is not given, but **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has a value of **-0.98**, suggesting that adding more halogens or aromatic rings affects the value.

3. **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (chlorophenol):
   - The **OH group** is electron-donating (lowers the property value).
   - The **Cl group** is electron-withdrawing (increases the property value).
   - The net effect will depend on the balance between these two substituents. 

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: OH (donating) + NO₂ (strong withdrawing) → **-1.58**.
- **Fc1ccccc1**: F (withdrawing, but less than Cl) → **-0.85**.
- **Clc1ccccc1I**: Cl and I (both withdrawing) → **0.24**.
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl**: OH (donating) + Cl (withdrawing) → Likely between **-1.58** and **-0.85**, closer to **-1.0** because Cl is less withdrawing than NO₂ but more than F.

### Predicted Value:
Given the competing effects of OH (donating) and Cl (withdrawing), and comparing with similar molecules, the property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is likely around:

**-1.05** (approximately between -1.58 and -0.85, closer to -1.0). 

However, looking at **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (-0.98), which has two Cl groups and two aromatic rings, and **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-1.58), a reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:

**-1.10** (slightly more negative than -0.98 due to the OH group's donating effect). 

But since **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is -1.58 and **Oc1ccccc1Cl** lacks the strong NO₂ group, a more precise estimate is:

**-1.15** (accounting for OH's stronger donating effect than Cl's withdrawing effect in this context). 

After reconsidering the examples, the closest analog is **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-1.58), and replacing NO₂ with Cl (less withdrawing) would increase the value. Thus, a refined prediction is:

**-1.25** (interpolating between -1.58 and -0.85). 

However, given the variability in the data, the most consistent estimate is:

**-1.20** (a balance between the OH and Cl effects). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-1.20**.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -1.3699999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)...` in some examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (seen in many examples, e.g., `-1.31`, `-1.51`).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly in examples, but similar to unsaturated bonds contributing to polarity).
   - **Chlorinated aliphatic chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` with property `0.29`, but here combined with other polar groups).
   - **Ether linkage**: `COC` (seen in examples like `-0.08`, `-1.51`).

2. **Polarity and Contributions**:
   - The molecule has multiple polar groups (amide, Cl, ether) and an alkyne, which likely increase its overall polarity.
   - The Cl-substituted aromatic ring and amide are common in examples with values around `-1.2` to `-1.5`.
   - The alkyne and additional Cl might slightly raise the value compared to simpler amide/Cl-aromatic systems.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (property `-1.51`): Similar ether + amide + aromatic.
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property `-1.01`): Cl-aromatic but no amide.
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property `-0.94`): Complex Cl/amide system.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of the amide, Cl-substituted aromatic, and ether/alkyne, the property is likely in the range of **-1.2 to -1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: -1.35**  

This balances the contributions of the polar groups and aligns with similar molecules in the dataset.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, which is a 2-aminopyrimidine or similar heterocycle),
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (both with **Cl** substitution, which slightly increases hydrophobicity but also adds polarity).
   - A polar **OH** group (lowers the property value).
   - A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**, which is polar and likely lowers the property value).
   - No long aliphatic chains or highly hydrophobic groups (e.g., no **CCCC**).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **OH** + aromatic rings + polar groups tend to have property values between **-1.5 and -2.5** (e.g., **-1.64**, **-1.76**, **-2.17**, **-2.27**).
   - The presence of two **Cl** atoms and the heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**) suggests additional polarity, pushing the value further negative.
   - Similar complex structures with **OH**, **Cl**, and nitrogen heterocycles (e.g., **-2.17**, **-2.27**, **-2.42**) support a value around **-2.2 to -2.5**.

4. **Closest Analogues**:
   - **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = **-2.17**): Similar **OH**, **Cl**, and nitrogen-containing rings.
   - **CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C** (property = **-2.42**): Nitrogen-rich aromatic system.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (property = **-1.07**): Less complex but with polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of **OH**, two **Cl**-substituted phenyl rings, and a polar heterocycle, the property value is likely **-2.3** (midway between **-2.17** and **-2.42** for similar structures).

### Final Answer:
**-2.3**
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: Tend to decrease the property value (more negative). For example:
     - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** has a value of -0.53.
     - **CCCC=O** has a value of -0.33.
     - **O=Cc1ccco1** has a value of -1.05.
   - **Ethers (C-O-C)**: Often contribute to a slight decrease in the property value. For example:
     - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1** has a value of -1.71.
     - **CC(=O)OCC** has a value of -0.53.
   - **Alkyl chains (e.g., CCC)**: Tend to increase the property value (less negative or positive). For example:
     - **CCCCBr** has a value of 0.48.
     - **CCCCCC=O** has a value of -0.33 (the carbonyl dominates over the alkyl chain).

2. **Combination of Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule **CCCCOC=O** contains:
     - An alkyl chain (**CCCC**).
     - An ether linkage (**O**).
     - A carbonyl group (**C=O**).
   - The carbonyl group is likely the dominant feature, pulling the property value into the negative range.
   - The ether and alkyl chain may slightly offset this effect, but not enough to make the value positive or near zero.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCC=O** (butanal) has a value of -0.33.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate) has a value of -0.53.
   - **CCCCOC=O** is similar to butanal with an additional ether oxygen, which may slightly increase the polarity and thus make the property value more negative than butanal but less negative than ethyl acetate.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the carbonyl group and the ether linkage, the property value for **CCCCOC=O** is expected to be slightly more negative than **CCCC=O (-0.33)** but less negative than **CC(=O)OCC (-0.53)**. 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.4**.

However, looking more closely at the examples, **CCCC=O** is -0.33, and adding an ether oxygen (which is more polarizable) might further decrease the value slightly. A better estimate might be closer to **-0.5**, similar to **CC(=O)OCC**.

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.5**  

But to match the precision of the given examples (all to two decimal places), I'll round to:  
**-0.50**  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **-0.50**.
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.58
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with simple halogenated alkanes tends to be positive. For instance:

- **ClCCCl** has a property value of **0.58** (similar structure with two chlorines and a two-carbon chain).
- **CCBr** has a property value of **0.48** (brominated alkane with a short carbon chain).

The molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is even simpler, with just one carbon and two chlorines. Given the trend that smaller halogenated alkanes have positive values, but slightly less than their longer-chain counterparts (due to reduced molecular complexity/polarizability), a reasonable prediction would be slightly lower than **ClCCCl** but still positive.

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is approximately **0.50**. 

(Note: If the property is logP, this aligns with dichloromethane's known moderate hydrophobicity.)  

**Final answer: 0.50**
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.98
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with the structure:
- A benzene ring with:
  - A methyl group (`C`) at position 1.
  - Another methyl group (`C`) at an unspecified position (likely position 4, given the SMILES notation).
  - A hydroxyl group (`O`) at position 1 (implied by the `O` outside the ring).

This is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = -0.98) and **CC1CCCO1** (property = -0.04), but the phenol group is a key differentiating factor.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol): -1.18
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (nitrophenol): -1.58
   - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (methyl-substituted phenol): -0.98
   - Phenol-like structures tend to have property values between -0.98 and -1.76, depending on substituents.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Methyl groups (`C`) tend to increase the property value (make it less negative) compared to polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., `NO2`, `F`, `Cl`).
   - For example:
     - `CC(C)C(C)O` (tertiary alcohol): -0.04
     - `CCCC(=O)CC` (ketone): -0.33
     - `CCCCCCCCBr` (bromoalkane): 0.48

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The presence of two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group suggests a balance between hydrophobic (methyl) and polar (hydroxyl) contributions.
   - The property is likely closer to **-0.98** (from `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`) than to more polar phenols like `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (-1.18).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-0.98) and the slightly less substituted nature of **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, the property value is expected to be **slightly higher (less negative)** than -0.98. 

However, the exact position of the methyl groups matters. If the second `C` is at position 4 (para to the hydroxyl), the symmetry might slightly lower the value compared to meta-substitution. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.90**  

(Note: If the methyl groups are ortho to each other, steric effects might further influence the value, but without explicit positions, -0.90 is a plausible intermediate.) 

### Final Answer:
**-0.90**
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.4000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **-0.11**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **0.18**.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl** has a property value of **0.18**.

   These molecules are heavily chlorinated aromatic systems. The property values tend to be slightly negative or slightly positive, depending on the degree of chlorination and symmetry.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is a **biphenyl system with chlorine substitutions** (similar to the second example above but with fewer chlorines). It has two phenyl rings connected, with chlorines at the 2, 4, and 2' positions (and likely some symmetry).

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.18), but with fewer chlorines. Fewer chlorines typically reduce the property value slightly (as seen in the trend from -0.11 to 0.18 with increasing chlorination).
   - The biphenyl core with chlorines suggests a slightly negative or near-zero property value.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and chlorination pattern, the property value is likely **close to 0.0 but slightly positive**, similar to the other chlorinated biphenyl examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.08**  

(Note: If forced to pick from the closest examples, it would likely fall between **-0.11 and 0.18**, leaning toward the lower end due to fewer chlorines than the 0.18 case.)  

However, since the molecule is very similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (0.18) but with one less chlorine, I would adjust downward slightly.  

**Final predicted value: 0.10**  

(But given the examples, the most plausible answer based on the data is **0.18**, as the slight difference in chlorination may not significantly affect the property in this case.)  

For consistency with the provided examples, the best match is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.18**  

(Since the given examples with similar chlorinated biphenyls are 0.18, I’ll stick with that.)  

### Final Answer:  
**0.18**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.26
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and my knowledge of molecular structures and their properties, I can predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with no polar functional groups** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, or simple aromatic rings) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CCCCCCCC** (linear alkane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (alkene) has a value of **-0.26**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (alkyl-substituted benzene) has a value of **-0.78**.

2. **Molecules with double bonds (alkenes)** tend to have slightly more negative values than alkanes but still close to zero unless conjugated or part of a larger polar system.

3. **Branching** (e.g., **CC=C(C)C**) does not significantly alter the property compared to linear alkenes, as seen in the examples.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
This is a branched alkene (isoprene) with no polar functional groups. Comparing it to similar structures:
- **CCCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene) has a value of **-0.26**.
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a value of **0.0**.
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (branched aromatic) has a value of **-0.78**.

Given that **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene, its value should be slightly more negative than a branched alkane but less negative than a branched aromatic. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and -0.4**. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC=C(C)C** is **-0.3**. 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples for simple, non-polar alkenes with minor branching.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.58
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for the prediction of **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):

1. **Simple, small, and symmetric molecules** with minimal polarity or functional groups tend to have property values close to **0.0** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1` = 0.0, `CCC(C)C` = 0.0).  
2. **Halogenated small molecules** (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` = 0.9, `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` = 2.06) tend to have **positive values**, but their magnitude increases with size and number of halogens.  
3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)** is a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorines but lacks the complexity or extreme polarity of larger polyhalogenated compounds.  

### Predicted property value:  
**0.4**  

This estimate balances its small size (pushing toward 0) with the presence of halogens (pushing slightly positive). It is notably lower than larger polyhalogenated examples but higher than non-halogenated small molecules.  

*(Note: If the property is logP, this aligns roughly with dichloromethane's experimental logP ~0.93, but the training examples suggest the model may be offset. Given the variability in the data, 0.4 is a reasonable interpolation.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.1100000000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the patterns observed, the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is very similar to the example **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, which has a property value of **-0.11**. 

The only difference between the two molecules is the position of one chlorine atom (the given molecule has the chlorines in positions 2, 4, and 5, while the example has them in positions 2, 3, and 5). Since the substitution pattern is very similar and the overall electronic and steric effects are likely comparable, the property value should be close to the example. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is:  
**-0.11**

Iteration: 96
SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -3.3299999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Given Molecule:
1. **Multiple Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**: 
   - Methoxy groups (`OC`), hydroxyl groups (`O`), and ether linkages (`COC`) are present. These are polar and often contribute negatively to the property value (as seen in examples like `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` with -1.06 or `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with -1.58).
   - A lactone (cyclic ester) is present (`COC2=O`), which is also polar.

2. **Polycyclic and Aromatic Systems**: 
   - The molecule contains fused aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...c67`) and polycyclic systems. Aromatic systems with polar substituents tend to lower the property value (e.g., `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` has -2.74).

3. **Sugar-like Substituents**: 
   - The structure includes sugar-like moieties (`OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`). These are highly polar and hydrophilic, similar to `OCC1OC(...)C1O` (which has -0.44), but more complex.

4. **Overall Polarity and Size**: 
   - The molecule is large and highly polar due to the abundance of oxygen atoms and conjugated systems. Large polar molecules in the examples (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` with -1.74 or `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` with -3.15) have strongly negative property values.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are large, oxygen-rich, polycyclic molecules like:
  - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (-3.15)
  - `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` (-1.74)
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (-0.44)
- The given molecule is even more complex and polar than these, suggesting a more negative value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the high polarity, aromaticity, and structural complexity, the predicted property value is:  
**-2.50**  

This is a conservative estimate, balancing the contributions of the polar groups (which would push the value lower) and the size (which might moderate the effect slightly compared to the most extreme examples like -3.15). 

### Confidence:
- High confidence that the value is between -2.0 and -3.0.
- The exact value is harder to pin down without more examples of similarly large, polyoxygenated polycyclic molecules, but -2.50 is a reasonable interpolation. 

Let me know if you'd like further refinement!

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with sulfur and nitrogen) fused to a **pyrimidine-like** fragment (with carbonyl (=O) and amino (NH) groups. This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic systems in the examples (e.g., `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` with a value of -1.78).
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **thioether (S-methyl)** group attached to the ring.
   - A **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - A **carbonyl (=O)** and **NH** group in the ring, contributing to polarity and hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with **heterocycles containing N and O** (e.g., `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) tend to have negative values (-1.78). 
- The presence of **S-methyl (thioether)** is somewhat analogous to `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` (-1.16), but the latter is less polar.
- The **tert-butyl group** adds hydrophobicity, similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (-1.21), which also has a bulky group and heterocycle.
- The **carbonyl and NH** in the ring resemble `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (-1.32), which has a similar polar profile.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- Heterocycles with polar groups (NH, =O) and sulfur tend to have values in the **-1.2 to -1.8 range**.
- Bulky alkyl groups (like tert-butyl) slightly reduce the magnitude (make it less negative) due to increased hydrophobicity.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with values around **-1.2 to -1.5**, and balancing the polar vs. hydrophobic contributions, a reasonable prediction is:

**-1.21**  

This aligns closely with `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (-1.21), which shares key features (heterocycle, S, bulky alkyl).

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.31
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the molecular structure of **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an ester group (**CCOC(=O)**) attached to a benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**). 
2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** has a property value of **-1.88**. This molecule is more complex but shares an ester group and aromatic ring.
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (an ester) has a value of **-0.53**.
   - **CCCCC(=O)OCC** (another ester) also has **-0.53**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** (contains multiple carbonyls) has **-1.39**.
   - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (aromatic with carbonyls) has **-1.7**.

3. **Simpler Esters vs. Aromatic Esters**:
   - Aliphatic esters (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) tend to have values around **-0.53**.
   - Aromatic esters or those with additional polar groups tend to have more negative values (e.g., **-1.7** to **-1.88**).

4. **This Molecule**:  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an aromatic ester (ethyl benzoate). It lacks additional polar groups (like **NO2**, **NH2**, or **OH**) but has the conjugated aromatic ring, which may slightly lower the value compared to purely aliphatic esters.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the examples, the most reasonable prediction for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.53** (similar to other simple aromatic esters or esters with moderate polarity).  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Non-polar/aliphatic structures (e.g., **CC**) have **0.0**.
- Simple esters (aliphatic) are around **-0.53**.
- Aromatic esters with no additional polar groups fall in the same range (**-0.53** to **-0.7**).  

Thus, the answer is:  
**-0.53**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.48
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a property value of **0.73**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (a polychlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.69**.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **-0.82**.
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (a brominated heterocycle) has a value of **-0.84**.

   Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to introduce variability, but simple alkyl halides like **CI** have positive values, while larger/bulkier halogenated structures tend to have negative values.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a value of **-0.04**.
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a value of **-0.26**.
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (4-heptanone) has a value of **-0.33**.
   - **CCCCCC(=O)C** (2-heptanone) has a value of **-0.33**.

   Longer alkyl chains with no polar groups tend to have values close to zero or slightly negative. The presence of a terminal functional group (e.g., -OH, =O) slightly reduces the value.

3. **Brominated Alkyl Chains**:
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a simple linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). Comparing it to **CI** (iodomethane, 0.73) and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene, -0.82), we see that:
     - Small alkyl halides (like **CI**) have positive values.
     - Larger/bulkier halogenated molecules have negative values.
     - The bromine in **CCCCCCCBr** is terminal, similar to **CI**, but the long alkyl chain may reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CI** (small alkyl halide) has **0.73**.
- **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bulky brominated aromatic) has **-0.82**.
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has **-0.04**.

**CCCCCCCBr** is intermediate: it has a terminal bromine like **CI**, but the long alkyl chain will reduce the value. The property is likely slightly positive or close to zero. 

From the examples, the closest analog is **CI**, but with a longer chain, so the value should be lower than 0.73 but not as negative as bulky brominated aromatics. A reasonable estimate is around **0.2 to 0.4**. 

However, looking at **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (-0.82), which is a brominated aromatic, and **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (-0.84), which is a complex brominated heterocycle, simple alkyl bromides like **CCCCCCCBr** are likely less negative. 

Given that **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) is **-0.04**, and bromine is less polar than -OH but still electronegative, the value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely slightly higher than **-0.04** but less than **0.73**. 

A reasonable prediction is: **0.15**.

However, reviewing the examples again, **C=CCS(=O)SCC=C** (a sulfoxide) has **-0.02**, and **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has **-0.04**, so a simple alkyl bromide might be closer to zero. 

Given the lack of exact analogs, the safest estimate is: **0.10**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **0.10**.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CO (methanol)**, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

**Observations:**
1. **Simple alcohols** like **CCC(C)CO** and **CCC(O)CCC** have a property value of **-0.04**.
2. **Methanol (CO)** is even simpler than these alcohols, with just one carbon and an -OH group.
3. The presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) tends to make the property value slightly negative, but since methanol is very small and polar, its value should be close to zero but slightly negative.

**Comparison with similar molecules:**
- **CCC** (propane) has a value of **0.0** (no polar groups).
- **CCC(C)CO** (a branched alcohol) has **-0.04**.
- **OC1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexanol) has **-0.04**.

Since methanol is smaller but has a strong polar -OH group, its value should be slightly more negative than propane but similar to other small alcohols.

**Predicted property value for CO (methanol):**  
**-0.1**  

*(This is an estimate based on the trend observed in the dataset, where small alcohols hover around -0.04 to -0.1.)*  

However, if we strictly follow the closest analogies (like **CCC(C)CO** and **OC1CCCCCC1** at **-0.04**), the safest prediction would be:  
**-0.04**  

But given that methanol is even simpler, I’d lean toward:  
**-0.1**  

*(If the dataset strictly rounds small alcohols to -0.04, then **-0.04** is the better guess.)*  

**Final answer:** **-0.04** (to match the trend in the data for small alcohols).
