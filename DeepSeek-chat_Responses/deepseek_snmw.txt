SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.4284780731471637
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** and predict its property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chains with Polar Groups**:
   - **CCCCCC(C)C**: -0.17388476 (moderately negative)
   - **CCCCCC**: -0.11975661 (slightly negative)
   - **CCCCCCCC(C)O**: 0.52194192 (positive)
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: Similar to this but with an ester group (=O)OC.

2. **Ester-Containing Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)CC**: -0.87636672 (strongly negative)
   - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1**: 0.94413854 (strongly positive)
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC2...**: 0.32203156 (moderately positive)
   - The ester group's effect seems context-dependent (can be positive or negative).

3. **Trend for Long-Chain Esters**:
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is a long-chain ester (similar to **CCCCCCCC(C)O** but with an ester instead of alcohol).
   - The alcohol **CCCCCCCC(C)O** has a positive value (0.97437355), but esters like **CCOC(=O)CC** are strongly negative (-0.87636672).
   - The length of the chain may mitigate the negative effect of the ester.

### Prediction:
Given the long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) and the ester group, the molecule is likely to have a **moderately positive property value**, similar to **CCCCCCCC(C)O (0.52194192)** but slightly lower due to the ester's partial negative contribution. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.10764897**  
*(This matches the value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** in the examples, which is likely the intended answer.)*  

However, if this is a new molecule not in the examples, my reasoning suggests a value close to **0.1**, balancing the long hydrophobic chain and the polar ester group.  

*(Note: The molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** actually appears in the examples with a value of **0.10764897**, so the correct prediction is **0.10764897**.)*  

### Answer:
**0.10764897**

Iteration: 2
SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.8277183011013797
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule contains a fused bicyclic system with a **benzofuran-like** structure (benzene fused to a 5-membered ring containing oxygen and a carbonyl group). The 5-membered ring also includes an **NH group** and a **carbonyl (C=O)**. This is somewhat similar to the structure **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 1.01224141), which also has a 5-membered ring with carbonyl and NH groups, but with sulfur instead of oxygen. The presence of oxygen (less polarizable than sulfur) might slightly lower the property value compared to the sulfur analog.

2. **Chlorine Substituent**: The molecule has a **chlorine atom** attached to the benzene ring. From the examples, chlorine substituents can either increase or decrease the property value depending on the context. For instance:
   - **ClC=C** has a high value (0.88962531), while **ClCC** has an even higher value (0.96406893).
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** has a negative value (-0.79937395), likely due to multiple chlorines and symmetry.

3. **Carbonyl (C=O) and NH Group**: These polar groups can hydrogen bond and may reduce the property value if they dominate (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** = -0.7841747). However, in this case, the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system (lactam-like), which might mitigate this effect.

4. **Aromatic System**: The benzene ring contributes to conjugation and may increase the property value (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** = 0.24905251).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 1.01224141), but with oxygen instead of sulfur and an additional benzene ring. Oxygen is less polarizable than sulfur, so the value might be slightly lower.
- **ClC=C** (0.88962531) and **ClCC** (0.96406893) suggest that a single chlorine can lead to high values, but the presence of the polar NH and C=O may temper this.
- The fused aromatic system with a polar group is somewhat like **COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23** (property = 0.95573969), which has a high value due to conjugation and substituents.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between:
- The **chlorine substituent** (tending to increase the value),
- The **polar NH and C=O** (tending to decrease it),
- The **aromatic conjugation** (increasing it),

I predict a property value of **~0.85**. This is slightly lower than the sulfur analog (1.012) due to the less polarizable oxygen, but still high due to the chlorine and aromaticity.

### Final Answer:
**0.85** (approximate predicted value).

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.37073441891690784
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a property value of **-0.7666828**.
   - Nitro groups often contribute to negative property values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature and polarity.

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**, **CCCCCl**) tend to have moderately negative values (around -0.2 to -0.6).
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., **CC(C)C**) may slightly increase the value compared to linear chains.

3. **Combination of Nitro and Alkyl**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** has a nitro group attached to a branched alkyl group (isopropyl). This is similar to **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**, but with a simpler structure (no heterocycle or additional functional groups).

4. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely lowers the property value.
   - The isopropyl group is weakly electron-donating, which might slightly offset the nitro group's effect.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the nitro group and the branched alkyl chain, the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** should be moderately negative, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the dataset but slightly less negative due to the alkyl group's inductive effect. 

Comparing to **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (-0.7666828), which has additional complexity (heterocycle, ether), **CC(C)N(=O)=O** should have a less negative value. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.6 and -0.7**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on analogous examples). 

This aligns with the trend where nitroalkanes with simple alkyl groups have property values in this range. For example:
- **NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O** (similar nitro/amide complexity): -0.63742033  
- **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**: -0.7666828  

Thus, **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is predicted to have a property value of **-0.65**. 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is likely related to a physicochemical property influenced by polarity and functional groups.

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.024286677757619567
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple rings (steroid-like framework)**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, which often reduces the property value (e.g., see `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` with a value of 0.485 and `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` with 0.209).
2. **Polar functional groups**:
   - A hydroxyl group (`C(O)`), which can slightly increase the property (but is offset by the large hydrophobic framework).
   - A carbonyl group (`C(=O)`), which is polar but neutralized by the nonpolar environment.
   - Another carbonyl in an aldehyde-like terminal group (`C(=O)CO`), which adds some polarity.
3. **No aromatic rings**: Aromaticity tends to increase the property (e.g., see `Cc1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` with 0.846), but this molecule lacks aromaticity.
4. **Size and complexity**: Large, saturated polycyclic systems tend to have lower values (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` has 0.209).

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The closest analog is `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property = 0.209), which is also a steroid-like polycycle with carbonyl groups. The additional polar groups (`OH` and `C(=O)CO`) in the query molecule may slightly increase the property relative to this analog.
- Another similar case is `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (property = 0.245), which has polar amide/carbonyl groups but is less bulky.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar groups and a large hydrophobic framework, the property value is likely **moderately positive but lower than simpler aromatic systems**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.18** (range: 0.15 to 0.25). 

This aligns with the trend where bulky polycycles with some polarity have values in the low-positive range.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.13418296002901822
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - From the examples, aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often contribute to positive property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 0.28898863, `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` = 0.36728665).
   - The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) suggests a moderate positive contribution.

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`). 
   - Amides or similar polar groups (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` = 0.52444737, `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` = 0.9440026) tend to increase the property value, especially when conjugated with aromatic systems.

3. **Chlorine substitution**: The chlorine on the second aromatic ring (`c2ccc(Cl)cc2`) is similar to examples like `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.28898863) or `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (0.28898863), which have modest positive values.

4. **Fluorine substitution**: The fluorine substituents (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`) are analogous to `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (0.36728665), suggesting a positive but not extreme contribution.

5. **Overall polarity**: The combination of halogens and amides suggests a polar molecule with a property value in the mid-to-high positive range.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (0.52444737): Single amide + aromatic ring.
- `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` (0.9440026): Amide-like group + aromatic ring.
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.28898863): Dichloroaromatic.
- `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (0.36728665): Trifluoromethyl aromatic.

Given that our molecule has **two amides + two aromatic rings + multiple halogens**, the property value should be higher than the simpler examples but not as extreme as some of the highly halogenated cases (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = 1.00726406).

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**, balancing the contributions from the amides and halogens. 

**Final Prediction: 0.75** (specific value could range between 0.7 and 0.8 based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.8757329100346165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with **long hydrocarbon chains** (e.g., `CCCCCC(O)CC`, `CCCCCC1CCCC1`) tend to have **high positive values** (e.g., 0.974, 0.800).
   - Molecules with **polar groups** (e.g., -OH, -F, -Cl, -CN, -NO₂) or **aromatic rings** often have **lower or negative values**.
   - **Ethers** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC`, `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC`) show mixed trends but generally lean toward **moderate or negative values** unless balanced by hydrophobic chains.

2. **Branching vs. Linearity**:
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`) tend to have **higher values** (0.908) than linear chains with polar groups.
   - Ethers with branching (e.g., `CCCOC(C)C`) may have slightly lower values than pure hydrocarbons due to the oxygen's polarity.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate): **-0.876** (due to ester group).
   - `CCCCCO` (pentanol): **-0.292** (polar -OH reduces value).
   - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol): **0.0038** (branching offsets polarity slightly).
   - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (branched alcohol): **0.0038** (same as above).

---

### Analysis of **CCCOC(C)C**:
- **Structure**: Propyl isopropyl ether (hydrocarbon chain + branched ether).
- **Features**:
  - Moderate hydrocarbon content (6 carbons, but not fully linear).
  - One polar oxygen (ether), but no highly polar groups like -OH or -F.
  - Branching (isopropyl group) may slightly increase the property value compared to linear ethers.
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (property = 0.0038) but with an ether instead of alcohol (less polar).
  - Similar to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (property = 0.0038) but with less polarity.
  - Ethers like `CCOC(=O)CC` are more polar (ester) and have lower values (-0.876), but **CCCOC(C)C** is less polar.

---

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of moderate hydrophobicity (branched hydrocarbon) and low polarity (ether), the predicted value should be **slightly positive but close to neutral**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property = 0.12**

---

### Rationale:
- The ether oxygen introduces slight polarity, but the branched hydrocarbon chain offsets it.
- The value is higher than alcohols (e.g., `CCCCCO` = -0.292) but lower than pure hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCC1CCCC1` = 0.800).
- Closest analog: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (0.0038), but with less polarity, so adjusted upward.  

Thus, **0.12** is a plausible prediction.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.9796812532572617
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, halogenation (Cl, Br, F), aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitriles, ethers), and overall molecular complexity. 

The molecule in question is:  
**CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**  

### Key observations about this molecule:  
1. **Halogenation**: Contains a **bromine (Br)** atom, which is electronegative and often contributes negatively to the property (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of `-0.00448868`, while `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has `0.28898863`).  
2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: Two carbonyl groups are present, which can increase polarity but may not always dominate the property.  
3. **Heterocyclic aromatic ring**: A pyrimidine-like structure with nitrogen and carbonyl groups, which could contribute to intermediate values (similar to other heterocycles like `Nc1nccs1` with `-0.88735625` or `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` with `0.96903968`).  
4. **Alkyl group (CCC(C))**: A branched alkyl chain, which tends to reduce the property (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` has `-0.11975661`).  

### Comparison to similar molecules:  
- **Br-containing**: `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of `0.1338206`.  
- **Heterocyclic + carbonyls**: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has `0.2451989`.  
- **Mixed contributions**: The presence of Br and carbonyls may balance out, but the alkyl group pulls the value down slightly.  

### Predicted value:  
Given the competing effects (Br pulling slightly negative, carbonyls and heterocycle pulling slightly positive, alkyl group reducing the value), the property is likely in the **low-to-mid positive range**.  

**Predicted property value: `0.25`** (approximate, likely between `0.1` and `0.4`).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the given data.)*

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.3528903530104445
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can infer the following trends to predict the property:

1. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.8238). 
   - Simpler aromatic systems (e.g., **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C**) also have negative values but less extreme (e.g., -0.5098).  
   - Biphenyl is a conjugated aromatic system but less extended than large polycyclics, so its value should be less negative.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) often increase the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1** has +0.8319).  
   - Biphenyl has no substituents, so no strong electron-withdrawing/donating effects are present.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (tetralin, partially saturated biphenyl) has a high value (+1.0081), but this is likely due to the aliphatic component.  
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a nitrogen-substituted polycyclic aromatic) has -0.3118, suggesting biphenyl (no nitrogen) might be slightly more negative.  
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted biphenyl-like) has -0.5098, which is a reasonable anchor.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Biphenyl is fully aromatic but lacks substituents or extended conjugation beyond two rings. Its value should be moderately negative but not as extreme as large polycyclics.  
   - A reasonable estimate is **-0.35 to -0.55**, closer to the methyl-substituted biphenyl example.

**Final predicted property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2): -0.45**  
*(This is an educated interpolation based on the given data trends.)*

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.4573837971629774
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol) in the context of the training data:

### Key observations from the training data:
1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C`, `CCC1CCCCC1`) tend to have small-magnitude values, either slightly positive or negative.
2. **Polar or functionalized alkanes** (e.g., `CC(O)C(C)(C)C`, `CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`) tend to have negative values, especially if they contain electronegative atoms (O, N, Cl, etc.).
3. **Sulfur-containing compounds** in the training data:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` has a **positive value (0.828)**.
   - `CCc1cccc(C)c1N(C(C)COC)C(=O)CCl` (contains S indirectly) has a **negative value (-0.262)**.
   - `COCCCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1` has a **positive value (0.773)**.
   - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a **positive value (0.301)**.
   - `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` has a **positive value (0.678)**.
   - Thiols (like `CCCCS`) are not explicitly in the training data, but sulfur tends to contribute to positive values unless heavily outweighed by other polar/electronegative groups.

4. **CCCCS** is a simple aliphatic thiol with no other functional groups. The sulfur atom introduces moderate polarity but is not as electronegative as oxygen or nitrogen.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple alkanes are near zero.
- Sulfur-containing compounds in the training data tend to have **positive values** (unless counteracted by other groups).
- `CCCCS` has no strongly electronegative or aromatic features to pull the value negative.

A reasonable estimate would be a **small to moderate positive value**, similar to other sulfur-containing aliphatic compounds in the training data (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1` at **0.301** or `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` at **0.678**).

### Final predicted property value for `CCCCS`:
**0.45** (approximate, based on trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.003829693380572501
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O)**:
   - Molecules with an **-OH** group (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC` has a value of **0.00382969**) tend to have values close to zero or slightly positive.
   - Ethers (e.g., `CCCCOC` has a value of **-0.29227969**) tend to have negative values, but the presence of branching can influence this.

2. **Branching/Alkyl Groups**:
   - Highly branched alkanes (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C` has a value of **-0.11975661**) tend to have slightly negative values.
   - Branched alcohols (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O` has a value of **-0.87573291**) can have more negative values, but this depends on the exact structure.

3. **Combination of -OH and Branching**:
   - The molecule `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (similar to our target but with an -OH instead of -CO) has a value of **0.00382969**.
   - The molecule `CC(C)CC(C)O` (branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.87573291**, but this is more highly branched than our target.

### Target Molecule: **CCCC(C)(C)CO**
- This is a **branched primary alcohol** with a **tert-butyl-like group (C)(C)** and a **linear butyl chain (CCCC)**.
- The presence of the **-OH group** suggests a value around zero or slightly positive, but the branching (tert-butyl) may push it slightly negative.
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (similar but with -OH on a tertiary carbon): **0.00382969**.
  - `CC(C)CC(C)O` (more branched): **-0.87573291**.
  - `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` (cyclic and branched): **-0.51275636**.

Given that our target is less branched than `CC(C)CC(C)O` but more branched than `CCCC(C)(O)CC`, a reasonable estimate would be between these two values, closer to the less branched example.

### Predicted Property Value:
A good estimate for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is **-0.25**. 

This accounts for:
- The **-OH group** (which tends to pull the value toward zero or slightly positive).
- The **branching (C)(C)** (which tends to make the value more negative).
- The **linear butyl chain** (which has minimal impact).

Thus, the predicted property value is approximately **-0.25**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.6763729529176076
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, **c1ccccc1**) have property values around **0.585**.
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to have higher values. For example:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.509**.
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex fused aromatic) has a value of **0.846**.
   - The presence of methyl groups (**C** or **Cc**) on aromatic systems can slightly lower the value (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** has **0.363**).

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, **NO2**) tend to increase the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** has **0.601**).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, **C**) tend to decrease the value (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1** has a lower value than benzene alone).

3. **Fused Rings vs. Simple Rings**:
   - Fused aromatic systems with more rings (e.g., **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**) have higher values than simpler fused systems (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, which is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (methyl group on one benzene ring of naphthalene). 

- Compare to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene with an additional methyl), which has a value of **-0.509**.
- The target has one fewer methyl group, so the value should be slightly higher (less negative/more positive) than **-0.509**.
- Simple naphthalene (no substituents) would likely have a value closer to benzene (**0.585**) but adjusted for the fused ring system (higher).
- The closest analog in the examples is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (**-0.509**), but with one less methyl, the value should be less negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends, the property for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is likely slightly higher than **-0.509** but still negative due to the methyl group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.35** (approximately between -0.509 and 0). 

However, looking at other examples like **c1ccccc1** (0.585) and **Cc1ccccc1** (likely lower but not provided), the value might be closer to **0.2**. Given the ambiguity, the most consistent estimate based on fused-ring systems with methyl substituents is:

**Final predicted value: -0.25** (balancing the effects of the methyl group and the fused aromatic system). 

But reviewing the examples again, **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** is -0.509, and removing one methyl would increase the value. Thus, a better estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.20** (between -0.509 and 0.585). 

Given the data, the most plausible answer is:

**-0.20** (approximate). 

However, the exact value is uncertain without more examples. If forced to pick from the trends, **-0.20** is reasonable. 

(Note: The true value might differ, but this is the best estimate given the limited examples.) 

**Final answer: -0.20** (approximate). 

---

**Correction**: After re-evaluating, the closest analog is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (-0.509), and the target has one less methyl, so the value should be less negative. A better estimate is **-0.30**. 

**Final revised prediction: -0.30**. 

(But this is still approximate; the true value could vary.) 

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted value: -0.30**. 

---

**Final Answer: -0.30** (based on closest analogs in the data).

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.6746061633333544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.06215454**.  
   - The presence of the hydantoin core suggests a moderately polar, hydrogen-bonding moiety, which may contribute to a property value in the low-to-mid range (near 0).

2. **Substituents**:  
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **bulky alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **terminal alkene (CC=C)**.  
   - The alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) adds hydrophobicity, while the alkene (CC=C) introduces slight polarity but is less polar than an alcohol or halogen.  

3. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = 0.062): This is very similar but has a smaller substituent (just **CC=C**).  
   - **CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C** (property = 0.971): This is a purely hydrophobic alkene with no polar groups, so its high value is likely due to strong lipophilicity.  
   - **C1CCC=CC1** (property = 0.246): A simple cycloalkene, less polar than our molecule.  

   Our molecule has **more polar groups (hydantoin)** than **C1CCC=CC1** but **less hydrophobicity** than **CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C**.  

4. **Expected Property**:  
   - The hydantoin core will pull the value toward the middle (near 0), while the alkyl/alkene substituents will push it slightly higher.  
   - Given that **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** is at **0.062**, the addition of **C(C)CCC** (more hydrophobic) should increase the value modestly.  

### Predicted Property:  
A reasonable estimate is **~0.15**, balancing the polar hydantoin and the hydrophobic substituents.  

**Final Answer: 0.15**  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.3672866502707552
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, sulfonamides)** tend to **lower the property value**, especially when they are strongly electron-withdrawing. For example:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: -0.6648  
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: -0.8838  
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.6712  

2. **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., CF₃, halogens) generally have **lower values** compared to simple alkylbenzenes (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1CC**: 1.0074).  

3. **Fluorine substitution** (especially **CF₃**) is **strongly electron-withdrawing**, which likely reduces the property value significantly.  

4. Comparing with similar structures:  
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: -0.7994 (multiple chlorines)  
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.6712 (single Br)  
   - **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has **three fluorines**, which are even more electron-withdrawing than Cl or Br.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the **CF₃ group**, I estimate the property value to be **between -0.6 and -0.8**.  

A reasonable prediction would be:  
**-0.72** (similar to heavily halogenated aromatics but slightly less negative than perchlorinated benzene).  

Thus, the predicted value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.72** (approximate).

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.1215173718617321
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar-like polyol (specifically, a derivative of glucose or a similar hexose), we can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Observations:
1. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: The molecule has multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. Similar molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property value: **0.06151497**) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly positive.
2. **Sugar-like Structures**: The cyclic polyol structure is analogous to **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is very similar to the linear polyol **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** in the dataset.
3. **Trend**: Molecules with many -OH groups and no strongly hydrophobic or aromatic components tend to have property values in the range of **0.0 to 0.2**.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (0.06151497)** and the cyclic structure (which may slightly reduce flexibility but not drastically change the property), the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is likely slightly higher due to the constrained ring system.

**Predicted property value: 0.08 ± 0.02**  
*(Specific prediction: 0.085)*  

This aligns with the trend observed for highly polar, hydrogen-bonding molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 0.7468797924028779
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (e.g., **CCC4C2CCC1...**), similar to some of the examples like:
   - **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property = -0.73706547)
   - **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 0.15561814)

2. **Functional groups**:
   - Two **acetyl (C(=O)C)** groups.
   - Two **hydroxyl (O)** groups attached to the ring system.
   - A **conjugated carbonyl (C=O)** in one of the rings.

3. **Polarity and size**: The molecule is large and has polar groups (OH, C=O), which may influence its property.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule most closely resembles **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 0.15561814), which also has a steroid core with carbonyl groups and an ester linkage. However, our molecule has additional hydroxyl groups and acetyl substituents, which could increase polarity or hydrogen bonding potential.
- Another similar example is **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property = -0.73706547), which has fewer substituents but shares the steroid core and carbonyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarities, the property value is likely to fall between these two examples. The additional hydroxyl groups and acetyl substituents in our molecule may push the property toward a slightly more positive value than **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (0.15561814), but not as negative as **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (-0.73706547).

### Final predicted property value:
**0.12** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar structures). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property depends on subtle structural effects not fully captured by the examples. For a precise prediction, computational modeling or additional similar examples would be needed.

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -0.7305885659270808
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, halogens), branching, and overall polarity. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, a hydroxyl group, and a carbonyl group. 

Breaking it down:
1. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Present in many of the examples, often associated with positive property values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has 0.920, `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` has 0.709).
2. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: Also common in examples with positive values (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` has 1.011).
3. **Polycyclic structure**: Molecules with fused rings (e.g., `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has 0.676, `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` is similar but more complex).
4. **Polarity and size**: Larger, more polar molecules tend to have higher values unless heavily halogenated (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has -0.858 due to many halogens).

Given the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups and the polycyclic nature, this molecule is likely to have a **positive property value** in the range of **0.7 to 1.0**. 

Comparing to the most structurally similar example:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` has a value of **0.70953259**, which is very close in structure (steroid-like, hydroxyl, aromaticity). 
- The additional carbonyl group in the query molecule may slightly increase the value.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` is approximately **0.75**. 

For precision, I would estimate:  
**Predicted property value: 0.78** (rounded to two decimal places based on trends in the data).

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.12088982566912804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CC(=O)N-)**: Present in the molecule, similar to amide-containing examples like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 1.012) or `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 0.956). These suggest amides can contribute to higher property values.
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the aromatic ring. Examples with nitro groups include `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (property = 0.601) and `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = -0.262). The nitro group's effect seems context-dependent (e.g., aromatic vs. aliphatic, substitution pattern).
   - **Aromatic ring with para-substitution**: The nitro and acetamide groups are para to each other, which may influence polarity/electronic effects.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene): 0.601.
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitroanisole): -0.262.
   - `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (amide + nitro): 0.956.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (amide, no nitro): 1.012.

   The presence of both an amide and a nitro group suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing (nitro) and electron-donating (amide NH) effects, likely leading to a moderate-high property value.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is polar due to the amide and nitro groups but not excessively large (smaller than some high-value examples like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1`).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of amide (tending to increase the property) and nitro (variable effect), and comparing to similar structures, the property value is likely in the **0.6 to 0.9 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar examples). 

This balances the nitrobenzene (0.601) and higher amide-containing examples (0.956, 1.012), accounting for the para-substitution and polarity.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.73598876193179
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a relatively polar and bulky group. Similar polar/charged groups in the examples (e.g., carboxylates, sulfonamides) tend to lower the property value (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OC** has -0.876, **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has -0.873).  
   - The presence of sulfur (S) may further reduce the value (e.g., **CSSC** has -0.719).

2. **Aromatic System with Chlorine (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent (electron-withdrawing) and a lactam-like structure (c(=O)o) suggests moderate polarity. 
   - Chlorinated aromatics in the examples have varying values: **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (-0.843), **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (-0.004), **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.289). The property seems to depend on the number of Cl atoms and additional functional groups.

3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as strongly negative as carboxylates. Examples like **CCCO** (0.761) and **CCCCCCCO** (0.004) suggest alkoxy groups can have neutral to slightly positive contributions unless paired with strongly negative groups.

4. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is large and has mixed polar/nonpolar regions. Large polar molecules in the examples (e.g., steroids, complex heterocycles) often have negative values (e.g., **-0.275 to -0.873**).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog might be **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (-0.873), which has a polar sulfonamide-like group and aromatic systems. Our molecule has a phosphorothioate (even more polar than sulfonamide) and a chlorinated aromatic system, suggesting a similarly negative value.
- The presence of Cl and S could push the value slightly higher (less negative) than -0.873, but the phosphorothioate's polarity likely dominates.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than -0.873 but still strongly influenced by the phosphorothioate group. A plausible prediction is:  
**-0.75 ± 0.05** (e.g., **-0.72 to -0.78**).  

For specificity, we'll select:  
**Predicted property value: -0.76**  

This aligns with the trend of large, polar molecules with sulfur and halogen substituents in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.29227969420733435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (presence of -OH group)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: 0.97437355  
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.84405744  
   - **CCCCC(CC)CO**: 0.97437355  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: 0.06151497  
   - **CC1CC2C3CC(F)C4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: 0.09858684  

   Alcohols generally have positive property values, often in the range of ~0.5 to ~1.0, unless other functional groups or structural features significantly alter the property.

2. **Branching effects**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (less branched) has a value of 0.84405744.  
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O** (linear with one branch) has a value of 0.97437355.  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol, highly branched) would likely have a similar or slightly lower value due to increased steric hindrance but still retain the alcohol-driven positive trend.

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **CCC** (propane, no -OH): -0.55898099 (negative due to lack of polar groups).  
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): 0.84405744.  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) is structurally similar to isobutanol but with more branching. Branching might slightly reduce the property value compared to less branched alcohols, but it should still be strongly positive.

### Prediction:
Given that **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (tert-butanol), it is expected to have a high positive property value similar to other alcohols in the dataset. However, due to its high branching, the value may be slightly lower than less branched alcohols like **CC(C)CO** (0.844) but still in the same range. 

A reasonable estimate would be **~0.80**, considering the branching effect. For precision, we can interpolate between **CC(C)CO** (0.844) and highly branched polyols like **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (0.0615), but the latter is an outlier due to multiple -OH groups. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:  
**0.80** (approximate; exact value likely between 0.75 and 0.85).  

If forced to pick a specific value from the trend, **0.82** would be a balanced choice.  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 0.82**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.974593838409544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples:

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **purine-like heterocycle** with the following features:
- Contains two fused rings (similar to purine).
- Has multiple nitrogen atoms (N) and a carbonyl group (C=O).
- The presence of **NH groups** and **N in the ring** suggests potential hydrogen bonding and polarity.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = 0.93994634):
   - Similar structure: fused ring with N, C=O, and NH.
   - The presence of fluorine (F) may slightly increase the property, but the core structure is similar.
2. **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = -0.43596555):
   - Simpler fused ring with N, C=O, and NH, but lacks the additional fused ring complexity.
3. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (property = 0.62771128):
   - Contains multiple C=O and NH groups, but not fused aromatic rings.

### Key Observations:
- Fused aromatic rings with multiple N and C=O groups tend to have **higher property values** (e.g., 0.9399 for Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F).
- The absence of halogens (Cl, F, Br) or bulky alkyl groups may reduce the property slightly compared to halogenated examples.
- The molecule is more similar to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** but without the fluorine.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** but with slightly less electronegative influence (no F), the property should be **slightly lower** than 0.9399 but still relatively high due to the fused ring and polar groups.

**Final Prediction:**  
**0.85** (rounded from an estimated range of 0.84–0.86 based on the examples).  

This aligns with the trend that fused N-heterocycles with C=O and NH groups have high property values, but not as extreme as heavily halogenated molecules (e.g., CCl4-like structures).

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.28854659590023657
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. Let's analyze the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate, with the structure CH₃-CO-O-CH(CH₃)₂):

1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - It contains an ester group (**COO**), which is polar and often associated with intermediate property values (neither very high nor very low).
   - The presence of branched alkyl groups (isopropyl) may reduce polarity slightly compared to simpler esters like ethyl acetate.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a property value of **0.76069991**, which is relatively high due to the hydroxyl group's polarity.
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester) has a value of **0.0600531**, showing that esters with additional polar groups can have moderate values.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ester) has a value of **0.15561814**, suggesting bulkier esters have lower values than simple esters.
   - **CCOC=C** (an enol ether) has a high value of **0.93339127**, but this is likely due to the double bond's contribution rather than being a direct ester comparison.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Methyl acetate is a simple ester, but the branched isopropyl group reduces its polarity compared to linear esters. 
   - Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than isopropanol's value but higher than bulky esters. 

**Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O: ~0.25** (intermediate polarity, influenced by the ester and branching). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.296809554826692
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (i.e., **N,N'-diphenylurea**). Ureas often exhibit moderate polarity due to the carbonyl (C=O) and NH groups.
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2) are present, contributing to hydrophobicity but also capable of π-π interactions.
3. **Polarity**: The C=O and NH groups introduce hydrogen-bonding capacity, which can lower the property value (as seen in polar molecules like alcohols or amines in the examples).
4. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, which may stabilize it and reduce extreme values.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Polar/Aromatic Molecules**: 
  - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (phenol + Cl) has a high value (0.920), but the hydroxyl group is more polar than the urea here.
  - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (nicotinamide) has a value of 0.524, similar to other polar aromatics.
  - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (toluidine) has a low value (-0.700) due to the amine group.
- **Urea/Carbamate-like Structures**: 
  - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (carbamate) has -0.204.
  - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic urea) has 0.336.

### Prediction:
The **N,N'-diphenylurea** is less polar than phenol but more polar than simple hydrocarbons. It lacks strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups (like NO₂ or OH), so the value should be moderate. Given the examples:
- Similar to **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (-0.204) but with two phenyl rings (increasing hydrophobicity slightly), we might expect a slightly higher value.
- The symmetric urea core may stabilize the property near neutral.

**Predicted Property Value: 0.15**  
*(This is a reasoned estimate based on the examples, likely in the range of 0.1 to 0.3.)* 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. The value is likely closer to neutral (0) with a slight positive bias due to the aromatic rings.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.8873062647528247
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, functional groups, and overall polarity. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused benzene rings.

From the examples:
- Aromatic systems with no polar functional groups (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1`: -0.85154749, `Sc1ccccc1`: -0.50572233) tend to have negative property values, likely reflecting low polarity or hydrophobicity.
- Fluorene is structurally similar to these aromatic systems but has a slightly more rigid and conjugated framework due to the central five-membered ring.

Comparing to the provided data:
- The closest analog is `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH), which has a value of **-0.85154749**.
- Fluorene is smaller but similarly aromatic, so its value should be slightly less negative (closer to zero) due to reduced size/conjugation.

**Predicted property value for fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13): ~ -0.75**  
*(Estimated range: -0.80 to -0.70, based on the trend of aromatic systems in the examples.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.11668174015182384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: An electron-donating amino group on the phenyl ring.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The sulfonyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, while the amino group on the phenyl ring is electron-donating. This creates a push-pull electronic effect.
   - The guanidine group is highly polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.

3. **Comparison with Given Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonyl groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**, property = -0.87394595) tend to have negative values, but this is offset by the presence of electron-donating groups.
   - Molecules with amino groups on aromatic rings (e.g., **NNc1ccccc1**, property = -0.64311952) also tend to have negative values, but the sulfonyl group here may counteract this.
   - The guanidine-like group is similar to **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.12069477), which has a slightly positive value due to its polar nature.

4. **Overall Trend**:
   - The combination of polar groups (sulfonyl, guanidine, and amino) suggests a balanced polarity, likely leading to a property value close to zero but slightly positive due to the strong electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above analysis, the predicted property value for **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is approximately:

**0.15**  

*(This is an estimate based on the structural features and trends observed in the provided examples. The actual value may vary slightly depending on finer details of the molecular interactions.)*

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9400288811884243
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, ethers, alcohols, and alkyl chains). The property values range from negative (e.g., highly halogenated or polar molecules) to positive (e.g., long alkyl chains or less polar aromatic systems).

### Analysis of the target molecule:  
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**  

1. **Functional Groups**:  
   - Two nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**): These are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which typically reduce the property value (see examples like `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` with 0.861, but note the hydroxyl offsets it).  
   - Trifluoromethyl (**C(F)(F)F**): Highly electronegative, likely reducing the property (similar to `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl` at -0.615).  
   - Tertiary amine (**CCN(CC(C)=C)**): Slightly polar but less impactful than nitro/CF3.  
   - Alkene (**CC(C)=C**): Minimal effect.  

2. **Aromatic System**:  
   - Disubstituted benzene with strong electron-withdrawing groups (nitro + CF3), which likely destabilizes aromaticity and reduces the property.  

3. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl` (-0.615): Two aromatic rings with halogens.  
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (-0.871): Polar amide + two chlorines.  
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (0.861): Nitro + hydroxyl (hydroxy may counteract nitro).  

The target molecule has **two nitro groups + CF3**, which are more electron-withdrawing than most examples. This suggests a **negative property value**, likely between -0.6 and -0.9.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.75** (approximate, considering the combined effects of nitro and CF3 groups).  

This aligns with trends where highly polar/electron-withdrawing substituents yield lower values.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.28854659590023657
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given examples:
1. **Functional groups and polarity**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N, -Cl) tend to have a wide range of property values, from negative to positive.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCCCCCC1, CCCCCCC(C)O) tend to have small positive or negative values.
   - Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1) and amides often have negative or near-zero values.

2. **Oxygen-containing groups**:
   - Alcohols (e.g., CCCCCO, OC1CCCCCC1) have property values ranging from positive (0.974 for CCCCCO) to negative (-0.177 for OC1CCCCCC1).
   - Carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes/ketones (e.g., CCC=O, O=C1CCCCC1) tend to have positive values (0.933 for CCC=O) or strongly negative values (-0.863 for O=C1CCCCC1), depending on the context.

3. **Ethers**:
   - Ethers (e.g., CC(C)SC(C)C) have small positive values (0.189 for CC(C)SC(C)C).
   - The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester (methyl acetate-like structure with a tert-butyl group), and esters in the examples have varied values:
     - CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1: -0.886 (negative due to the aromatic amine)
     - CCCCCOC(=O)C: 0.973 (positive, likely due to the long alkyl chain).

4. **Branching**:
   - Branched molecules (e.g., CCC(C)(C)O) tend to have slightly negative values (-0.292 for CCC(C)(C)O).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is an ester with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formyl group (C=O). 
- Similar molecules:
  - CC(=O)N: 0.693 (amide, positive)
  - CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC: 0.562 (thioester-like, positive)
  - CC(C)SC(C)C: 0.189 (thioether, positive but small)
- The ester group here is less polar than an amide but more polar than a simple ether. The branching (isopropyl) may slightly reduce the property value compared to linear esters.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CC(C)OC=O** is likely to have a **small positive property value**, similar to other branched esters or ethers. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.2 to 0.4**. 

Looking at the closest analogies:
- CC(C)SC(C)C: 0.189 (branched thioether)
- CC(=O)N: 0.693 (branched amide)
- CCC(C)(C)O: -0.292 (branched alcohol)

Since **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester with branching, I predict a value slightly higher than CC(C)SC(C)C but lower than CC(=O)N. 

### Final predicted value:
**0.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual property could be related to solubility, logP, or another molecular descriptor.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.5276368111337933
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a substituted phenol with the following features:
- A benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (`Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`), one at position 1 and one at position 3.
  - A hydroxyl group (`OH`) at position 4 (para to the first methyl).
- The formula is **C8H10O**, and the structure resembles a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol).

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a property value of **-0.71382269**.
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (a fused-ring phenol) has a value of **0.18115559**.
   - `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` (a dihydroxybenzene with a long alkyl chain) has a value of **0.93438542**.
   - The presence of electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl groups) on the phenol ring tends to increase the property value compared to phenol itself.

2. **Methyl Substitutions**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene-like) has a value of **-0.70033257** (no OH group).
   - `Cc1ccccc1C` (ethylbenzene-like) has a value of **0.36316148**.
   - Methyl groups generally increase the property value when combined with polar groups (e.g., OH).

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The hydroxyl group (`OH`) tends to lower the property value (as seen in phenol being negative).
   - Methyl groups (`CH3`) tend to increase the property value (as seen in alkylbenzenes being less negative or positive).
   - In the target molecule, the two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group are likely to partially offset each other's effects.

### Prediction:
Given the examples:
- Phenol (`c1ccccc1O`) is **-0.71382269**.
- Adding methyl groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`) increases the value to **0.36316148**.
- The target molecule has two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group, so the value should be between these two extremes but closer to the phenol value due to the polar OH group.

A reasonable estimate is slightly higher than phenol but still negative. From similar examples:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (dichlorobiphenyl) is **-0.61531117**.
- `O=Cc1ccccc1` (benzaldehyde) is **-0.75274169**.

The target molecule (`Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`) is less polar than benzaldehyde but more polar than xylene, so a value around **-0.5** seems plausible. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -0.55** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data's trends. The actual property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the reasoning holds for many such properties.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.2301461006407003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with this group (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl) show a wide range of property values (-0.813, -0.132, 0.767). The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) seems to influence the value, with heavier halogens (I) reducing the value and multiple Cl atoms sometimes increasing it (e.g., 0.767 for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl).
   - The substituents on the aromatic ring attached to the phosphorothioate group play a significant role.

2. **Aromatic Ring Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br) tend to lower the property value (more negative), while electron-donating groups (e.g., CH3, OCH3) tend to increase it (more positive).
   - In **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, the aromatic ring has:
     - A thioether group (**SC**), which is moderately electron-donating (similar to OCH3 but less so).
     - A methyl group (**C**), which is weakly electron-donating.
     - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl or NO2).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog in the given examples is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = 0.767), which has three Cl atoms (strongly electron-withdrawing) and still has a high positive value. 
   - Our molecule has **SC** and **CH3** instead of Cl, which are less electron-withdrawing. This suggests the property value should be lower than 0.767 but still positive due to the absence of strong electron-withdrawing effects.

4. **Other Influences**:
   - The **P(=S)** group itself seems to contribute to higher values when not counteracted by strong electron-withdrawing groups.
   - The **OCH3** groups (in COP(=S)(OC)) are electron-donating, further supporting a positive value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above analysis, the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is expected to have a **positive property value**, likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.52**  

This is based on:
- The absence of strong electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl).
- The presence of moderately electron-donating groups (SC and CH3).
- The phosphorothioate backbone, which tends to support positive values when not heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.9792472502354096
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property tends to be influenced by the following molecular features:

1. **Halogenation (Cl, Br, etc.)**: Highly halogenated molecules (especially with Cl) tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.5 to -0.9 (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has -0.88378934, and `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has -0.88570899).

2. **Aromatic systems**: Purely aromatic systems with halogens tend to have moderately negative values, while fused aromatic systems without halogens can have positive values (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` has 0.48536931).

3. **Functional groups**: Polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) can shift the property positively or negatively depending on context.

The molecule in question is:
`Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`

This is a highly chlorinated, fused aromatic system (similar to a polychlorinated biphenyl or polycyclic structure). Given the examples:
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has -0.88378934.
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has 1.00939616 (this is an outlier, possibly due to symmetry or steric effects).
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has -0.88570899.

The molecule is most similar to the first example (`Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`), with even more chlorination and a fused ring system. Chlorination typically drives the property more negative, but the fused rings might slightly offset this. 

**Predicted property value: -0.87**  
(Expected to be close to -0.88378934 or -0.88570899, but slightly less negative due to the fused ring system). 

For precision, I would estimate: **-0.872**.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.37073441891690634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values, especially when attached to aromatic rings or polar environments. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` → **0.22058349**
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` → **0.90269526** (not nitro but shows high value with polar groups)
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` → **0.85358404**
   - However, nitro groups on small aliphatic chains may not have as strong an effect.

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC` → **-0.55898099**, `CC` → **-0.77583225**) tend to have negative property values unless functionalized with polar or electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Combination of Aliphatic and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is a small aliphatic chain (propyl) with a nitro group attached. 
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - `CC(C)CCOC=O` → **-0.00018234** (aliphatic with polar group)
     - `Nc1nc[nH]n1` → **0.07061851** (small polar heterocycle)
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which likely increases the property value compared to plain alkanes, but the aliphatic chain may dampen the effect.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Pure aliphatic chains have negative values.
- Nitro groups increase the value, but the effect is weaker on small aliphatic chains (compared to aromatic systems).
- The molecule is small (3-carbon chain + NO2), so the nitro group's influence is somewhat limited.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly positive, similar to `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (0.07061851) or `CC(C)CCOC=O` (-0.00018234), but likely higher due to the nitro group's stronger polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.15** (approximate, based on the trends observed). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value could vary if the property is sensitive to specific structural features not fully captured here.)

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5428923381521296
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with halogen substitutions (especially Cl or Br) on aromatic rings tend to have positive property values. For example:
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: **0.80166258**
     - COc1cccc(Cl)c1: **0.64919304**
     - BrC(Br)Br: **0.51897101**
     - c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12: **0.70831174**
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) seems to increase the property value, with Br having a slightly stronger effect than Cl.

2. **Fluorine (F) Substitution**:
   - The only example with F substitution is:
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1: **-0.26411071**
   - However, this molecule also has an amide group (CC(=O)N), which likely lowers the property value. Fluorine alone may not have as strong an effect as Cl or Br.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Multiple Halogens**:
   - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: **-0.79937395** (this is an outlier, possibly due to the high number of Cl atoms or symmetry).
   - For simpler mono-halogenated aromatics, the values are positive.

4. **Combined Halogens (F and Br)**:
   - The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has both F and Br on the aromatic ring. Br is likely to dominate the effect due to its larger polarizability compared to F.

### Prediction:
- The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: **0.80166258**), but with F instead of Cl. Since F is less polarizable than Cl, the property value might be slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but still positive due to the Br.
- Another close analog is **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property: **0.64919304**), where the Br in **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** may compensate for the weaker effect of F compared to Cl.

### Final Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is approximately:  
**0.75** (slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 but higher than COc1cccc(Cl)c1 due to Br's stronger effect). 

### Exact Value:
After closer inspection of the examples, the most reasonable estimate is:  
**0.78** (similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 but adjusted slightly downward for F). 

However, since the Br is likely to dominate, the value could be closer to **0.80**. 

Given the data, the most precise prediction is:  
**0.79** (a compromise between the Br and F effects). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I will round to:  
**0.791**  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is:  
**0.791**

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.35625682252999546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO, halogens)** tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., `CBr: -0.754`, `NC(=O)CCl: -0.680`). 
   - Molecules with **nonpolar/aliphatic chains** or **aromatic systems without polar groups** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., `CCCCBr: 0.948`, `CCc1ccc(CC)cc1: 1.007`).

2. **Ring Systems**:
   - Saturated ring systems (e.g., cyclohexane derivatives) with **polar substituents (e.g., -OH)** often have **negative values** (e.g., `CC1CCCO1: -0.115`).
   - Steroid-like or fused ring systems with **ketones or hydroxyl groups** can vary but often lean **negative** (e.g., `CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO: -0.662`).

3. **Specific Case for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**:
   - This is a **bicyclic saturated hydrocarbon** with **one hydroxyl group (-OH)** and **two quaternary carbons (tert-butyl-like)**.
   - The presence of **-OH** suggests a negative contribution, but the **steric bulk (quaternary carbons)** may offset this slightly.
   - Similar examples:
     - `CC1CCCO1` (cyclopentane with -OH and aliphatic chain): **-0.115**
     - `CC(C)(C)CO` (tert-butyl alcohol): **-0.292**
     - `CC5(C)OC4...` (complex steroid with -OH): **-0.662**

### Prediction:
Given the **-OH group** and **saturated bicyclic structure**, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely low** (due to steric shielding of the -OH by the quaternary carbons). A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and -0.4**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples like `CC(C)(C)CO` and `CC1CCCO1`).

Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` by comparing its structural features to those in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is very similar to the last example in the dataset: `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`, which has a property value of **1.01028477**. The only difference is the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2` (and slight numbering differences in the rings). Both molecules share:
   - A `P(=S)(OCC)` group.
   - A `C(=O)c1ccccc1C=O` moiety (a phthalimide-like structure).
   - The rest of the structure is nearly identical (just a small substitution change).

2. **Impact of Substitution**: The substitution of `SC(CCl)` with `N` (or `N2` in the query molecule) is a relatively minor change. The `SC(CCl)` group is somewhat bulky and polar, while the `N` in the query molecule is less bulky but still polar. Given that the rest of the structure is identical, the property value is likely to be very close to the example.

3. **Other Examples**: Other molecules with `P(=S)` or phthalimide-like structures (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`) tend to have high property values (e.g., 1.01028477). The query molecule fits this trend.

### Prediction:
Given the high similarity to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = 1.01028477) and the minor nature of the substitution change, I predict the property for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` to be very close, likely slightly lower due to the less bulky `N` substitution. 

**Predicted property value: 0.98** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value is likely very close to the example, e.g., ~0.99-1.00). 

However, since the example with `SC(CCl)` is 1.01028477 and the query molecule is slightly less bulky, a reasonable estimate would be:

**Final predicted value: 0.995** (interpolating between the closest examples). 

But given the data, the most precise answer is to assume it is nearly identical to the example, so:

**Predicted property value: 1.005** (very close to the example). 

Given the options, I would lean toward **1.005** as the most reasonable prediction. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based purely on structural similarity and trends in the given data.) 

**Final answer: 1.005** (matching the closest example).

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.5843396864194347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core with a **1,2,4-triazole** or **pyrazine-2-one** scaffold (Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C). This is a fused heterocyclic system with a carbonyl group (=O) and two nitrogen atoms in the ring, along with a phenyl ring attached (c2ccccc2) and two methyl groups (C at positions 1 and the N-methyl).
2. **Polarity**: The carbonyl group (=O) and nitrogen atoms introduce polarity, but the methyl groups and phenyl ring add hydrophobicity.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **fused aromatic systems + polar groups** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O`, property = 0.31364763) have moderately positive values.
   - Molecules with **carbonyl groups + aromatic rings** (e.g., `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, property = 0.06608331) tend to have small positive values.
   - The presence of **two aromatic systems** (phenyl and heterocycle) and **methyl groups** suggests a balance between polarity and hydrophobicity, likely leading to a small-to-moderate positive value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = 0.31364763) but with slightly less extended conjugation, the predicted property for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** would be slightly lower but still positive.

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, based on structural analogies).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend in the provided data.)*

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.5254558332171928
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isoprene-like structure): **0.98920919** (high value)
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): **0.93177994** (high value)
   - Hydrocarbon chains without polar groups tend to have high positive values.

2. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -O-, -C=O):**
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol): **0.52388852** (moderate positive, due to multiple -OH groups)
   - **CCC(O)C(C)C** (alcohol): **-0.87573291** (negative, due to -OH)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (chlorinated aromatic): **-0.88378934** (very negative)
   - Polar or electronegative groups (especially halogens or multiple -OH) tend to lower the property value.

3. **Esters (R-COO-R'):**
   - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): **-0.37073442** (moderately negative)
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like ester): **1.00502679** (high, but complex structure dominates)
   - Esters seem to have variable values, but simple esters (like ethyl acetate analogs) tend to be slightly negative or neutral.

4. **Ethyl Hexanoate (CCCCCC(=O)OCC):**
   - This is a simple ester with a 6-carbon chain and an ethoxy group.
   - The hydrocarbon chain (hexyl) would push the value toward the positive range, but the ester group (-COO-) would moderate this.
   - Comparing to **CCOC(=O)N** (**-0.37073442**), which has a similar ethoxy group but an amide instead of a long chain, the longer hydrocarbon here would likely raise the value slightly.
   - No strongly electronegative groups (like halogens or multiple -OH) are present, so the value should not be very negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the hydrocarbon chain (positive contribution) and the ester group (slightly negative contribution), the predicted value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to other esters with hydrocarbon chains. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.25** (with uncertainty, but likely between 0.1 and 0.4 based on the examples). 

However, looking more closely at **COC=O** (methyl formate), which is a very simple ester, it has a value of **0.75796879**, suggesting esters with small alkyl groups can be higher. For ethyl hexanoate, the longer alkyl chain might reduce this slightly, but the lack of polar groups keeps it positive.

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**0.45** (closer to the ester examples with hydrocarbon dominance). 

But to be precise, considering the examples, I'll predict:  
**0.40** (a compromise between the hydrocarbon and ester contributions). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is **0.40**.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.9736716063874343
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Ester Functional Group (-COO-)**: The molecule contains an ester group, similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **0.00133464**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl salicylate), which has a property value of **-0.88745266** (but this also has an additional hydroxyl group, which likely lowers the value).

2. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples, but the substituents greatly influence the property value.

3. **Methyl vs. Ethyl Ester**: 
   - The only difference between **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) is the alkyl group (methyl vs. ethyl). 
   - The property value for ethyl benzoate is **0.00133464**, and methyl benzoate is expected to be very close since the alkyl chain length difference is minimal.

4. **Other Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2** (a more complex ester) has a value of **-0.2274763**, but this is less relevant due to additional functional groups.
   - Simple aromatic esters without polar substituents (like **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) tend to have values near zero or slightly positive.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a value of **0.00133464**, and methyl benzoate is structurally almost identical (just one carbon shorter in the ester group), the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be very similar, likely in the range of **0.0 to 0.1**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.001** (approximately the same as ethyl benzoate, with minor variation due to the shorter alkyl chain). 

This aligns with the trend that small, non-polar aromatic esters have near-neutral property values in this dataset.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.0119026587852056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugated Double Bonds or Aromaticity**:
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): 0.98920919  
     (Fully saturated cyclic hydrocarbon has a high positive value.)
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): -0.83021382  
     (Aromatic ring with a vinyl substituent has a negative value.)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon): 0.95135724  
     (Extended conjugation/aromaticity gives a high positive value.)

2. **Linear Alkenes**:
   - **CC/C=C/C** (2-pentene): 0.98920919  
     (A simple alkene with no conjugation has a high positive value.)
   - **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene) is a conjugated diene, which introduces additional electronic delocalization compared to isolated double bonds.

3. **Polar or Functionalized Molecules**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -Cl, -Br, -NO2, -OH, -C=O, -N) tend to have lower or negative values unless they are part of highly conjugated systems.

### Prediction for **C=CCC=C**:
- **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene, which means it has some electron delocalization but lacks the full aromatic stabilization seen in benzene-like systems. 
- Compared to **CC/C=C/C** (isolated double bond, value = 0.98920919), conjugation in 1,3-butadiene might slightly reduce the property value due to increased polarity/resonance effects, but it is still a hydrocarbon without heteroatoms.
- However, **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, with an aromatic ring + vinyl group) has a negative value (-0.83021382), suggesting that extended conjugation with an aromatic system lowers the value. Non-aromatic conjugation (as in 1,3-butadiene) might not lower it as much.

Given these observations, I predict the property value for **C=CCC=C** to be slightly lower than that of **CC/C=C/C** but still positive, likely in the range of **0.8 to 0.9**. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.85** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "hydrophobicity" or "electronic polarizability," this reasoning would hold. For other properties, the interpretation might differ.)

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.5189710079881134
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher property values, especially when the halogens are on a central carbon (e.g., **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **0.837** and **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a value of **1.007**).
   - The presence of **bromine (Br)** often increases the property value more than chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), as seen in **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.708)** and **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (1.007)**.

2. **Symmetry and Central Halogenation**: 
   - Molecules with symmetric halogenation around a central carbon (e.g., **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** or **C(Br)(Br)Br**) tend to have higher values. For example, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a very high value (**1.009**).

3. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a symmetric molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon, analogous to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (which has a value of **1.007**) but with even more bromine substitution.
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine or fluorine, which likely contributes to a higher property value.

### Prediction:
Given the high halogen content (three bromines) and symmetry, the property value for **BrC(Br)Br** should be **very high**, similar to or slightly higher than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (1.007)**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is **1.012**. 

(Note: This is an estimate based on the trend of increasing property values with heavier/more halogens and symmetry. The exact value may vary slightly, but it should be close to **1.0**.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.0102847672186437
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)`):** Present in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = -0.73380079). This group tends to contribute negatively to the property.
2. **Aromatic ring (`c1ccccc1`):** Common in many examples, with varying contributions depending on substituents. Here, it's part of a lactam structure.
3. **Lactam (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`):** Similar to cyclic amides in the examples (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`, property = 1.01187104). Lactams often increase the property value.
4. **Chlorinated alkyl group (`SC(CCl)`):** Chlorine substituents (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, property = -0.0333343) often reduce the property, but the effect depends on context.
5. **Ethoxy groups (`CCOP` and `OCC`):** Ether linkages (e.g., `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`, property = -0.26247976) tend to have a modest negative or neutral effect.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The phosphorothioate group is present in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = -0.73380079), but this molecule also has a more complex structure with additional polar groups.
- The lactam here is similar to `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (property = 0.74323832), which has a high positive value.
- The combination of phosphorothioate (negative contribution) and lactam (positive contribution) suggests a balancing effect.

### Predicted property:
Given the opposing contributions:
- The phosphorothioate and chlorine substituents would push the value toward the negative range.
- The lactam and aromaticity would push it toward the positive range.
- The overall structure is more complex than most examples, but the lactam's positive influence may slightly outweigh the phosphorothioate's negative effect.

**Predicted property value: `0.15`**  
*(This is an estimate based on the competing structural influences. The actual value would likely lie in the range of -0.2 to 0.3.)*

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.6346243553516802
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Amide group**: **C(=O)N** (similar to **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**, which has a value of **-0.1827559**).
2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: **c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)** (similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**, with a value of **-0.61531117**).
3. **Heterocyclic group with nitrogen and oxygen**: **n2nc(oc2=O)** (somewhat similar to **Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2**, which has a value of **0.54897355**, but this is more complex).
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group**: **C(C)(C)C** (similar to **CC(C)C**, which has a value of **0.93177994**, but this is less polar).
5. **Polar substituents**: The molecule has multiple polar groups (amide, chlorine, heterocycle), which generally reduce the property value compared to purely hydrophobic structures.

### Observations from Examples:
- Molecules with **chlorine + aromatic rings** tend to have negative values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** at **-0.61531117**).
- **Amides** (e.g., **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** at **-0.1827559**) also contribute to negative values.
- **Bulky alkyl groups** (e.g., **C(C)(C)C**) can increase the value if non-polar, but here they are counteracted by polar groups.
- **Complex heterocycles** (e.g., **Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2** at **0.54897355**) can push the value higher, but the presence of chlorine and amide likely offsets this.

### Synthesis:
The molecule is polar due to the amide, chlorine, and heterocycle, but the bulky tert-butyl group adds some hydrophobicity. Given the competing effects, the value is likely **moderately negative**, similar to other polar aromatic/heterocyclic compounds in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.45**. This balances the negative contributions from the polar groups (amide, chlorine) with the slight positive influence of the bulky alkyl group. 

**Final Answer: -0.45**

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.6822407762516904
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as:
- Presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F), which often decrease the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` = -0.85267184).
- Hydroxyl groups (`O` or `OH`), which can either increase or decrease the property depending on context (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` = 0.52388852, but `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` = -0.85267184).
- Aromatic systems, which tend to increase the property unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` = 0.61648307).
- Symmetry and multiple substitutions, which seem to amplify trends (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = -0.88570899).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**`Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`**  
- Structure: A biphenyl-like system with two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen (diphenyl ether), substituted with:
  - Two hydroxyl groups (`O` attached to aromatic rings).
  - Three chlorine atoms (two on one ring, one on the other).
- Analogous examples:
  - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (one ring, 1 OH, 2 Cl): **-0.85267184**  
  - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (one ring, 1 OH, 4 Cl): **-0.88570899**  
  - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (two rings, 2 Cl): **-0.61531117**  

The target molecule has **more Cl substitutions** than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` but fewer than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, and it has **two hydroxyl groups** (electron-donating) partially counteracting the electron-withdrawing Cl. The biphenyl ether linkage may slightly increase the property compared to single-ring systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effect of multiple Cl atoms and the biphenyl ether structure, the property value should be **negative and moderately large**, but less extreme than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` due to the second hydroxyl group.  

A reasonable estimate is between the values of `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.852) and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (-0.615).  

**Final Prediction: `-0.750`**  
(Confidence: Moderate, based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.9892091894958575
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value for the molecule **CC/C=C\C** (which is equivalent to **CC=CC** or but-2-ene) can be estimated by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset.

### Observations:
1. **CC/C=C/C** (but-2-ene, trans configuration) has a property value of **0.98920919** in the dataset.
2. The molecule **CC/C=C\C** is the cis configuration of but-2-ene, which is structurally very similar to the trans form but with slightly different steric and electronic properties due to the cis arrangement of substituents.

### Prediction:
Since the trans form has a value close to **0.989**, and the cis form is expected to have a similar but not identical value (due to minor differences in polarity or sterics), we can estimate the property for **CC/C=C\C** to be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

A reasonable prediction would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the given data. If the property is highly sensitive to stereochemistry, the value could differ more significantly.)

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.29227969420733435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate, with an ester -COO- group) has a property value of **-0.00018234**.
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (anisole-like with -O- and -OH) has a value of **0.67542176**.
   - Ethers (R-O-R') seem to have property values close to zero or slightly positive/negative, depending on other substituents.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Simple linear alkanes or ethers (e.g., **CC#C**, **CC(C)O**) tend to have moderate negative or positive values.
   - **CCCOCC** is a linear ether with no branching or polar substituents, similar to **CCOC(=O)C** but without the carbonyl group.

3. **Polarity and Electronegativity**:
   - The oxygen in **CCCOCC** introduces polarity, but without strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the effect is moderate.
   - Compare to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, property = **0.76069991**), where the -OH group is more polar than -O-.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (with an ester) has a value of **-0.00018234**.
   - **CCCOCC** is simpler, so its value might be slightly more positive than this but less than **CC(C)O**.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCCOCC** is a neutral ether with no strongly polar or functionalized groups. Its property value is likely close to zero but slightly positive due to the ether oxygen's weak polarity. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCOCC: 0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which contribute hydrophobicity and aromatic stacking interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = -0.87294468): This has a tertiary amide, phenyl rings, and a heterocycle. The property is negative due to the polar amide and aromatic systems.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property = -0.56417494): This has a tertiary amide and aliphatic rings, showing moderate negativity.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.07010338): This has two phenyl rings and a flexible linker, resulting in a near-neutral value.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Tertiary amides with phenyl rings tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.872, -0.564).
   - The tert-butyl group adds hydrophobicity, which may slightly increase the property compared to simpler amides.
   - The lack of strongly polar groups (e.g., NO2, OH, COOH) suggests the property won't be highly positive.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar amide (negative contribution) and the hydrophobic phenyl/tert-butyl groups (positive contribution), the property value is likely **moderately negative**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45**  

This aligns with similar structures in the dataset while accounting for the steric/hydrophobic effect of the tert-butyl group.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.13382059791910775
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **N-(4-bromophenyl)acetamide**, with the structure:
- An acetamide group (**CC(=O)N**) attached to a phenyl ring.
- A bromine substituent (**Br**) at the para position of the phenyl ring.

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**: Property = -0.54289234 (electron-withdrawing Br and F)
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.67123479 (Br and OH, both moderately electron-withdrawing)
   - **c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1**: Property = 0.23932446 (multiple Br atoms, less negative)
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = 0.28898863 (Cl is similar to Br but less electron-withdrawing)

   Bromine tends to reduce the property value (often negative), but the effect depends on other substituents.

2. **Amide Groups**:
   - **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = 0.9242493 (complex amide with bulky groups)
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**: Property = 0.33667075 (cyclic amide)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = -0.61160858 (amide with aromatic groups)

   Amides can have varying effects, but simple acetamides (like in the target) often correlate with mid-range or slightly negative values.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (Br, NO2, etc.) tend to lower the property value.
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (OH, OCH3) can increase or decrease depending on other substituents.

### Combining Effects:
- The target molecule has:
  - An electron-withdrawing bromine (lowers property).
  - An acetamide group (moderate effect, likely slightly negative).
  - No strong electron-donating groups to counteract the bromine.

### Similar Examples:
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.67123479 (Br + OH, similar but OH is donating).
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = 0.28898863 (less electron-withdrawing than Br).
- **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = -0.61160858 (amide + aromatics).

Given that the target has a stronger electron-withdrawing group (Br) than Cl and no donating groups like OH, its property should be more negative than **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** but similar to **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (though slightly less negative because the amide is less electron-withdrawing than OH).

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.55 to -0.65**. Averaging similar examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.62**

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 1.0074480406636237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
1. The molecule consists of an **isobutyl group (CC(C)C)** attached to a **benzene ring (c1ccccc1)**. This is a branched alkyl-substituted aromatic compound.
2. Similar molecules in the dataset:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluene with an amino group): **-0.70033257**
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not explicitly given, but close analogs are present.
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl-methyl benzene): **0.36316148**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl-methyl benzene): **1.00744804**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): **-0.83021382**
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetonitrile): **-0.85804325**

### Observations:
- **Alkyl-substituted benzenes** tend to have property values that vary with the size/branching of the alkyl group:
  - Ethyl-methyl benzene (**CCc1ccc(C)cc1**) has a moderately positive value (**0.36316148**).
  - Isopropyl-methyl benzene (**CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**) has a highly positive value (**1.00744804**).
  - Styrene (**C=Cc1ccccc1**) and phenylacetonitrile (**N#Cc1ccccc1**) have negative values, likely due to the presence of unsaturated/polar groups.
- The **isobutyl group (CC(C)C)** is bulkier than ethyl but less branched than isopropyl. Its effect is likely intermediate.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl-methyl benzene) has a value of **0.36316148**,
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl-methyl benzene) has a value of **1.00744804**,
- The isobutyl group is between ethyl and isopropyl in terms of branching/size,

the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely **between 0.36 and 1.00**, closer to the lower end due to less branching than isopropyl.

### Final Prediction:
**0.55** (approximate intermediate value based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The true value may vary if the property depends on other subtle features.)
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7527416898354674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): 0.94413854 (high positive value)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups): -0.86552303 (negative value)
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (phenol + nitro): 0.86173979 (high positive value)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (amide + chloro): 1.01215717 (very high positive value)

   Polar substituents like **-OH**, **-NO₂**, **-CONH-**, and **-Cl** seem to influence the property significantly, with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **-NO₂**) sometimes lowering the value and donating/amide groups increasing it.

2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (carbonyl in heterocycle): 0.90363041 (high positive)
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (cyclic ketone): -0.00267671 (near zero)
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (two carbonyls): 1.00502679 (very high positive)

   Carbonyls (especially conjugated) tend to increase the property value.

3. **Benzaldehyde-like structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide instead of aldehyde, plus phenol), which has a high value (0.94413854).
   - The aldehyde group (**-CHO**) is polar and conjugated with the benzene ring, likely contributing positively to the property.

4. **Simple aromatic systems**:
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthalene derivative): 0.67637295 (moderate positive)
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (fluorene): -0.88730626 (negative)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polycyclic aromatic): 0.48536931 (moderate positive)

   The property seems sensitive to aromaticity and substitution patterns.

### Prediction for **O=Cc1ccccc1**:
- The molecule is **benzaldehyde**, with a conjugated carbonyl (aldehyde) attached to a benzene ring.
- Similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.944) but without the phenol and amide, so slightly lower.
- The aldehyde is less electron-donating than an amide but still polar and conjugated, suggesting a high positive value.
- No conflicting negative contributions (e.g., nitro groups or halogens).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **~0.85**. 

This is slightly lower than the amide-phenol example (0.944) but higher than simple aromatic systems without polar groups. The conjugated aldehyde likely drives the value toward the higher end.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: 0.85** (approximate, likely between 0.80 and 0.90 based on trends).
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.6819342631199531
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - Two amide groups (`C(=O)N`), which are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
     - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
     - A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (`N=Cc1ccc(o1)`), which adds complexity and potential for hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
     - An aromatic ring (`c1ccc(o1)`), which contributes to hydrophobicity but is modified by the nitro and ether oxygen.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group and amide groups are strongly polar and electron-withdrawing, which typically reduce hydrophobicity (negative contribution to the property value).
   - The presence of multiple hydrogen bond acceptors (N, O) suggests lower lipophilicity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) tend to have negative property values (-0.287).
   - Molecules with multiple amides (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) can have positive values if balanced by hydrophobic groups, but here the nitro group dominates.
   - The heterocyclic nitrogen and aromaticity are similar to `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (property = 0.269), but the nitro group pushes the value lower.

4. **Overall Trend**:
   - The combination of nitro + amides + heterocycle suggests a moderately negative property value, likely between -0.5 and -0.7.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset (e.g., `CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C` has -0.65, and `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has -0.745). The exact value may depend on subtle steric or electronic effects, but **-0.65** is a confident prediction.
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.24941082224528272
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.65855282**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.06644878**.
   - The presence of nitrogen in aromatic systems tends to lower the property value unless additional electron-withdrawing or conjugation effects are present.

2. **Diphenylamine-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative, where two phenyl rings are connected via a nitrogen atom. This is similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but without the double-bonded nitrogen (azo group).
   - The azo group in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** introduces additional conjugation and electron-withdrawing character, leading to a slightly positive property value (**0.06644878**).
   - In **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, the nitrogen is singly bonded to both rings, which reduces conjugation and electron-withdrawing effects compared to the azo group. Thus, the property value should be lower than **0.06644878** but higher than pure aniline (**-0.65855282**) due to the additional phenyl ring.

3. **Other Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has **0.94413854**).
   - Simple diphenylamine lacks strong electron-withdrawing or donating effects, so the property value should be modest.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be slightly negative but closer to zero than aniline. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.3 and -0.1**. 

Looking at the examples, **c2ccc1[nH]ncc1c2** (indazole-like) has a value of **0.18028186**, while **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (carbazole-like) has **-0.31176267**. Diphenylamine is less conjugated than carbazole but more than aniline, so a value around **-0.2** seems plausible.

However, the closest analog is **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (**0.06644878**), and removing the azo group's double bond would reduce the property value slightly. Thus, a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.15** (approximately midway between aniline and the azo compound). 

Given the examples, a more precise estimate is **-0.12**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.12**

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.06215453870293282
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to another 5-membered ring (lactam-like structure).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically increases water solubility or interaction potential. 
   - The cyclic structure adds rigidity but doesn't introduce significant hydrophobicity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.7841747): This is a similar cyclic diamide with additional alkyl chains. The alkyl groups reduce polarity, leading to a negative value. 
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not in examples, but simpler analog): Likely more polar than the above, so less negative.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.33667075): Another cyclic diamide with alkyl substituents, but less hydrophobic than the first example, resulting in a positive value.

4. **Key Differences**:
   - The target molecule lacks extended alkyl chains (only a **CCCC1** ring), so it is less hydrophobic than **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** but more polar/rigid than some of the simpler amides. 
   - The fused ring system may slightly increase the property value compared to linear or less constrained analogs.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polarity (positive contribution) and moderate rigidity/cyclic structure (neutral to slight positive contribution), the property value is likely **positive but modest**. 

Comparing to the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.25**  

This aligns with cyclic diamides in the dataset that lack strong hydrophobic or electron-withdrawing/donating effects.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.8430242116080298
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.28898863**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **-0.65956603**, suggesting that increasing chlorine substitution on aromatic rings tends to decrease the property value (especially with bulky or polychlorinated groups).

2. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked by a single bond, with chlorine substituents). It is structurally similar to the second example above but with fewer chlorines (3 Cl atoms total, symmetrically placed).

3. **Trend**:
   - The presence of multiple chlorines on aromatic rings generally reduces the property value, but the exact value depends on the number and position of chlorines. The given molecule has fewer chlorines than the heavily chlorinated example (-0.659) but more than dichlorobenzene (0.288). 

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Dichlorobenzene (2 Cl): **0.28898863**
- Heavily chlorinated biphenyl (5 Cl): **-0.65956603**

The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (3 Cl) is intermediate in chlorine substitution. The property value is likely between these two, closer to the dichlorobenzene value but slightly lower due to the additional chlorine and biphenyl structure. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.10 to 0.20**

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**0.15** (a midpoint between the two reference values, adjusted for the structure). 

### Final Answer:
**0.15**
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 1.0074480406636237
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (which is **ethylbenzene**, a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with an ethyl substituent), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl substituents** tend to have negative property values in the dataset. For example:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene): **-0.83252304**
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine, though it has an -NH2 group): **-0.70033257**
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): **-0.70033257**

2. The presence of **ethyl (CC)** as a substituent (rather than longer alkyl chains or polar groups) suggests a moderately negative value, but less negative than longer alkyl chains like heptylbenzene.

3. The molecule lacks polar or electronegative atoms (like O, N, S, or halogens), which would otherwise push the property toward positive values (as seen in many examples).

### Prediction:
Given that ethylbenzene is less hydrophobic/lipophilic than heptylbenzene but still a nonpolar aromatic hydrocarbon, its property value should be **slightly less negative** than heptylbenzene but still in the same range. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1: -0.75**

This aligns with the trend where:
- Longer alkyl chains (e.g., heptylbenzene) → more negative (~ -0.83)
- Shorter alkyl chains (e.g., ethylbenzene) → less negative (~ -0.75)
- Polar groups → positive values.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7154870365949487
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs) and Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)**:
   - Molecules with strong EWGs (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, sulfonyl groups `S(=O)(=O)`, halogens) often have higher (more positive) property values. For example:
     - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a high value of **0.90664939**.
     - `ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` has a very high value of **0.97067596**.
   - Molecules with EDGs (e.g., alkyl groups, ethers) tend to have lower (more negative) values unless balanced by EWGs.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with EWGs attached (e.g., nitrobenzene derivatives) tend to increase the property value.
   - Aromatic rings with EDGs (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1`) have lower values (e.g., **-0.59657087**).

3. **Sulfonyl Groups (`S(=O)(=O)`)**:
   - The sulfonyl group is a strong EWG. For example:
     - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br` (contains `P=O` and halogens) has a value of **0.29691188**.
     - The presence of `S(=O)(=O)` in the query molecule suggests a higher property value.

4. **Amine Group (`Nc1...`)**:
   - The amine group (`NH2`) is an EDG, but when combined with strong EWGs (like `S(=O)(=O)`), the EWG effect often dominates. For example:
     - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a high value (**0.90664939**) despite the EDG (`NH2`).

### Analysis of the Query Molecule:
The molecule is **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (4-aminobenzenesulfonamide). It has:
- An electron-donating `NH2` group on the benzene ring.
- A strong electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`).

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitro group instead of sulfonamide) has a value of **0.90664939**.
- The sulfonamide group is similarly electron-withdrawing (possibly more so due to the additional `N`), so we expect a comparable or slightly higher value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong EWG effect of `S(N)(=O)=O` and the aromatic system, the predicted value is likely **slightly higher** than `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (0.90664939). 

**Predicted value: 0.92** (rounded to two decimal places). 

### Exact Prediction:
Based on the closest analog (`Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` at 0.90664939) and the stronger EWG nature of `S(N)(=O)=O`, the predicted value is:

**0.925** (interpolated between 0.906 and 0.97, accounting for the sulfonamide's stronger effect than nitro). 

Thus, the final predicted property value for `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` is **0.925**.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.9513572359496812
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like** or **benz[a]anthracene-like** structure. It can be represented as:
```
  4   3
   \ /
1---2
   / \
  5   6
```
(where the numbers represent the fused rings, and the exact connectivity is as per the SMILES notation).

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Fused Rings**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: **-0.39293712**): A fused 4-ring system with a methyl group.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property: **0.48536931**): A 5-ring fused PAH (likely benz[a]anthracene or similar).
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: **0.84562998**): A 3-ring fused system (likely anthracene/fluorene-like with a methyl group).

2. **Trends**:
   - Fused aromatic systems with more rings tend to have **moderate positive or negative values**, depending on substitution and symmetry.
   - The presence of **heteroatoms or polar groups** (e.g., Cl, O, N) often shifts the property significantly (e.g., Cl-substituted aromatics like **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** have **0.84302421**).
   - Fully conjugated, symmetric, and unsubstituted PAHs (like **C1CCCC1**, property **0.98920919**) tend to have **higher positive values**, while less symmetric or substituted ones may have lower or negative values.

### Prediction for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**:
- This is a **fully conjugated, symmetric, unsubstituted 4-ring PAH** (similar to tetracene or benz[a]anthracene but with a slightly different connectivity).
- It lacks heteroatoms or polar groups, so the property will depend on its **aromaticity and symmetry**.
- Comparing to **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property **0.48536931**), which is a 5-ring PAH, this 4-ring system might have a **slightly higher value** due to reduced complexity but similar conjugation.
- The symmetric, unsubstituted nature suggests a **positive property value**, likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the examples and trends, the predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is approximately:  
**0.62** (rounded to two decimal places).  

This aligns with the behavior of similar fused aromatic systems in the dataset.

Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This structure contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), a carbonyl group (C=O), and aromatic rings with oxygen substitutions, which are often associated with higher property values in the dataset (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** has a value of **0.99443572**, and **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** has a value of **0.99067879**). These high values are linked to extended conjugated systems with polar substituents.

### Key observations:
1. **Multiple -OH groups**: Increase polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, often raising the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings + oxygen substitutions**: Contribute to conjugation and polarity (e.g., **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** has **0.48536931**, but this lacks polar groups).
3. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: Adds polarity and electronic effects.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** (0.99067879): Similar polyphenol + carbonyl + extended conjugation.
- **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (0.53971529): Fewer -OH groups but similar features.

Given the abundance of -OH groups and conjugated systems, the property value is likely **very high**, close to the upper limit observed in the dataset.

### Predicted property value:
**0.992** (approximating the trend for highly polar, conjugated, polyoxygenated molecules). 

This is slightly below the highest values in the dataset due to fewer bulky substituents (e.g., no halogens or large alkyl groups), but the extensive hydrogen bonding and conjugation support a value near **0.99**.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.15247138736965266
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate or thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have property values around **0.76**.
   - Molecules with phosphonate groups (e.g., `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl`) have more negative values (e.g., **-0.84**).

2. **Sulfur-containing groups**:
   - Thiol or thioether groups (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) are associated with positive values (e.g., **0.90**).
   - Thiophosphates (e.g., `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`) have moderately negative values (e.g., **-0.59**).

3. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - Presence of amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tends to give positive or near-zero values (e.g., **0.52**).
   - If combined with other electronegative groups, the value may become more negative.

4. **Combination of P=O, S, and NC=O**:
   - The molecule `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` contains:
     - A phosphate group (`P(=O)`),
     - A thioether (`S`),
     - An amide (`NC(C)=O`).
   - The phosphate and amide groups may pull the value toward the negative side, while the sulfur may offset this slightly.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (thiophosphate + Cl aromatic): **0.76**
- `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl` (phosphonate + amide-like): **-0.84**
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (thiophosphate + thioether + amide): **-0.59**

Given that `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` has:
- A phosphate (P=O) instead of thiophosphate (P=S), which is more electronegative,
- An amide (NC=O), which is moderately negative,
- A thioether (S), which is less electronegative than oxygen,

The property value is likely to be **moderately negative**, similar to the thiophosphate-amide example (**-0.59**) but slightly more negative due to the P=O group.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on the balance of P=O, S, and NC=O contributions). 

This aligns with the trend where phosphate + amide + sulfur gives values in the range of **-0.5 to -0.8**.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.8326533648493162
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene). 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine-containing molecules** tend to have negative property values, especially when multiple chlorines are present (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a value of -0.88378934, and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has -0.85267184).
2. **Simple alkenes** (like C=C) without polar or bulky groups tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative (e.g., CC1=CCCCC1 has -0.80653817, but this is a cyclohexene with additional carbons).
3. The presence of **two chlorines on a small alkene** (like 1,2-dichloroethene) is likely to result in a moderately negative value, similar to other small chlorinated molecules.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is small and has two chlorines attached to a double bond. Given the examples, this would likely result in a **negative property value**, but not as extreme as heavily chlorinated aromatic systems. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.7**, based on:
- The simplicity of the structure (less negative than poly-chlorinated aromatics).
- The presence of two electronegative chlorines (pushing the value negative).

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.63** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

This aligns with the observation that small chlorinated molecules in the dataset (e.g., CCBr with -0.59064694) have moderately negative values, and adding another chlorine (as in Cl\C=C/Cl) would further decrease the property value.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.5074623229166301
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms (N, O, etc.):**
   - **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 0.92005074 (phenol with Cl substituent)
   - **Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 0.86173979 (nitrophenol)
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: 0.86173979 (same as above, positional isomer)
   - **COc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -0.26247976 (methoxy-nitrophenyl, significantly lower)
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: -0.70033257 (N-methylaniline)
   - **CCNc1ccccc1**: 0.44729554 (N-ethylaniline, higher than N-methylaniline)
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.11667417 (polycyclic N-heteroaromatic)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.82864696 (N-heteroaromatic with methoxy)

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems:**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: 0.48536931 (polycyclic aromatic)
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1**: -0.85154749 (polycyclic aromatic, very low)
   - **Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32**: -0.11308349 (indane derivative)
   - **Cc1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1**: 0.84562998 (polycyclic aromatic with methyl)

3. **Pyridine-Like Structures:**
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.11667417 (N-heteroaromatic, similar to pyridine but fused)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.82864696 (more complex N-heteroaromatic)

### Analysis for **c1ccncc1 (Pyridine):**
- Pyridine is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. 
- Compared to benzene derivatives, nitrogen introduces polarity and lone-pair effects, which may lower the property value (as seen in N-methylaniline: -0.70033257).
- However, pyridine is less substituted than many of the examples, and its property value may not be as extreme as some of the highly substituted or polycyclic systems.
- The closest analog is **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (-0.11667417), but pyridine is simpler and likely less negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, pyridine likely has a property value in the **slightly negative to near-zero range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.25**  

This is based on:
- Simplicity of the structure (less negative than fused N-heteroaromatics).
- Nitrogen's effect being less dramatic than in highly substituted cases (e.g., N-methylaniline is -0.70, but pyridine lacks the additional methyl).

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.4077402634897905
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`) – similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property: 0.06151497), which tend to have low-moderate positive values.
   - Ester (`COC(=O)-`) – similar to `CCOC(=O)CC` (property: -0.00018234) or `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property: -0.55782988). Esters can vary but often contribute negatively.
   - Aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3...`) – similar to `Nc1ccccc1` in some examples, which can be slightly negative or neutral.
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic (`cc(Cl)ccc23`) – similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property: -0.6648188) or `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)...` (property: 0.97924725). Chlorine can be variable but often leans negative unless heavily substituted.

2. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - Benzene and fused heteroaromatic rings (`c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3...`) – similar to polyaromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property: 0.48536931) or `c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34` (property: 0.95135724). These can push the value higher, but substituents matter.

3. **Overall polarity and balance**:
   - The molecule has both polar (OH, ester, Cl) and aromatic components. The ester and chloro groups likely dominate, pulling the value negative, but the polyol and aromaticity may offset this slightly.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property: -0.55782988): Diester with aromatic, moderately negative.
- `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (property: 0.29680955): Aromatic with polar amides, slightly positive.
- `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property: -0.6648188): Halogenated aromatic, negative.
- `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl` (property: -0.88570899): Highly chlorinated phenol, very negative.

### Prediction:
Given the ester, chloroaromatic, and polyol groups, the molecule likely has a **moderately negative property value**, similar to other polar/aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups. The exact value is hard to pinpoint, but a reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final predicted value:
**-0.62**  
*(This aligns with the trend seen for esters + chloroaromatics in the examples, e.g., closer to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` but slightly less negative due to the polyol)*.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.29227969420733435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (butylbenzene) has a property value of **0.36316148**.
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene) has a property value of **0.17716604**.
   - **CCCCCCCI** (iodohexane) has a property value of **-0.77678944**, but this includes a heavy halogen (I), which likely skews the value downward.
   - Hydrocarbon chains without polar groups tend to have moderately positive values (~0.1 to 0.4).

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate) has a property value of **0.75796879**.
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) has a property value of **0.84633417**.
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a property value of **0.9061197**.
   - Alcohols and esters with oxygen tend to have higher positive values (~0.7 to 0.9).

3. **Alcohols**:
   - The presence of an **-OH** group (as in **OC1CCCCCCC1**) significantly increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol (1-pentanol), similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** but with a shorter chain.

4. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains with polar groups (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**) have high values (~0.74687979), but this is a complex steroid-like molecule.
   - Simpler alcohols like **CCCCCO** should have a slightly lower value than **OC1CCCCCCC1** due to the shorter chain.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- The molecule is a linear alcohol with 5 carbons, similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) but less cyclic and less bulky.
- Given the trend that alcohols have high positive values (~0.7 to 0.9) and linear chains are slightly lower than cyclic ones, I estimate:
  - **Property value for CCCCCCO: ~0.85**.

### Refining the Estimate:
- **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) is 0.846, and **COC=O** (methyl formate) is 0.757. The longer chain increases the value.
- **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) is 0.906, but cyclic structures may have higher values.
- For **CCCCCO** (linear pentanol), a reasonable interpolation gives **~0.85**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is **0.85**.

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.9602309461460903
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** has a value of **0.24941082**.
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has a value of **-0.51076405**.
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing/donating groups influence the property.

2. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. Examples with sulfonyl/similar groups:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.76928857**.
   - Sulfonyl groups tend to decrease the property value (negative contribution).

3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is polar and can hydrogen bond. Examples:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has a value of **-0.26411071**.
   - Amides often reduce the property value.

4. **Heterocycle (CCO1)**: The 5-membered ring with oxygen and sulfur may add complexity. Similar heterocycles:
   - **Cc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O** has a value of **0.80144692**, but this is more polar.
   - Heterocycles with sulfonyl groups are likely to lower the value.

5. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule is quite polar due to the sulfonyl, amide, and aromatic groups. Polar molecules in the examples tend to have lower (often negative) values.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog might be **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** (value = **0.07299072**), which has a phosphorothioate group (similar to sulfonyl) and an aromatic ring. However, our molecule has more polar groups (sulfonyl + amide), likely pushing the value lower.
- Another similar molecule is **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (value = **-0.26411071**), which has an amide and aromatic ring but lacks the sulfonyl group. Adding the sulfonyl would likely make the value more negative.

### Predicted Value:
Given the combined effects of the sulfonyl (strongly negative contribution), amide (moderately negative), and aromatic ring (can be positive or neutral), the property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (specific value between -0.3 and -0.6, balancing the contributions). 

However, looking at the examples, a more precise fit might be closer to **-0.35** (similar to **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** but adjusted for the sulfonyl group). 

But since sulfonyl groups in the examples (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** at **-0.76928857**) pull the value down significantly, and our molecule is less polar than that, a compromise is:  
**-0.55**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.55** (specific value based on structural similarity and trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples and their trends. The true value could vary slightly depending on the property's exact definition.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.012633938725902977
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: From the examples, molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 0.94413854). The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and often correlates with positive property values.
2. **Ester groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in molecules like `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC`, which has a high property value (0.94425389). This suggests esters contribute positively.
3. **Substituted aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1C`) can have high values (1.00744804).
4. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (NC=)**: Nitrogen in a ring (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2`) can have moderate positive values (0.09031352), but the effect depends on context.
5. **Branching and alkyl groups (C(C))**: These often reduce the property value (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CC` has -0.88752895), but here they are secondary to the stronger contributions from the nitro and ester groups.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.94413854) but with additional ester groups and a heterocyclic nitrogen. The esters likely add slightly more positive contribution.
- It also shares features with `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` (property = 0.94425389), which has two ester groups and a large aromatic system.

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contributions from the nitro group and two ester groups, along with the aromatic system, the property value is likely **highly positive**, similar to the examples above. The exact value is hard to pinpoint without a model, but based on the closest analogs, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.95** (likely in the range 0.94–0.96). 

This aligns with the trend that nitro-aromatics and esters drive the property upward.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.34572556186542025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). The amides are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, while the cyclopropane introduces ring strain.
2. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, with two identical amide groups flanking the cyclopropane ring. Symmetric molecules often have intermediate property values unless strongly polar or bulky.
3. **Polarity**: The amides make the molecule polar, but the cyclopropane is nonpolar. This balance suggests moderate polarity.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1** (pyridine, property = 0.507) and **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine, property = 0.996) show that nitrogen-containing heterocycles can have higher values, but this molecule lacks aromaticity.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like, property = 0.156) and **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane, property = 0.063) suggest that saturated rings with polar groups tend toward intermediate values.
   - The presence of two amides is somewhat analogous to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.012), but without the aromatic and chlorine substituents, the value should be lower.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetric, polar-but-balanced nature of the molecule, the property value is likely **intermediate**, similar to other cyclic structures with polar groups but without extreme features (e.g., strong electron-withdrawing groups or large conjugated systems). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This aligns with examples like **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (0.156, less polar) and **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1.012, more polar), placing it midway due to its two amides and small ring.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.9640689347981788
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in how certain structural features influence the property value. Let's analyze the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane) in the context of these trends:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - Chlorine atoms generally decrease the property value (negative contribution). 
   - Examples: 
     - `Clc1ccccc1` (chlorobenzene): -0.318
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (pentachlorobenzene): -0.033
     - `Clc1ccccc1I` (iodochlorobenzene): -0.665
     - `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` (hexachlorinated hydrocarbon): -0.847

2. **Small Aliphatic Chains with Halogens**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains with halogens tend to have negative property values.
   - Example: `CC#N` (acetonitrile): -0.740 (though this is a nitrile, the small size and electronegativity are relevant).

3. **Chloroethane (ClCC)**:
   - This is a very small molecule with a single chlorine substituent on a two-carbon chain.
   - Compared to chlorobenzene (`Clc1ccccc1`, -0.318), chloroethane lacks aromaticity and has fewer atoms, so the property value is likely more negative due to the dominance of the electronegative chlorine.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **ClCC** is expected to have a property value between **-0.5 and -0.8**. A reasonable estimate, considering its simplicity and the strong electronegativity of chlorine, is:

**Predicted property value for ClCC: -0.65**  

This aligns with the observed negative contributions of chlorine in similar small molecules (e.g., `CC#N` at -0.74, `Clc1ccccc1` at -0.318). The lack of aromaticity or additional stabilizing features pushes the value further negative.

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.8876086766708315
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, we can infer trends in the property values based on structural features:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl/Br) aromatic systems** tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl: -0.8818, Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl: -0.8527, BrC(Cl)Cl: -0.8701).
2. **Polar functional groups (NO₂, OH, etc.)** further decrease the property value when combined with halogens.
3. **Non-halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons** often have **positive values** (e.g., CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C: 0.908).
4. The presence of **nitrogen in the aromatic ring** (e.g., pyridine-like structures) can modulate the value but depends on substitution.

### Target Molecule: **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**
- **Structure**: Chlorinated pyridine (nitrogen in the ring) with a CCl₃ group.
- **Analogous Examples**:
  - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: -0.6596 (chlorinated biphenyl + CCl₃).
  - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl: -0.8818 (highly chlorinated + NO₂).
- The pyridine nitrogen may slightly increase the value compared to pure chlorinated benzenes, but the CCl₃ group strongly pulls it negative.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of:
- Aromatic chlorination (negative contribution).
- CCl₃ group (strong negative contribution).
- Pyridine nitrogen (slight positive offset but outweighed by halogens).

The property value is likely **between -0.65 and -0.85**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75 ± 0.05**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.8757329100346165
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol) and compare it to similar structures in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of an alcohol group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with an -OH group tend to have property values that vary widely, but often fall in the mid-range (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC` has a value of `0.00382969`, while `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has `0.92005074`).
   - The exact value seems to depend heavily on the rest of the structure (e.g., aromaticity, branching, or other functional groups).

2. **Branching and chain length**:
   - The molecule `CCCC(O)CCC` (linear 4-heptanol) has a value of `0.00382969`.
   - The molecule `CCC(C)CCO` (branched 2-methyl-1-pentanol) has a value of `-0.87573291`.
   - The molecule `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (1-phenylethanol) has a value of `0.52763681`.

3. **CCCCC(C)O (2-hexanol)**:
   - This is a branched alcohol with a 6-carbon chain, similar to `CCC(C)CCO` (2-methyl-1-pentanol) but with one more carbon in the chain.
   - Branching tends to lower the property value (compare `CCC(C)CCO` with `CCCC(O)CCC`), but the exact position of the -OH group also matters.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- `CCCC(O)CCC` (linear) has a value of `0.00382969`.
- `CCC(C)CCO` (branched) has a value of `-0.87573291`.

The molecule `CCCCC(C)O` is branched like `CCC(C)CCO` but with a longer chain, which might slightly mitigate the reduction caused by branching. Thus, its value is likely between these two examples but closer to the branched case.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is approximately **`-0.5`**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trends in the dataset. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.7915354014652132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorodiphenyl, property: -0.61531117)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene, property: -0.85267184)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol, property: -0.85267184)
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (chloroform, property: -0.87032675)
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform-like, property: 0.29150418)

   Halogenated aromatics with multiple halogens (especially Cl) tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.6 to -0.8. The presence of additional functional groups (e.g., -OH) does not seem to drastically change this trend.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorinated analogs (due to increased polarizability or steric effects).
   - For example, **CI** (iodomethane-like, property: 0.69443914) has a high value, suggesting heavier halogens may increase the property.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted benzenes (para-substitution) like **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** have property values around -0.85. 
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is the brominated analog of this structure.

### Prediction:
- The brominated analog (**Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**) is expected to have a property value **less negative** than its chlorinated counterpart due to the heavier bromine atoms. 
- From the examples, 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a value of -0.85267184. Replacing Cl with Br would likely increase the property value (less negative) but still keep it in the negative range (since halogens generally decrease the property). 
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than -0.85, perhaps around **-0.7 to -0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the data, the predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is:  
**-0.65** (approximate, based on trends).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would align with bromine being less polar than chlorine but heavier.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: -0.8837893436169459
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to correlate with the degree of halogenation (particularly chlorine and bromine), molecular size, and aromaticity. 

The molecule in question is:
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with significant symmetry and aromaticity. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = -0.72727777):  
   This is a heavily chlorinated biphenyl with even more chlorines than the query molecule, and its property value is negative and moderately large in magnitude.

2. **ClC(Br)Br** (property = 0.62307572):  
   A small, halogenated aliphatic molecule with a positive property value.

3. Other chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12**, property = -0.66173653) also tend to have negative values.

The query molecule is less chlorinated than the first example but still heavily chlorinated and aromatic. Given the trend, we can infer that:
- Increased chlorination in aromatic systems correlates with more negative property values.
- The query molecule is intermediate in chlorination between the first example (-0.727) and other chlorinated aromatics (~ -0.6 to -0.7).

Thus, a reasonable prediction for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** would be slightly less negative than the first example but still in the same range.

**Predicted property value: -0.68** (approximate, based on the trend).

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.7074642555329244
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)**: Highly polar and likely to contribute to a higher property value.
3. **Methyl groups (C)**: Non-polar, but their presence on aromatic rings may slightly reduce polarity.
4. **Ether linkages (Oc2... and Oc3...)**: Polar but less so than the phosphate group.
5. **Bulkiness**: The molecule is large and has significant steric hindrance.

### Comparison with similar molecules from the examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (e.g., phosphate, nitro, or multiple halogens) tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` has a value of **1.01172776**).
- Aromaticity alone (e.g., `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`) can lead to high values (**0.99011455**).
- The phosphate group here is similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (value: **1.01028477**), suggesting a high contribution.

### Predicted property value:
Given the strong polarity from the phosphate group and the aromaticity, but balanced by the non-polar methyl groups, the predicted value is likely close to **0.95**. 

However, looking at the examples, the phosphate-containing molecules tend to have values around **1.0**, so a more precise prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.986** (similar to the highly polar/aromatic examples). 

### Final answer:
**0.986**

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.00480606496220759
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and electron-withdrawing group. From the examples, molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, CF3) tend to have higher positive property values (e.g., `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O` has a value of `1.01161202`).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The presence of an aromatic ring (benzene) with substitutions (CF3 and a heterocyclic group) is common in many examples. The exact substitution pattern matters, but electron-withdrawing groups on the ring often increase the property value.
3. **Heterocyclic group (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar, and likely electron-withdrawing group due to the carbonyl (=O) and chlorine atoms. Such groups can contribute to higher property values (similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with a value of `1.00939616`).
4. **Chlorine atoms**: Chlorine substitutions are present in many examples, and their effect depends on the context. Here, they are part of a polar heterocycle, likely contributing to a higher property value.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (highly chlorinated, value = `1.00939616`).
- `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O` (strong electron-withdrawing NO2 groups, value = `1.01161202`).
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (NO2 and Cl, but value = `-0.60173748`; this is an outlier, possibly due to sterics or other effects).

Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of CF3 and the polar heterocycle with Cl and =O, the molecule is likely to have a **high positive property value**, similar to the highly substituted/electron-withdrawing examples above.

### Predicted property value:
A reasonable estimate would be close to the high-end values in the dataset, around **`0.95`**. 

However, considering the complexity of the heterocycle (which might introduce some steric or electronic effects that slightly reduce the value), a slightly lower but still high value is plausible. 

**Final predicted value: `0.92`** (similar to `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` with `0.97367161` or `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with `1.00939616`). 

This balances the strong electron-withdrawing effects with the structural complexity.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.26247975568580245
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Present in the molecule as **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**.
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Present as **N(=O)=O**.
   - **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring with methoxy and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: This molecule has two nitro groups on a benzene ring and has a property value of **-0.86552303**.
   - **c1ccccc1O**: Phenol (benzene with -OH) has a value of **-0.71382269**.
   - **Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2**: A fused aromatic system with -OH has a value of **0.44810039**.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1**: Toluene derivative has a value of **-0.75066747**.
   - **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Aromatic with Cl and nitro-like groups has a value of **-0.88760868**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is **-0.86552303**).
   - Methoxy groups are less electron-withdrawing than nitro groups but can have a modest effect (no direct example, but phenol is **-0.71382269**).
   - The molecule is a monosubstituted benzene with one nitro and one methoxy group, which is somewhat similar to the dinitrobenzene example but with one less nitro group.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The presence of the nitro group will pull the value toward the negative range, similar to the dinitrobenzene example but less extreme because there is only one nitro group.
   - The methoxy group is less influential than the nitro group but may slightly offset the negative effect.
   - A reasonable estimate would be between the phenol value (**-0.71382269**) and the dinitrobenzene value (**-0.86552303**), likely closer to the dinitrobenzene due to the strong effect of the nitro group.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.79** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar molecules). 

This is a rough estimate given the examples, where nitro-substituted aromatics tend to have values around **-0.7 to -0.9**, and methoxy substitution does not drastically change this trend. The exact value would depend on more precise modeling, but this is a reasonable prediction based on the given data.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.1600942787442079
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular polarity, hydrophobicity, or some other electronic or steric property influenced by functional groups and halogenation. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated, which tends to make it more polar and likely to have a negative property value (as seen in other chlorinated examples like `ClCCCl` (-0.877), `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.853), and `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (-0.749)).

The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple chlorine atoms attached, which will significantly increase its polarity and likely its negative property value. Comparing it to similar heavily chlorinated structures in the dataset, we can estimate its property value to be in the range of -0.75 to -0.90.

Given the extreme chlorination and steric bulk, I predict the property value for:
`ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`  
to be approximately **-0.88**. 

This aligns with trends observed in other highly chlorinated molecules in the dataset.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.288546595900235
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -Br, -Cl) tend to have negative property values.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar groups (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings without electronegative substituents) often correlate with positive values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
   - Ethers (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**) and esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) often have negative values (e.g., -0.886 for **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**).
   - Carbonyl groups (C=O) in esters or aldehydes tend to lower the property value unless balanced by other features.

3. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCC#C**) can lead to positive values (e.g., 0.296 for **CCC#C**), but when combined with polar groups, the effect is dampened or reversed.

4. **Hybridization and Unsaturation**:
   - Triple bonds (e.g., **C#C**) sometimes increase the property value (e.g., 0.296 for **CCC#C**), but this is context-dependent.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O**:
- **Structure**: Propyl formate is an ester (R-COO-R'), with a formate group (HC=O) attached to a propyl chain.
- **Similar Examples**:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has a property value of **-0.886** (ester with an aromatic ring and polar -N group).
  - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has a value of **-0.787** (ester with additional polar groups).
  - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole, an ether) is not directly comparable, but esters generally have more negative values than ethers due to the additional polar carbonyl group.
- **Conclusion**: The ester group (**C=O** and **O-alkyl**) is strongly polar and will likely dominate, giving a negative property value. The propyl chain is nonpolar but not enough to offset the ester's effect.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **CCCOC=O** is expected to have a **negative property value** similar to other esters. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.75**  
*(This is an interpolation between the more complex ester examples and simpler polar molecules.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9979035574158169
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with property **-0.83252304**) tend to have negative values, but this isn't always consistent. 
   - The presence of polar or functional groups can significantly alter the property.

2. **Ester Groups (COOR)**:
   - Molecules with ester groups (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**, property **0.13948988**) often have mid-range positive values.
   - The ester group in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is similar to these examples.

3. **Polar vs. Nonpolar Balance**:
   - The long hydrophobic chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) would contribute negatively, but the polar ester (**C(=O)OCC**) would offset this, likely resulting in a mid-range positive value.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (property **0.9061197**) has a long chain and a polar carbonyl, yielding a high positive value.
   - **CCCOC** (property **0.84405744**) is a simple ether with a positive value.
   - The ester in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is more polar than an ether but less polar than a free acid, so the value should be slightly lower than these examples.

### Prediction:
Given the long aliphatic chain (**C10**) and the polar ester group, the property value is likely in the **mid-to-high positive range**, similar to other esters or carbonyl-containing molecules in the dataset. 

Comparing to **CCCCC(CC)C=O (0.9061197)** and **CCCOC (0.84405744)**, the longer chain in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** would reduce the polarity slightly, but the ester group is still strongly contributing. 

Thus, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.75** (with an expected range of 0.7 to 0.8 based on similar examples). 

### Final Answer:
**0.75**

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.993615157347883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.64919304), but with additional substitutions.
2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.74550879) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = 0.44361708). Amides tend to lower the property value.
3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.60173748) and **NNc1ccccc1** (property = -0.64311952). Nitro groups strongly reduce the property value.
4. **Chlorine substitutions**: Multiple Cl atoms are present, similar to **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.60173748) and **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property = -0.68224078). Chlorines tend to lower the property value, especially when combined with other electronegative groups.

### Key Observations:
- The molecule combines a phenol-like core (which might slightly increase the property) with an amide and a nitro group (both of which significantly decrease the property).
- The presence of two Cl atoms and the nitro group suggests a strong negative contribution.
- The closest analog is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.74550879), which has an amide and Cl substitutions but lacks the nitro group. Adding the nitro group would likely further reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of the amide, nitro, and Cl substitutions, the property value is expected to be more negative than -0.74550879 (the amide + Cl reference) but not as extreme as some of the highly negative examples (e.g., **Cl\C=C/Cl** at -0.83265336). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = -0.78**  

This aligns with the trend of amide + nitro + Cl combinations in the dataset.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.8260742393862217
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, presence of halogens (especially chlorine), and functional groups like carbonyls, amines, and sulfides. The property appears to be influenced by:

1. **Aromatic rings**: Often associated with mid-range values (e.g., benzene derivatives like `c1ccccc1` = 0.585, `C=Cc1ccccc1` = -0.830).
2. **Halogens (Cl)**: Tend to lower the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = -0.004, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` = -0.004).
3. **Polar groups (e.g., carbonyl, hydroxyl, sulfides)**: Can either increase or decrease the value depending on context.
4. **Sulfur-containing groups (e.g., thioethers, sulfides)**: Often associated with positive values (e.g., `CCSSCC` = 0.534, `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` = 0.569).
5. **Phosphorothioate groups (P(=S))**: Present in some molecules with mid-range values (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` = -0.733).

### Analysis of the target molecule:
`COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1`

1. **Structure**:
   - Contains two aromatic rings (`c1ccc...cc1` and `c2ccc...cc2`).
   - Two phosphorothioate groups (`P(=S)(OC)`).
   - A thioether linkage (`S` between the two aromatic rings).
   - No halogens (Cl, Br, etc.), which often lower the value.

2. **Analogous examples**:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` (property = 0.569) has a sulfide (`S`) and aromatic ring.
   - `CCSSCC` (property = 0.534) has a disulfide linkage.
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = -0.733) has a phosphorothioate but also a Cl, which lowers the value.

3. **Key observations**:
   - The absence of Cl suggests the value won't be heavily negative.
   - The presence of two phosphorothioate groups and a thioether linkage is likely to increase the value (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` and `CCSSCC`).
   - The aromatic rings contribute moderately.

### Predicted property:
Given the combination of aromaticity, sulfur linkages, and phosphorothioate groups, the value is likely in the mid-to-high positive range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65** (approximately between 0.534 and 0.569, slightly higher due to additional aromaticity and phosphorothioate groups).

True Property: 0.8617397869929911
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a property value of **0.94413854**.
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a property value of **-0.28712606** (note the additional chloro substituents and complexity).
   - The nitro group alone (on a benzene ring with a methyl substituent) correlates with a high positive value (~0.94).

2. **Presence of Hydroxy Group (OH)**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has a property value of **0.94413854** (same as the nitro example above, but with an amide and hydroxy group).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property value of **1.00726406** (chloro substituents dominate here).
   - The hydroxy group alone (on a benzene ring) tends to increase the property value, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing/donating groups.

3. **Combination of OH and NO2 on Benzene Ring**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a benzene ring with a hydroxy group (OH) and a nitro group (NO2) in para positions (based on the SMILES notation). This is structurally similar to:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = 0.94413854), but with NO2 instead of NC(=O).
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = 0.94413854), but with OH instead of CH3.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, and the hydroxy group is electron-donating (but can also exhibit some electron-withdrawing character due to resonance). The combination of these two groups on the benzene ring is likely to result in a high positive property value, similar to the examples above.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = 0.94413854) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = 0.94413854), and the fact that the hydroxy and nitro groups are both significant contributors to the property value, the predicted property for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely very close to these examples.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **0.94413854**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.3298204021284223
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, size, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a large, highly polar carbohydrate with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (O-). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `0.0056207`, and larger sugars or polar molecules like `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` have values around `-0.73058857`).
- The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) or aromatic systems can shift the value positively or negatively depending on the context, but the dominant factor here is the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.

The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is a branched oligosaccharide with extensive hydroxyl groups, making it very polar and likely to have a negative property value similar to other highly polar, hydrogen-bonding molecules in the dataset. 

Comparing to the most similar examples:
- `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a small sugar) has a value of `0.0056207`.
- Larger polar molecules like steroids or complex sugars have values in the range of `-0.6` to `-0.8`.

Given the size and polarity of this molecule, the predicted property value would likely be **around `-0.6` to `-0.7`**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: `-0.650`**  

This aligns with the trend where large, highly polar molecules with many hydroxyl groups have moderately negative values in the given dataset.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.29595612114344905
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne) by analyzing trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes and Nitriles (C#C or C#N groups)**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a dinitrile) has a high positive value (**0.90269526**).
   - **CCC#C** is a terminal alkyne, which is somewhat similar to nitriles in terms of bond polarity (sp hybridization).

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (a simple alcohol) has a value close to zero (**0.00382969**).
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (a long-chain alcohol) has a negative value (**-0.85463582**).
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (a longer-chain alcohol) has a positive value (**0.8244019**), suggesting chain length may flip the sign unpredictably.
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone) has a negative value (**-0.11580922**).

3. **Terminal Alkynes vs. Internal Alkynes**:
   - No direct examples of terminal alkynes are given, but **CCC#C** is a small, linear molecule with a polarizable triple bond.

4. **Small Polar vs. Nonpolar Molecules**:
   - Small nonpolar molecules (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**) have moderate positive values (~0.36).
   - Small polar molecules (e.g., **Nc1nc[nH]n1**) have values close to zero (**0.07061851**).

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- The triple bond introduces some polarity, but the molecule is small and not as polar as nitriles or alcohols.
- It is unlikely to have a very high or very low value. Given the examples, I would expect a moderate positive value, similar to small hydrocarbons or nitriles but lower than **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**.
- A reasonable guess would be in the range of **0.3 to 0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the lack of exact matches, I'll estimate the property for **CCC#C** as:  
**0.35** (moderate positive value, similar to small polarizable hydrocarbons).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or some other descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.9277575775676491
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N) tend to have lower (more negative) values, while nonpolar or less polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halogens without polar groups) tend to have higher (more positive) values.
2. **Halogen Substitution**: Chlorine (Cl) and other halogens can influence the property, especially when combined with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-). Multiple Cl substitutions often lower the value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has -0.88378934).
3. **Phosphorus/Sulfur Groups**: Molecules with P(=S) or similar groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has -0.73380079, `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has 1.00614855) show variability but often lean toward mid-to-high positive values when combined with nonpolar chains.
4. **Aromatic Systems**: Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -Cl) tend to lower the value, while nonpolar aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1`) have moderately negative values.

### Target Molecule: `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`
- **Structure**: Contains a P(=S) group (like some examples with mid-to-high positive values), an ethoxy group (CCO-), and a trichlorophenoxy group (`Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`).
- **Key Observations**:
  - The P(=S) group is present in molecules with values ranging from -0.73380079 to 1.00614855.
  - The trichlorophenoxy group is highly polar and likely lowers the value (similar to other Cl-heavy molecules with negative values).
  - The ethoxy and ethyl groups add some nonpolar character, which may offset the polarity slightly.

### Prediction:
The combination of P(=S) (which can increase the value) and the highly polar trichlorophenoxy group (which decreases the value) suggests a mid-range value. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This balances the opposing effects of the P(=S) group (positive contribution) and the polar/Cl-heavy aromatic system (negative contribution).

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.9440025968163953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring (`c1nccc...c1`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide or hydrazone-like group).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic nitrogen (in the pyridine ring).
   - Carbonyl group (`C=O`) conjugated with a hydrazine (`NN`) group, which is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of the polar `C(=O)NN` group suggests moderate to high polarity, but the aromatic pyridine ring may counterbalance this somewhat.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Polar Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`) tend to have property values ranging from moderately positive to negative, depending on the balance of polar/nonpolar features.
- **Aromatic + Polar Substituents**: 
  - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = 0.6048363): Similar aromatic + polar substituent (amine), positive value.
  - `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (property = 0.87763655): Aromatic + polar (amine and chloro), positive value.
  - `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (property = -0.73979093): Polar groups but more complex, negative value.
- **Hydrazide-like Groups**: No exact matches, but `C(=O)NN` is similar to amides/carbamates, which often have negative values (e.g., `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` = -0.82531017).

### Prediction:
The `C(=O)NN` group is highly polar and likely to dominate, but the aromatic pyridine ring may reduce the effect slightly. Given the examples, a moderately negative value seems plausible, similar to other polar-aromatic systems.

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  
*(Rationale: Between the negative values of complex polar aromatics and the positive values of simpler polar-aromatic systems.)*

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.5968365043333227
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This functional group is present in the molecule and is also seen in the example **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, which has a property value of **0.32767975**. Phosphorothioates often contribute moderately positive values due to their polar and electron-withdrawing nature.
   
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) is somewhat polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro or halogens. This may slightly increase the property value.

3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Present in the lactam ring (N1CCCCC1C), this is a polar group but is neutralized by the aliphatic ring. Similar amides in the examples (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) have values close to zero (0.00018234).

4. **Aliphatic Chains (CCCO, OCCC, etc.)**: These are non-polar and typically contribute negative or near-zero values (e.g., **CCCCCCCI** has -0.77678944, but shorter chains are less negative).

5. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is large with mixed polar/non-polar regions, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, but with additional non-polar bulk (e.g., the cyclohexyl ring).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 (0.32767975)**, but our molecule lacks the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (N(=O)=O), which would reduce the property value slightly.
- The presence of the thioether and amide groups may offset some of the non-polarity from the aliphatic chains.
- The cyclohexyl ring is non-polar but neutralized by the amide, similar to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (0.00018234)**.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of moderately polar (P(=S), SCC(=O)) and non-polar (aliphatic chains, cyclohexyl) groups, the property value is likely **slightly positive but lower than the phosphorothioate example with a nitro group**. 

**Predicted value: 0.15** (approximate, based on interpolation between similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.17388476386298507
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, particularly with functional groups, polarity, and molecular size. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or heteroatoms, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **0.00382969**. This molecule is similar but has a polar hydroxyl group (-OH), which likely increases its property value slightly compared to a pure hydrocarbon.
2. **CCCC/C=C/C** (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-0.86439193**, but this includes a double bond, which introduces some polarity/unsaturation.
3. **CCCCCC** (hexane, though not explicitly listed) would be even simpler, but the trend suggests pure alkanes have low or slightly negative property values.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a longer alkane than **CCCCCCCO** but lacks any polar groups, its property value should be slightly lower than **0.00382969** (the value for **CCCCCCCO**). 

Looking at other non-polar or weakly polar molecules:
- **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (a cyclohexane derivative) has a value of **-0.34676815**.
- **CC(C)CCO** (a branched alcohol) has **-0.29227969**.

Given that **CCCCCCCC** is purely non-polar and lacks functional groups, its property value should be close to zero but slightly negative. 

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCCCC**: **-0.35** (approximate, based on the trend for non-polar alkanes in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value likely reflects a physicochemical property like logP, solubility, or a similar descriptor where non-polarity reduces the value.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.20537424979791694
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O), hydroxyl groups (OH), aromatic rings, halogens, and overall molecular complexity (e.g., steroids or polycyclic structures). 

The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with the following features:
1. Multiple rings (steroid backbone).
2. A carbonyl group (C=O).
3. Hydroxyl groups (OH).
4. An alkyne group (C#C).

From the examples, similar steroid-like molecules with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups tend to have property values close to **1.0** (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of **1.00502679**, and `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a value of **-0.61484715**, but the latter lacks the alkyne and has fewer polar groups). 

Given the presence of both polar (C=O, OH) and nonpolar (alkyne, rings) features, the predicted property value is likely **close to 1.0**, similar to other steroid-like molecules in the dataset. 

### Predicted property value: **0.99375459**  
*(This matches closely with the example `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO`, which has a value of **0.99375459** and shares structural similarities.)*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.9952700507641221
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I'll attempt to predict the property value based on observed trends in the training data. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Key structural features in the target molecule**:
   - Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy -OCH3, hydroxyl -OH, ether -O-, carbonyl C=O)
   - Fused polycyclic structure with sugar-like moieties (resembling carbohydrate derivatives)
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like NO2, SO2) or strongly electron-donating groups (like NH2)

2. **Observations from training data**:
   - Oxygen-rich molecules tend to have mid-range positive values (e.g., 0.1836 for CCCCOCCO, 0.2969 for COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br)
   - Aromatic systems with oxygen substituents often show higher positive values (e.g., 0.9200 for Oc1ccccc1Cl, 0.9736 for COC(=O)c1ccccc1)
   - The presence of multiple oxygen atoms in cyclic structures tends to increase the value (e.g., 0.9703 for Fc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O)

3. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - The molecule resembles a glycoside derivative with multiple oxygen functionalities
   - Similar complex oxygenated structures in the training set (like C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 with -0.275) had negative values, but this had fewer aromatic rings
   - The aromatic components with oxygen substituents suggest a higher positive value

4. **Prediction**:
   Considering the balance between:
   - The positive contribution from aromatic + oxygen groups
   - The potential negative contribution from aliphatic oxygen-rich regions
   - The overall complexity and size of the molecule

The predicted property value is: **0.427** 

This places it in the mid-positive range, similar to other oxygen-rich aromatic systems but slightly tempered by the aliphatic sugar-like components.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.920050735720703
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends based on substituents and their effects on the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (4-nitrophenol) has a property value of **0.86173979**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above, repeated) also has **0.86173979**.
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly given) would likely have a lower value than nitrophenol due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group increasing the property value.

2. **Chlorinated aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a value of **-0.6648188**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has **-0.61531117**.
   - Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than nitro but more than hydrogen, so it should increase the property value compared to plain phenol but less than nitrophenol.

3. **Mixed substituents**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol) has **-0.54946996**, but this is complicated by the strong electron-withdrawing cyano group and heavy iodine atoms.
   - **Oc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)** (not explicitly given, but similar to methoxy-phenol) would likely have a lower value due to electron-donating methoxy.

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol):
- The property value should be between phenol (hypothetically ~0.0 to 0.3) and nitrophenol (0.86173979).
- Chlorine is moderately electron-withdrawing, so it will increase the value compared to plain phenol but not as much as nitro.
- From the examples, chloro-substituted aromatics tend to have negative or slightly positive values unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Given that:
- Phenol + Cl (moderate electron-withdrawing) should be less than nitrophenol but more than plain phenol.
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.3 to 0.5**.

Looking for similar examples:
- **CON(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (chlorinated aromatic with amides) has **0.20611857**.
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has **1.00939616**, but this is heavily chlorinated.

Given that 4-chlorophenol is simpler, a plausible value is **~0.4**.

However, comparing to **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (0.86173979) and noting that Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO2, we can interpolate:
- If NO2 gives ~0.86, and plain phenol might be ~0.1, then Cl (intermediate) could be ~0.4 to 0.6.

A precise estimate based on the trend is **0.45**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (specific value: **0.45000000**)

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.8708804170674661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **ClCC#CC**: A chloroalkyne fragment (rare in the examples, but halogens like Cl are present in many molecules).
   - **OC(=O)N**: A carbamate or urethane group (similar to amide-like fragments in the examples, e.g., `NC(=O)`).
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: A chlorinated aniline (similar to `Nc1ccccc1` in the examples, but with Cl substitution).
   - The molecule has **two Cl atoms**, which may increase polarity but could also lead to steric or electronic effects.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Cl substitution on aromatic rings** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) tend to have property values in the range **-0.8 to 0.3**, depending on other substituents.
   - **Amide/carbamate-like groups** (e.g., `NC(=O)`) often appear with values around **-0.2 to 0.9** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` has 0.994, while `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has -0.797).
   - The **alkyne group (`C#C`)** is uncommon in the examples, but linear aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCC`) tend to have positive values (~0.6).

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - The **Cl atoms** and **carbamate group** are electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value (similar to how `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` has -0.004).
   - However, the **alkyne** might counterbalance this slightly (as linear hydrocarbons like `CCCC` have positive values).

4. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - The aromatic ring with Cl substitution is similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)`, which has a value of **-0.883**, but the additional carbamate and alkyne may push the value toward the middle of the range.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- The presence of **two Cl atoms** and the **carbamate** suggests a value in the **negative to slightly positive range**.
- The **alkyne** might raise it slightly compared to purely Cl/amide-heavy molecules.
- Examples with similar fragments (Cl + amide) hover around **-0.8 to 0.3**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, carbamate) and the alkyne, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: -0.25**  

This aligns with molecules like `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (-0.204) or `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (-0.004), but slightly more negative due to the second Cl.  

### Final Answer:

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.9944357248388428
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a heterocycle with nitrogen),
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (both with **Cl** substitution).
   - A heterocyclic ring (**c2cncnc2**) with nitrogen atoms, which may contribute to polarity or hydrogen bonding.
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - Multiple **Cl** substitutions, which are electronegative and can influence lipophilicity or dipole moments.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Cl** substitutions (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**, property = 0.28898863; **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, property = 0.9500959) show a range of values depending on the number and arrangement of **Cl** atoms.
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**, property = -0.51076405) tend to have lower values.
   - Heterocycles with nitrogen (e.g., **Nc1nc[nH]n1**, property = 0.07061851) can have modest values.
   - The presence of two **Cl**-substituted phenyl rings and a heterocycle suggests moderate polarity but also significant steric and electronic effects.

4. **Property Trends**:
   - The hydroxyl group and heterocycle may lower the property value (like in **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**).
   - The **Cl** substitutions may increase the value (like in **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**).
   - The combination of these features suggests a balance, likely resulting in a value in the mid-range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with values around **0.2 to 0.5**, and considering the competing effects of polarity (from **OH** and heterocycle) and lipophilicity (from **Cl** and aromatic rings), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.35**  

This balances the contributions from the polar and non-polar components of the molecule.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with aldehyde (**-CHO**) or ester (**-COO-**) groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., `CCCCCC=O` has -0.887, `O=Cc1ccco1` has -0.803).
   - The molecule `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) has a value of -0.00018234, which is close to zero, but this is an ester with a short chain.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains with polar groups (e.g., aldehydes, esters) tend to have more negative values (e.g., `CCCCCC=O` is -0.887).
   - Branching or aromaticity can modulate the value (e.g., `Cc1ccncc1C` is -0.700).

3. **Ethers (-O-)**: 
   - Ethers alone don't strongly dominate the property, but in combination with carbonyls, they may slightly reduce negativity (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` is -0.116).

4. **Butyl Formate (CCCCOC=O)**:
   - This is an ester with a 4-carbon chain (butyl group) and a formyl group (**-C=O**). 
   - Compared to `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate, -0.00018), butyl formate has a longer chain, which would likely make the property more negative.
   - Compared to `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal, -0.887), butyl formate has an ether oxygen, which might slightly reduce the negativity.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, **butyl formate (CCCCOC=O)** is expected to have a property value between the shorter-chain ester (`CC(=O)OCC`, -0.00018) and the longer-chain aldehyde (`CCCCCC=O`, -0.887). A reasonable estimate would be closer to the aldehyde but less negative due to the ester oxygen. 

**Predicted property value: -0.65** (approximate, based on structural trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The actual property could vary if it depends on other factors not evident from the examples.)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.007073377232951526
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the examples:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **-0.87741653**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.31699404**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.87763655**.
   - **CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (a chlorinated aromatic) has a value of **-0.22874981**.

   Chlorinated aliphatic compounds (non-aromatic) tend to have negative property values, while chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive values. 

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (2 chlorines on a 2-carbon chain) has a value of **-0.87741653**.
   - **ClCCl** (2 chlorines on a 1-carbon chain) is even smaller and simpler, so we might expect a similar or slightly less negative value.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Smaller, more polar molecules (like **ClCCl**) tend to have negative property values in this dataset, as seen with **ClCCCl** and **CCBr** (-0.59064694).

### Prediction for **ClCCl**:
- **ClCCl** is a small, non-aromatic chlorinated molecule, similar to **ClCCCl** but with one fewer carbon. 
- Given that **ClCCCl** has a value of **-0.87741653**, and **ClCCl** is even smaller and more polar, we might expect a slightly less negative value (closer to zero) due to reduced size and increased polarity.
- However, the dataset does not show a clear trend for smaller vs. larger chlorinated aliphatics, so the value for **ClCCl** is likely close to **ClCCCl**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the similarity to **ClCCCl**, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is approximately:
**-0.85** (slightly less negative than **ClCCCl** due to smaller size). 

However, since the dataset does not provide a clear trend for smaller chlorinated molecules, the closest match is **ClCCCl**, so the prediction is:
**-0.87** (similar to **ClCCCl**). 

But considering the simplicity of **ClCCl**, a reasonable estimate is:
**-0.88**. 

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:
**-0.87**. 

### Exact Value:
To match the precision of the examples, the predicted value for **ClCCl** is:
**-0.87741653** (same as **ClCCCl**, as no smaller chlorinated aliphatic examples are provided). 

However, if we assume a slight adjustment for size, a plausible value is:
**-0.86**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most defensible answer is:
**-0.87**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **-0.87**.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.5276368111337978
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, we can predict its property by comparing structural features and trends observed in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) has a value of **-0.51076405**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **-0.00267671**.
   - The addition of alkyl groups (e.g., methyl) to phenol tends to increase the property value (less negative or more positive).

2. **Substitution Patterns**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethyl-substituted phenol (2,6-dimethylphenol or similar). 
   - Alkyl substitutions (especially at ortho/meta positions) generally increase the property compared to unsubstituted phenol.

3. **Other Trends**:
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl) often lead to less negative/more positive values compared to electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol: **-0.51076405**
- Methylphenol (one methyl): **-0.00267671**
- Adding another methyl group (as in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**) would likely further increase the value, but not drastically (since the first methyl already had a large effect).

A reasonable estimate is slightly higher than **-0.00267671**, likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. 

However, looking at **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (which is a different dimethylphenol isomer) with **-0.00267671**, the exact value depends on substitution position. For **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (likely 2,6-dimethylphenol), steric effects might slightly reduce the increase, so a value closer to **0.0** is plausible.

### Final Prediction:
**0.05** (slightly positive, reflecting the net effect of two methyl groups on phenol). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on structural analogies in the dataset.)

**Predicted value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: 0.05**

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.7993739451459048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.97924725** (highly positive)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **-0.88378934** (highly negative)
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **-0.88570899** (highly negative)

   The first molecule has a high positive value, while the other two have highly negative values. The key difference is that the first molecule has a **non-chlorinated phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)** attached, while the others are fully chlorinated or have polar substituents (like -OH).

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: This is a **biphenyl structure with chlorine substitutions** on both rings. 
     - The first ring: **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)** (two chlorines, one in para position)
     - The second ring: **c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (two chlorines, one in meta position)

   This is somewhat similar to **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (which had a high positive value), but with fewer chlorines and no non-chlorinated phenyl ring.

3. **Other Trends**:
   - Molecules with **multiple chlorines** but no other polar groups tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** = 1.00926341).
   - Molecules with **chlorines + polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2)** tend to have **negative property values**.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is a **chlorinated biphenyl** with **no polar groups** (just chlorines). It is most similar to **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.97924725), but with fewer chlorines. 

Given the trend that **highly chlorinated non-polar aromatics have high positive values**, I predict a **high positive value**, but slightly lower than the fully chlorinated example. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.85** (approximate, likely in the range of 0.8 to 0.95 based on the examples). 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**0.87** (similar to the first highly chlorinated example but adjusted for fewer chlorines).

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: 0.87**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.989209189495858
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): **0.9061197**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene): **0.79964377**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): **0.90795843**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (linear alkane): **-0.17388476**

   Branched hydrocarbons (especially with alkenes or aldehydes) tend to have higher property values, while linear alkanes have lower or negative values.

2. **Alkenes**:
   - The presence of a double bond (C=C) often increases the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C** has **0.79964377**, while **CCCCCCCC** has **-0.17388476**).

3. **Branched Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isobutylene), similar to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane with **0.90795843**) but with a double bond. The double bond likely increases the property value slightly compared to saturated branched analogs.

### Prediction for CC=C(C)C:
- The molecule is a branched alkene, structurally simpler than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** but with a double bond. Given the trends:
  - Branched hydrocarbons have higher values than linear ones.
  - Alkenes have higher values than alkanes.
  - The value should be close to **0.8-0.9**, similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C (0.79964377)** and **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (0.90795843)**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **CC=C(C)C** (only 4 carbons with one double bond and branching), I estimate its property value to be slightly lower than the larger branched examples but still in the positive range. 

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data's trends for branching and unsaturation.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.007073377232951526
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) by analyzing trends in the data. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`) tend to have negative property values (around -0.85 to -0.88). 
   - The presence of more chlorines seems to correlate with more negative values.

2. **Small Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **-0.88793359**, which is very negative.
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a highly chlorinated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.16009428**, but this is an outlier due to its complex structure.

3. **Simple Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is simpler than the examples above, with only two chlorines. It is less chlorinated than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, so its property value should be less negative.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Small, polar molecules like `ClCCl` often have moderate property values. The examples suggest that simpler chlorinated molecules (e.g., `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` with one Cl has **0.92005074**) can have positive values, but this depends on other functional groups.

### Prediction for `ClCCl`:
Given that:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (4 Cl) is at **-0.88793359**,
- `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)` (6 Cl) is at **-0.85879359**,
- `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (complex, 8 Cl) is at **0.16009428**,

`ClCCl` (2 Cl) is likely less negative than these. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.7**, leaning toward the middle of the range for small chlorinated molecules.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.0072640586337518
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, particularly the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** with a property value of **1.00726406**, we can infer that the property is likely influenced by the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring. 

The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is very similar to the example above, with the same substituents (three chlorines and one hydroxyl group) but slightly different positions on the benzene ring. Given the structural similarity, the property value should be close to the example. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.01** (approximately, likely in the same range as the example with similar substitution patterns). 

This aligns with the trend where heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds with polar groups (like -OH) tend to have property values around **1.0** in the given dataset. 

Let me know if you'd like further justification or analysis!

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.9952700507641221
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, functional groups, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

### Key Features:
1. **Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups**:  
   - Methoxy (`OCH3`), hydroxyl (`OH`), carbonyl (`C=O`), and ether (`O`) groups. These are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which often increase the property value (as seen in similar molecules like `OCC(O)CO` and `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` with positive values).

2. **Aromatic rings**:  
   - The molecule contains substituted benzene rings (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`), which can contribute to higher property values when paired with polar groups (e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` has a high value of 0.972).

3. **Complexity and size**:  
   - The molecule is large and has multiple fused rings and sugar-like (carbohydrate) moieties. Larger molecules with polar groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` has a high value of 0.986).

4. **Similar examples**:  
   - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 0.3519) is a sugar-like molecule with many hydroxyl groups, similar to parts of this molecule.  
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property = 0.7095) has hydroxyl groups and fused rings, similar to this molecule.

### Prediction:  
Given the abundance of polar groups (OH, OCH3, C=O), aromaticity, and structural similarity to high-value examples, the property value is likely **positive and moderately high**.  

Comparing to similar molecules, a reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.75**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The value likely reflects a combination of polarity, hydrogen bonding, and molecular complexity.)

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.11266773770949734
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocycle with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (`S` and `NN`), similar to some of the provided examples (e.g., `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` with a property of **0.1884038**). Heterocycles with nitrogen often contribute to intermediate or positive property values.
2. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`) attached to the ring, which is electron-withdrawing.
   - An amino group (`NH`) attached to the ring, which is electron-donating.
   These polar groups can influence the property, often increasing it if they enhance molecular polarity or solubility.
3. **Bulky Substituent**: A tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) is present, which is hydrophobic and bulky. Bulky groups can sometimes reduce the property (e.g., by decreasing solubility), but in some cases, they may stabilize certain conformations or interactions.
4. **Thioether Linkage**: The `CS` group is moderately polar and can contribute to the property, though its effect is less predictable than oxygen analogs.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule **Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3** (with a fused aromatic system and amino group) has a high property value of **0.89308257**.
- The molecule **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a nitrogen-rich heterocycle with oxygen) has a lower value of **0.1884038**.
- The molecule **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (with a heterocycle, carbonyl, and tert-butyl) has a value of **0.77454651**, which is relatively high.

Given the presence of the polar `C=O` and `NH` groups, the nitrogen-rich heterocycle, and the tert-butyl group, the property value is likely to be in the **positive intermediate range**, similar to the last example above.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarities and trends in the provided examples, the predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is approximately **0.75**. 

#### Final Answer: **0.75** (rounded to two decimal places for clarity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, bioactivity—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0013346449094190672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify structural patterns that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Not explicitly given, but substituted benzenes provide clues.
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline): -0.65855282
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not given directly, but **CC(C)c1ccccc1** (isopropylbenzene): 0.36316148
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene): 0.94413854
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chlorinated biphenyl): -0.84258048

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**: 0.13948988 (complex ester)
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butanoate): 0.97324168
   - **CCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl pentanoate): 0.97324168
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2**: -0.29192312 (complex ester with additional polar groups)

3. **Phenyl Esters (Ph-COOR)**:
   - The target molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **ethyl benzoate**, which is a phenyl ester with an ethoxy group.
   - The closest analog is **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (-0.29192312), but this has many additional substituents that lower the property value.
   - Simpler esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** and **CCCCC(=O)OC** have values around **0.97**, but these are aliphatic esters.

4. **Aromatic Esters**:
   - The presence of an aromatic ring (benzene) in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** may lower the property compared to aliphatic esters due to conjugation and reduced polarity.
   - The nitrobenzene (**Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) has a high value (0.944), but this is due to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group.
   - The ester group in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group, so the value should be lower than 0.944 but higher than purely aliphatic systems like **CCC(C)(C)CO** (-0.87573291).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Aliphatic esters (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) have values around **0.97**.
- Aromatic systems with no strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1**) have negative values.
- The ester in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is conjugated with the benzene ring, which may slightly reduce the property value compared to aliphatic esters.

A reasonable estimate is between **0.2 and 0.5**. Looking at the examples, **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (a complex ester) has a value of **0.139**, and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (a very complex ester) has **-0.291**. Since **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is simpler, its value should be higher than these.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **0.45**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or additional data would be needed.)

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.21498463137913384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Br-substituted):**
   - **CI (iodomethane):** Property value = **0.69443914**  
     This suggests that simple alkyl halides with a single halogen (I) have a moderately positive property value.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene):** Property value = **0.70831174**  
     Aromatic bromine substitution also gives a positive value, similar to alkyl iodides.

2. **Alkyl Chains:**
   - **CCCCCCCO (heptanol):** Property value = **0.00382969**  
     A long alkyl chain with a polar group (OH) has a near-neutral value.
   - **CCCCCCC=C (1-heptene):** Property value = **-0.34676815**  
     An unsaturated hydrocarbon (alkene) has a negative value.
   - **CCCCCC(=O)C (2-heptanone):** Property value = **-0.17777675**  
     A ketone in the chain reduces the value further.

3. **Bromine Substitution:**
   - The presence of bromine (Br) tends to increase the property value, as seen in **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.70831174)** and **CI (0.69443914)**.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane), structurally similar to **CI (iodomethane)** but with a longer alkyl chain and bromine instead of iodine.
- The alkyl chain itself (without Br) would likely contribute a near-neutral or slightly negative value (e.g., **CCCCCCCO** is **0.00382969**).
- The bromine substitution should increase the value, similar to how **CI** and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** have values around **0.69–0.71**.
- However, the longer alkyl chain may slightly reduce the effect of bromine compared to **CI**, but it should still be positive.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCBr** is:  
**0.65** (slightly lower than **CI** due to the longer alkyl chain but still positive due to Br).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.70831174)**, which is aromatic, and **CI (0.69443914)**, which is a simple alkyl iodide, a linear alkyl bromide like **CCCCCCCBr** would likely be in the same range but slightly lower due to reduced halogen impact in a larger molecule.  

**Final Predicted Value: 0.68**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that halogens, especially Br/I, increase the property value in the given examples.)

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is approximately **0.68**.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8452055169397558
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule **CO (carbon monoxide)** in this context:

1. **CO is a small, linear molecule with a highly polar C≡O triple bond**. It lacks aromaticity or complex functional groups seen in many of the examples.
2. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - Small, non-aromatic molecules with polar bonds (e.g., **CCC (-0.558)**, **CCBr (-0.591)**, **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (0.950)**) show a wide range of values, but CO is even simpler and more polar.
   - Molecules with carbonyl (C=O) or nitrile (C≡N) groups (e.g., **NC#N (0.071)**, **COC=O (-0.876)**) tend to have negative values unless paired with strongly electron-donating or withdrawing groups.
   - CO is more polar than most alkanes but lacks the complexity of nitro/amine/aromatic systems that push values toward extremes.

3. **Key observations**:
   - The most similar example is **CCCCOC=O (-0.876)**, where the aldehyde (C=O) dominates the property. CO is even "purer" in its polar triple bond.
   - Small polar molecules without compensating features (e.g., aromaticity) tend toward negative values in the dataset.

4. **Prediction**: Given CO's high polarity and small size, its value should be **negative and moderately large in magnitude**, similar to other small polar molecules like aldehydes or halocarbons. 

**Predicted property value for CO: -0.85**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend of small, polar molecules in the dataset, likely falling between -0.80 and -0.90.)*
