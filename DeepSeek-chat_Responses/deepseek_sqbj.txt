SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.44162598398903397
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to be influenced by the molecular structure, particularly functional groups and overall polarity/hydrophobicity. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (a long aliphatic chain with an ester group, specifically methyl decanoate), we can compare it to similar structures in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (which appears in the dataset with a value of **-0.43214753** for a shorter chain: **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC**). The longer chain here (10 carbons vs. 8 carbons) would likely make the molecule even more hydrophobic, but the ester group retains some polarity.

2. Other long-chain aliphatic molecules with polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O**, **CCCCCCCC(C)O**) have values around **-0.75**, while purely nonpolar alkanes (e.g., **CCCCCC**) have values closer to zero (e.g., **0.12764727**).

3. The ester group introduces slight polarity, but the long hydrophobic chain dominates. The value is likely slightly more negative than the shorter ester example (**-0.43214753**) but not as extreme as the alcohols (**-0.75**).

Given these observations, I predict the property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** to be:

**-0.50** (approximate, likely between -0.4 and -0.6 based on the trend). 

However, since the exact match for **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is **-0.43214753**, and the longer chain would slightly increase hydrophobicity, a reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (slightly more negative than the shorter ester due to the longer chain). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.5185731158002428
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like scaffold** (a benzene fused to a lactone/lactam-like ring with a carbonyl (=O) and an NH group). This is somewhat similar to the structure **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.58232051), which also has a cyclic carbonyl and heteroatoms (S/N). However, the current molecule has an aromatic ring fused to a heterocycle, which may influence the property differently.
2. **Substituents**: A **chlorine (Cl)** is attached to the benzene ring. From the examples, chlorinated aromatics like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property: -0.73762031) and **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: 3.88838796) show that Cl substitution can lead to either negative or positive property values depending on the rest of the structure. Here, the Cl is likely to contribute a modest negative effect.
3. **Functional Groups**: The **lactam-like (oc(=O)[nH])** group is electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: -0.72931857). This suggests a negative contribution to the property.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.58232051) has a similar cyclic carbonyl/heteroatom motif but lacks aromaticity. Our molecule's aromaticity might slightly increase the property (less negative).
- The molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: -0.72931857) has multiple carbonyls/amides, leading to a more negative value. Our molecule has only one such group, so the property should be less negative.
- The molecule **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property: -0.73762031) has multiple Cl substitutions, which our molecule lacks, so our property should be less negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the aromaticity (slightly positive contribution), the Cl substitution (modest negative), and the lactam-like group (negative), the property is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other cyclic carbonyl/heteroatom systems but less extreme than highly chlorinated or multi-carbonyl examples.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property: -0.55**  

This aligns with the trends observed in the examples for similar structural motifs.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9578089227849126
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **-0.17824767**.
   - Nitro groups tend to introduce polarity and can lower the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures.

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**) have values around **0.12764727**.
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)CC**) have slightly negative values (e.g., **-0.74756739**).

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature and the branched alkyl group (**CC(C)**) suggest a balance between slight hydrophobicity (from the alkyl group) and polarity (from the nitro group).

### Comparison:
- The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is structurally simpler than **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** but shares the nitro functionality. The absence of additional heteroatoms or rings may result in a less negative value than **-0.17824767** but still negative due to the nitro group.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.15** (slightly less negative than the heterocyclic nitro example due to the simpler structure).

However, looking more closely at the examples, the nitro group's impact seems to vary, but the closest analog is **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** with **-0.17824767**. Since **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is less complex, its value might be slightly higher (less negative). 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.12** (rounded to two decimal places). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.12**

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 5.505289723889479
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as ring systems, halogen substitutions, and polar groups. The molecule in question is a complex steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group. 

Breaking it down:
1. The molecule has a **steroid core** (multiple fused rings), which is similar to the molecule `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property value: **5.88426407**). This suggests that the steroid backbone contributes significantly to the property value.
2. It includes **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and a **carbonyl group (C=O)**, which are polar and can influence the property.
3. The presence of **C(=O)CO** (a carbonyl with an alcohol tail) may slightly reduce the property compared to a simpler steroid with just a carbonyl.

Comparing to similar structures:
- The steroid-like molecule `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` has a value of **5.88426407**.
- The molecule here has additional polar groups (OH, C(=O)CO), which might slightly lower the value due to increased polarity or steric effects.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` would be slightly lower than **5.88426407**, but still in the same range due to the dominant steroid backbone. 

**Predicted property value: ~5.6** (e.g., **5.62** as an estimate). 

(Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.9100497180611389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), similar to many examples in the dataset (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, CN(C)c1ccccc1).
2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Two **amide groups (C(=O)N)**, which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - **Fluorine and chlorine substitutions**, which add electronegativity and influence polarity.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is moderately large with multiple functional groups, comparable to examples like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 (property = 2.287) or C=CCS(=O)SCC=C (property = 0.958).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.179) and **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = -0.179): Simple halogenated aromatics with low values.
- **CN(C)c1ccccc1** (property = -0.659): Aromatic with polar substituents (N-dimethyl).
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.668): Contains amide, aromatic, and phosphoryl groups, somewhat similar to our molecule.
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (property = -0.739): Contains a thiourea group attached to an aromatic ring.

Our molecule has **two amide linkers** and **halogenated aromatics**, which likely increase polarity but are balanced by the aromaticity. The presence of **two amides** suggests a higher value than simple halogenated aromatics but lower than very polar or large molecules like steroids (e.g., CC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O)C(=O)COC(C)=O, property = 4.818).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to moderately polar aromatic compounds with amide/halogen substituents, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 0.5** (between the values for simple halogenated aromatics and more complex polar molecules). 

This aligns with examples like:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = 0.452),  
- **C=CCS(=O)SCC=C** (property = 0.958),  
- **CCC(C)(C)O** (property = 0.435).  

Thus, the predicted value is **~0.5**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.5**

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.741573374943511
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Ethers**:
   - **CCCCCO** (pentanol): Property value = **0.12764727**
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): Property value = **1.90159447**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon): Property value = **1.10900717**
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate): Property value = **-0.28507689**
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (branched alcohol): Property value = **1.77913719**

   Ethers (e.g., **CCOC(=O)CC**) tend to have slightly negative or low positive values, while branched alcohols/hydrocarbons have higher positive values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Ethers (**R-O-R**) generally have lower values than alcohols (**R-OH**), as seen in the examples.
   - The presence of branching tends to increase the property value (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** vs. linear chains).

3. **Specific Structure of CCCOC(C)C**:
   - This is an ether (**isopropoxypropane**) with a branched (isopropyl) group and a short linear chain (propyl).
   - Compared to **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate, value = **-0.28507689**), this molecule lacks the carbonyl group but has branching, which may increase the value slightly.
   - Compared to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (value = **1.90159447**), this molecule has an ether linkage instead of an alcohol, which would likely reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given the ether linkage and the branched structure, the property value is likely to be in the low-to-moderate positive range, similar to or slightly higher than **CCOC(=O)CC** but lower than branched alcohols. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C: 0.35**

This is based on:
- Ethers typically having values around **-0.3 to 0.5**.
- Branching increasing the value slightly (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** = 1.109, but without the alcohol group, the effect is smaller).

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**0.35** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 3.1364567706506277
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often contributes to lower property values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of `-0.75236754`).
   - It has a **hydantoin-like core** with two carbonyl groups (`C=O`) and an `[nH]` (imidazole-like nitrogen), which can introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.
   - The **tertiary butyl group (CCC(C))** is bulky and hydrophobic, which may offset some polarity.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Br** and **Cl** substituents tend to have negative or low-positive values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` is `-0.17974352`, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is `-0.75236754`).
   - Molecules with **polar cores** (e.g., amides, heterocycles) but no strong electron-donating groups often fall in the range of `-0.7` to `0.7`.
   - The presence of **two carbonyls** and **Br** suggests a value closer to the lower end of this range.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc1nccs1` (a polar heterocycle with no strong substituents) has a value of `-0.11426353`.
   - `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` (polar, halogenated heterocycle) is `-0.68615672`.
   - The given molecule is more polar than these due to the additional carbonyl and Br, but the bulky alkyl group may mitigate this slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of **polarity (Br, C=O)** and **hydrophobicity (tertiary butyl)**, the property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other halogenated polar heterocycles. 

**Prediction: `-0.55`**  
*(Rationale: Closer to `-0.68615672` but slightly less negative due to the bulky alkyl group.)*  

---  
*Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity), this is an empirical estimate based on structural trends in the data.*

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.33111282573097417
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule (biphenyl, `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`), I can predict the property value based on the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) tend to have higher positive values (1.46992411 in this case). However, simpler fused aromatics like `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` have lower values (0.1367155). Biphenyl is a simpler aromatic system with two connected benzene rings but lacks extensive fusion.

2. **Substituents**: The presence of electronegative or bulky substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl, Br) often increases the property value (e.g., `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O` has 2.21805807). Biphenyl has no substituents, so this effect is absent.

3. **Conjugation**: Biphenyl has conjugation between the two rings, but this is less extensive than in fused polycyclic aromatics. The property value is likely modest.

4. **Similar Examples**:
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (large fused aromatic): 1.46992411.
   - `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (smaller fused aromatic): 0.1367155.
   - `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (two fused rings with a methyl): -0.67195749.
   - `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (non-fused aromatic with aliphatic ring): -0.18385802.

Biphenyl is closer to `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (non-fused but aromatic) but with more conjugation. Its value is likely slightly higher than -0.18385802 but lower than 0.1367155 (fused case).

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.05** (modest positive value due to conjugation but no fusion or substituents). 

(Note: The exact property is unclear, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the trend.)
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.9414606609024078
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol), which is a simple aliphatic thiol with a linear carbon chain and a terminal sulfur (thiol) group.

From the examples:
- Small aliphatic molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** with a hydroxyl group) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 3.254).
- Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC1CCCCC1**) have moderate positive values (e.g., 1.385).
- Molecules with sulfur (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**) can have very high values (e.g., 10.750), but this is a complex thiophosphate.
- Thiols or sulfur-containing aliphatics (e.g., **CCCCS**) are likely to have a moderate positive value due to the polarizable sulfur, but not as high as complex thiophosphates.

Given the simplicity of **CCCCS** and its similarity to other small aliphatics, I predict a **moderate positive value**, likely in the range of **1.0 to 2.0**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCS: 1.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.7791371855385318
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (-OH)**: 
     - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` has a value of **1.77913719** (branched alcohol).
     - `CC(C)CC(C)O` has a value of **-0.43578869** (less branched alcohol).
     - The presence of an -OH group seems to increase the property value, especially in more branched or sterically hindered structures.
   - **Branched Alkanes**:
     - `CCC(C)(C)C` has a value of **0.43509232**.
     - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` has a value of **1.10900717** (more branching increases the value).
   - **Ethers (-O-)**: 
     - `CCCCOC` has a value of **0.12764727** (linear ether).
     - Ethers seem to have moderate values, but branching or additional functional groups can influence this.

2. **Structure of CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a **branched alcohol** with a primary -OH group and significant branching (tertiary carbon adjacent to the -OH).
   - Similar to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (value = 1.77913719), but with a slightly less hindered -OH (primary instead of secondary).
   - The branching (`(C)(C)`) is similar to `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (value = 1.10900717), but the -OH adds to the property value.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The molecule is most similar to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (value = 1.77913719) but with a primary -OH instead of secondary. Primary alcohols tend to have slightly lower values than secondary alcohols in the examples (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O` is -0.43578869 vs. `CCCC(C)(O)CC` at 1.77913719).
   - The branching is extensive, which generally increases the value (as seen in `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` at 1.10900717).

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** should be slightly lower than `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (1.77913719) but higher than `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (1.10900717) due to the primary -OH and branching. 

A reasonable estimate would be around **1.4 to 1.6**. 

### Final Answer:
**1.5** (approximate interpolated value based on similar structures).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.6861136460103715
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings like benzene (**c1ccccc1**) have a property value of **-0.29371053**.
   - Adding methyl groups to benzene (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**) increases the property value to **0.89596863**, suggesting alkylation raises the property.
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**) have a lower value (**-0.56611382**), likely due to increased conjugation or steric effects.

2. **Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.45413381**.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** (toluene-like) has a value of **-0.17974352**, while **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (dimethyl-substituted) has a higher value (**0.45215791**).

3. **Fused Rings with Methyl Substitution**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (1-methylnaphthalene). 
   - Comparing to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (which is likely 2-methylnaphthalene, value = **-0.45413381**), the property for 1-methylnaphthalene might be slightly higher due to less steric hindrance.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Methyl substitution on naphthalene tends to give values around **-0.45 to -0.30**.
- The 1-position (less sterically hindered) might have a slightly higher value than the 2-position.

Thus, for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (1-methylnaphthalene)**, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This is slightly higher than the 2-methylnaphthalene example (**-0.45413381**) but still in the same range for methylated fused aromatics.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.16058224645051244
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a hydantoin-like core (two amide groups attached to a 5-membered ring, **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1**), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **-0.44575662**), but with a bulkier substituent (**C(C)CCC** instead of just **C**).
   
2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a branched alkyl chain (**C(C)CCC**) and an alkenyl group (**CC=C**). The alkyl chain increases hydrophobicity, while the alkenyl group adds slight polarity. 

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **-0.44575662**). The additional **C(C)CCC** substituent here is more hydrophobic than the single methyl group in the reference molecule, which would likely decrease the property value further (more negative).
   - Another similar molecule is **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2** (property = **-0.27012887**), which has conjugated alkenes and phenolic groups. Our molecule lacks aromaticity and phenolic groups but shares the **CC=C** motif, suggesting a moderately negative property.

4. **Polarity and Size**: 
   - The molecule is larger and more hydrophobic than **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** but lacks strongly polar or aromatic groups that would increase the property value (like in **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1**, property = **0.96574005**).

### Prediction:
Given the increased hydrophobicity from the **C(C)CCC** group and the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**, the property value should be slightly more negative than **-0.44575662**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.5 to -0.7**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is **-0.55**. 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples, where larger hydrophobic substituents decrease the property value relative to simpler analogs.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings with non-polar substituents (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1CC**, **Cc1ccccc1C**) tend to have property values around **-0.4 to -0.7**.
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, carbonyls) often lower the property further (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** at **-0.179**, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** at **-0.753**).

2. **Fluorine Substituents**: 
   - Fluorine is highly electronegative and tends to reduce the property value more than other halogens (e.g., **Cl**-containing molecules are less negative than expected for **F**).
   - The **CF3** group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely further decreases the property.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (di-halogenated benzene) has a value of **-0.179**.
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has **-0.753**.
   - The **CF3** group is more electron-withdrawing than **Cl**, but the molecule is simpler (only one substituent), so the effect may not be as extreme as in heavily halogenated cases.

### Prediction:
For **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**, the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the **CF3** group suggests a property value more negative than simple alkyl-substituted benzenes but less extreme than heavily halogenated systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This aligns with trends for moderately polar aromatic systems with one strongly electron-withdrawing group.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.7066841243270217
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular **polarity, hydrogen bonding capacity, or hydrophilicity**, as molecules with more hydroxyl groups (`-OH`) or other polar functional groups tend to have higher values. 

The molecule in question is:  
**OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**  

This is a sugar-like molecule (a hexose derivative, similar to glucose or fructose) with **five hydroxyl groups (`-OH`)** and an ether oxygen in the ring. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:  
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (linear sugar alcohol, 6 `-OH` groups) has a value of **8.78202813**.  
- Other polyhydroxylated molecules (e.g., steroids with 1-2 `-OH`/`=O`) have values around **4.9–5.8**.  

The cyclic structure of **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** slightly reduces flexibility compared to the linear example but retains strong hydrogen bonding. Thus, its value should be **slightly lower than 8.78** but still high.  

### Predicted property value:  
**~7.5** (estimated range: 7.0–8.0)  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is based on the trend that more `-OH` groups → higher values in the given data.*

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 5.955632357496054
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, halogens, etc.). The molecule in question is a complex steroid-like structure with multiple functional groups:

**Molecule:**  
`CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`

### Key Features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O):**  
   - Acetate (`CC(=O)O-`) and ketone (`C=O`) groups contribute negatively to the property (based on examples like `CCCCC(=O)CCCC` with a low value).
2. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH):****
   - The presence of hydroxyl groups (e.g., `C3(O)` and `C(O)`) tends to increase the property significantly (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a high value of 8.78).
3. **Conjugated double bonds (`C=CC=C`):**  
   - These may slightly decrease the property (similar to aromatic systems like `c1ccncc1` with negative values).
4. **Steroid backbone:**  
   - Bulky, hydrophobic frameworks (e.g., `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2`) tend to have moderate negative values, but hydroxylation can override this.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of **6.91399228** (similar structure with fewer polar groups).  
- `OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O` (highly hydroxylated) has a value of **6.07040931**.  
- The current molecule has **more hydroxyl groups** than the first example but fewer than the second, and it includes additional carbonyls.

### Predicted Property Value:
Balancing the effects of hydroxyls (increasing) and carbonyls (decreasing), the predicted value is likely **between 6.0 and 7.0**, closer to the first example due to the steroid backbone's dominance.  

**Final Prediction:** **~6.5** (specific estimate: **6.4**).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)*

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 6.300741027072325
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, polar groups, and halogen substitutions. The molecule in question is:

**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Steroid-like framework**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes, with fused cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A ketone (`C=O`) group.
   - A hydroxyl (`OH`) group.
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and highly branched, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7` with a value of 7.8143516).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with multiple rings and polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl or ketone) tend to have higher property values. For example:
  - `OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7`: 7.8143516 (complex multi-ring with polar groups).
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`: 5.37030618 (steroid-like with hydroxyl groups).
- The presence of the ketone and hydroxyl groups in the query molecule suggests a similar trend.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (value: 5.37030618) but with slightly less aromaticity and additional ring complexity, the property value is likely in the same range but slightly lower. 

**Predicted property value: 4.8** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7085403495603437
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring with nitro group (-NO2)**: The presence of a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**) is seen in the examples with values around **-0.353** (for a simple nitrobenzene) and **0.196** (for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, where a methoxy group is also present). The nitro group tends to contribute negatively or modestly to the property unless paired with other strongly polar or bulky groups.
   
2. **Amide group (-NHC(=O)CH3)**: The amide group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds. In the examples, amides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1**) have values around **0.339**, while **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** has a high value of **3.198** due to additional nitro and aromatic stacking effects. The amide here is simpler, likely contributing modestly.

3. **Substitution pattern**: The molecule is a para-substituted benzene with an amide and a nitro group. Para-substitution can lead to additive or competing electronic effects. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, while the amide is moderately electron-donating (via resonance), but the net effect is likely dominated by the nitro group.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**: Simple nitrobenzene, value = **-0.353**.
- **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Nitroanisole, value = **0.196** (methoxy is electron-donating, slightly increasing the property).
- **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2**: Complex amide + nitro, value = **3.198** (much higher due to additional aromatic and steric effects).

In **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, the amide is less bulky than in the last example, and the nitro group is the dominant feature. The property is likely between the simple nitrobenzene and nitroanisole, but closer to the former because the amide is not as strongly electron-donating as a methoxy group.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.1 to 0.3**, balancing the modest positive contribution of the amide against the negative contribution of the nitro group. Given the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.245** (similar to **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23**, which has an amide and aromatic nitro-like features). 

This aligns with the structural intuition that the amide slightly offsets the nitro group's effect, leading to a low positive value.

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.5692441056628988
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**

This molecule has the following features:
1. A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))** – this is a polar and moderately complex functional group, often contributing to higher property values (e.g., similar to sulfides or phosphates in the examples).
2. A **thioether linkage (SC)** – sulfur-containing groups (like in CSSC, which has a high value of 2.595) tend to increase the property value.
3. A **chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc)** – halogens (Cl, Br) can increase or decrease the value depending on context, but here it is part of a fused heterocyclic system.
4. A **fused heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2...)** – lactam-like structures (e.g., C=O in a ring) often contribute to higher values (similar to some of the complex polycyclic examples).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- **CSSC** (disulfide) has a value of **2.595**.
- **Cl-containing aromatic systems** vary but often fall in the range of **-0.5 to 1.5**.
- **Phosphorothioates** are not directly in the examples, but phosphoryl/sulfur groups likely increase the value.
- The fused heterocycle with C=O resembles some of the mid-range examples (~0.5–3.0).

### Predicted value:
Given the combination of **P(=S)**, **S-alkyl**, **Cl-aromatic**, and **fused heterocycle**, this molecule is likely in the **higher mid-range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: ~2.8**  

This aligns with the trend where sulfur and phosphorus-containing groups, along with aromatic systems, elevate the value compared to simpler hydrocarbons.

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.4350923242352761
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -0.75004452  
     (branched alcohol with a long alkyl chain)
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.5524486  
     (branched alcohol with a shorter alkyl chain)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: 8.78202813  
     (polyol with multiple -OH groups, very high value)
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is structurally similar to **CC(C)CO** but with more branching (tert-butanol vs. isopropanol).

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to reduce the property value slightly compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCC** has a very high value of 6.35374385, while branched alcohols have negative values).
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO**, so its value may be slightly lower.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO**: -0.5524486  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is expected to have a similar or slightly lower value due to increased branching.

### Prediction:
Given the trend that increased branching in alcohols correlates with slightly lower property values, **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) should have a value slightly lower than **CC(C)CO** (-0.5524486). 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: -0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.06616090825837298
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule is a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (imidazole and pyrimidine-like). It resembles purine-like structures but with additional carbonyl (=O) and NH groups.
2. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Carbonyl (C=O) group at position 1.
   - Multiple NH groups (hydrogen bond donors/acceptors).
   - Nitrogen-rich (high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding).
3. **Aromaticity**: The system is aromatic, which typically contributes to lower hydrophobicity (negative property values in the given examples).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = 1.497): This is a similar pyrimidine-like structure with a carbonyl and NH group. The property is positive but modest.
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 1.087): Another nitrogen-rich heterocycle with a carbonyl, showing a positive value.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.739): A nitrogen-rich fused ring without carbonyl/NH, showing a negative value.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (property = -0.027): A carbonyl-rich non-aromatic system, near zero.

### Key Observations:
- Nitrogen-rich aromatic systems with carbonyl/NH groups tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 1.497, 1.087).
- Lack of such polar groups leads to negative values (e.g., -0.739).
- The given molecule has **more hydrogen-bonding capacity** than most examples, likely pushing the value higher.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity and resemblance to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (1.497) but with even more hydrogen-bonding sites, the property should be **higher than 1.497**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.85**  
(Justification: Similar to the 1.497 example but with enhanced polarity due to additional NH groups.)

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7035458645550379
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Esters/Acids/Alcohols**:
   - **CC(=O)OC(C)(C)C** (an ester) has a value of **6.04664834** (relatively high).
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester) has a very high value of **7.65858823**.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** (an ether) has a low value of **-0.74157337**.
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a slightly positive value of **0.19932215**.

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - Compounds with **C=O** (carbonyl) groups tend to have higher values if they are esters or ketones (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...** has **6.04664834**).
   - Aldehydes (e.g., **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1**) have moderately negative values (**-0.57532552**).

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is an ester (like **CC(=O)OC(C)(C)C**), but smaller and simpler.
   - Esters generally have higher values than ethers or alcohols, but smaller esters may not be as high as larger or more complex ones.

4. **Other Trends**:
   - Branching (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**) tends to give slightly positive values (**0.43509232**).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) can increase or decrease the value depending on context.

### Prediction for **CC(C)OC=O**:
- It is a small ester with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl). 
- Compared to **CC(=O)OC(C)(C)C** (value **6.04664834**), this is a simpler ester, so the value should be lower but still positive.
- Compared to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, **0.19932215**), the ester should have a higher value due to the carbonyl group.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is around **1.5 to 3.0**. 

### Final Prediction:
**2.5** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 2.8001556827958844
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with simple aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) or halogenated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 2.459 for hexachlorobenzene).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**) or polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1**) often have negative property values.

2. **Amides and Ureas**:
   - Amides (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**) and ureas (e.g., **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**) tend to have negative or near-zero property values.
   - The presence of **N-C=O** (amide) or **N-C(=O)-N** (urea) groups seems to correlate with lower property values.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - Symmetrical molecules (e.g., **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**) with conjugated systems may have property values closer to zero or slightly negative, as conjugation can stabilize the molecule and reduce the property value.

4. **Specific Examples**:
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (nicotinamide): Property = -0.353
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1**: Property = -0.687
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**: Property = 0.106 (urea-like, slightly positive)

### Prediction for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**:
This molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea core (**N-C(=O)-N**). Given the trends:
- Urea/amide-like structures tend to have property values in the range of **-0.7 to 0.1**.
- The symmetrical aromatic substitution (two phenyl groups) may stabilize the molecule, pushing the property value toward the lower end of this range.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present, so the value is unlikely to be highly negative or positive.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.45** (approximately midway between typical amide/urea values, accounting for symmetry and aromatic stabilization). 

This aligns with examples like:
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1**: -0.687 (amide with aromatic substitution)
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**: 0.106 (urea with aliphatic substitution).

Thus, the predicted property for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is:  
**-0.45** (estimated). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on extrapolating trends from the given data. If the property is logP, solubility, or another specific metric, the reasoning might differ slightly.)

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.2140009281571558
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to be related to molecular descriptors such as **logP (partition coefficient)** or a similar physicochemical property, given the range of values and the trends observed with functional groups and molecular complexity.

### Analysis of the given molecule: **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**
This is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused rings (two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring). 

#### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - Simple benzene (`c1ccccc1`) derivatives often have values around **-0.7 to 0.0** (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1` = -0.682, `Fc1cccc(F)c1` = 0.0).
   - Larger fused aromatic systems tend to have higher values (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` = 0.900, which is a larger PAH).
2. **Fluorene-like structures**: 
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH) has a value of **0.900**.
   - Fluorene is smaller but has some aromatic conjugation and rigidity, so its value should be between simple benzenes and larger PAHs.

#### Prediction:
Fluorene is more hydrophobic than benzene but less so than larger PAHs. Given the examples:
- Benzene-like: ~ -0.7 to 0.0
- Larger PAHs: ~ 0.9
- Fluorene likely falls in the middle, around **0.5 to 0.8**.

A reasonable estimate is **0.7**, considering its intermediate size and aromaticity.

### Final predicted property value: **0.700**

Iteration: 24
SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.12269288004060708
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: An electron-rich aniline derivative (polar, hydrogen-bonding).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple hydrogen bond donors (NH, NH2) and acceptors (SO2, N), making it highly polar.
   - Sulfonamides and guanidine groups are strongly polar and often increase solubility or interaction properties.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides or polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, property = 0.645) tend to have moderate positive values.
   - Highly polar/charged groups (e.g., **CNN**, property = 6.354) can lead to very high values, but this is an outlier.
   - Aromatic sulfonamides with additional polar groups (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, property = -0.630) can have negative values, but this lacks the guanidine-like group.

4. **Expected Property**:
   - The combination of guanidine-like (basic) and sulfonamide (polar) groups suggests a higher polarity than simple aromatic sulfonamides but not as extreme as **CNN**.
   - Likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**, similar to other polar sulfonamide-containing molecules in the dataset.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.85**  

This balances the contributions of the polar sulfonamide and guanidine-like groups while aligning with the trends in the provided examples.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 5.447090583974068
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electronic effects (e.g., presence of nitro groups, halogens, aromatic systems, and hydrogen bonding). The molecule in question is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: These are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which typically lowers the property value (as seen in similar nitro-containing examples like `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` with a value of -0.0325989).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is also highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, further lowering the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This introduces some basicity and steric bulk, but the electron-withdrawing effects dominate.
4. **Aromatic system with substitutions**: The substitutions are highly polar and electron-deficient, which reduces the property value compared to simpler aromatics (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has -0.21974714).

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (0.67870338): This has a nitro group and complex heterocycles, but the property is higher due to less extreme electron withdrawal and more balanced structure.
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-0.0325989): Simpler nitro-aromatic with a modest value.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` (-0.74614633): Electron-withdrawing groups and steric bulk lead to a low value.

### Prediction:
The combination of **two nitro groups** and a **trifluoromethyl group** on an aromatic system, along with the steric bulk of the amine, suggests a **strongly negative property value**. The closest analogs (nitro-aromatics) have values in the range of -0.7 to 0.0, but the additional electron-withdrawing effects here push it lower.

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend of increasing electron-withdrawing groups leading to lower values in the given examples.)*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7035458645550379
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (OH)**: Generally have negative to moderately positive values (e.g., CCCC(C)O = -0.753, OC1CCCCCC1 = 1.102).
   - **Esters (COOR)**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 = -0.747, CCCCCOC(=O)C = -0.686).
   - **Aldehydes (CHO)**: The presence of C=O (aldehyde) often gives moderately negative values (e.g., CC(=O)N = -0.714, CC(=O)C = -0.673).
   - **Ethers (OR)**: Can vary but often negative (e.g., CC(C)SC(C)C = -0.435, COC(=O)c1cccnc1 = -0.652).

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - Branching (e.g., CC(C)O) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., CCCC(C)O = -0.753 vs. CCC(C)(C)O = 0.435).
   - Smaller molecules with polar groups (e.g., ClC(Cl)Cl = 0.199) can have higher values than larger nonpolar molecules.

3. **Specific Example Similarity**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester (methyl ester of a branched carboxylic acid). Similar esters in the dataset:
     - CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 = -0.747
     - CCCCCOC(=O)C = -0.686
     - COC(=O)c1cccnc1 = -0.652
   - The branching (isopropyl group) in **CC(C)OC=O** may slightly increase the value compared to linear esters.

### Prediction:
Given the ester functional group and the branching (isopropyl), the property value is likely in the range of **-0.65 to -0.70**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.68**  

This aligns with the trends observed for similar esters in the dataset, accounting for the slight increase due to branching.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.42010111415071183
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH groups tend to have property values in the range of **0 to 3**, depending on other substituents. For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` has a value of **0.630** (multiple -OH groups).
     - `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` has a value of **2.254** (multiple -OH groups).
     - `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` has a value of **-0.221** (two -OH groups but with a long aliphatic chain).

2. **Methyl Groups (-CH3)**:
   - Methyl groups alone (e.g., `CC(C)C`) have a small positive value (**0.199**).
   - When combined with -OH, the effect seems additive but not drastically high.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a value of **-0.220**.
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (toluene-like) has a value of **0.0** (no -OH).
   - `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (methyl and amino substituents) has a value of **0.0**.

4. **Combination of -OH and -CH3 on Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` has:
     - A methyl group (-CH3) at position 1.
     - Another methyl group (-CH3) at position 3.
     - A hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 4.
   - This is similar to `c1ccccc1O` (phenol, -0.220) but with additional methyl groups. Methyl groups slightly increase the property value (e.g., `CC(C)C` is 0.199 vs. phenol's -0.220).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- Two methyl groups (slightly positive contribution).
- One hydroxyl group (moderate positive contribution, but not as high as multiple -OH groups).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or bulky groups (which could lower the value).

The property value is likely **slightly positive but small**, similar to phenol but adjusted for the methyl groups. 

From the examples:
- Phenol (`c1ccccc1O`): -0.220.
- Toluene-like (`Cc1cccc(C)c1`): 0.0.
- `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1`: 0.630 (multiple -OH).

For `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`, the value is likely between **0.0 and 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.25**, considering the two methyl groups and one -OH.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, likely in the range 0.2 to 0.3).

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.5548166510911011
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate Derivatives (P(=S))**:  
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)** group and aromatic rings (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**, **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**, **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) consistently have a property value of **-0.05784676**.  
   - These molecules share a common substructure: **COP(=S)(OC)O** attached to a substituted phenyl ring.

2. **Substituent Effects**:  
   - The property value seems relatively insensitive to the specific halogen (Cl, Br, I) or substitution pattern on the phenyl ring, as long as the **P(=S)** core is present.  
   - The value **-0.05784676** appears to be a "baseline" for this class of compounds.

3. **New Molecule Analysis**:  
   - The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is structurally similar to the phosphorothioate examples above, with the following differences:  
     - The phenyl ring is substituted with **SC** (thioether) and **C** (methyl) instead of halogens.  
     - The **SC** group is moderately electron-donating, similar to halogens, and unlikely to drastically alter the property.  
     - The **methyl (C)** group is also a weak electron-donor, comparable to halogens in this context.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Since the property value for phosphorothioates with substituted phenyl rings is consistently **-0.05784676**, and the substituents in the new molecule (**SC** and **C**) are not expected to significantly perturb this value, the predicted property should remain close to the baseline.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.05784676** (same as the other phosphorothioate derivatives with substituted phenyl rings).  

This prediction assumes that the property is primarily determined by the **P(=S)** core and the aromatic system, with minor influence from the substituents in this case.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.7376115113950688
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, we can infer the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**:  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **-0.74771043**.  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **-0.63144981**.  
   Both are heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structures with negative property values.

2. **Target Molecule**:  
   The target **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is structurally similar but slightly less chlorinated than the first example above (missing one Cl on the second ring).  

3. **Trend**:  
   - More chlorination tends to decrease the property value (but not strictly linear).  
   - The target’s substitution pattern is intermediate between the two examples.  

### Prediction:  
Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (-0.74771043) but with one fewer Cl, the property value should be **less negative** (closer to zero).  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = -0.68**  

### Rationale:  
- The target is less chlorinated than the first example (-0.747) but more symmetric than the second (-0.631).  
- The value likely falls between these two, leaning closer to -0.7 due to the biphenyl core’s dominance.  

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**-0.68**

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6830894145040554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher property values, especially when attached to aromatic rings. For example:
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (two nitrile groups) has a value of **1.13760522**.
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (three nitro groups) has a value of **1.8893**.
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups) has a very high value of **4.95322412**.
   - However, nitro groups on aliphatic chains (non-aromatic) seem to have less extreme effects. For example:
     - `CCCN(=O)=O` is analogous to the given examples but not directly present. 

2. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is a simple aliphatic nitro compound (nitropropane). From the examples, aliphatic nitro compounds are not explicitly listed, but we can infer:
     - Aliphatic nitro groups are less impactful than aromatic nitro groups.
     - The presence of a nitro group likely increases the property value compared to similar aliphatic molecules without nitro groups.

3. **Similar Aliphatic Molecules**:
   - `CCC` (propane) has a high value of **6.35374385**, but this seems anomalous because other alkanes like `CC` (ethane) have a very high value (**17.0074039**), while `CCCC` (butane) is not listed. This suggests that small alkanes may have high values, but this trend is inconsistent.
   - `CCCCBr` (bromobutane) has a value of **0.12764727**, which is low, suggesting halogens may reduce the property value.

4. **Nitro Group Impact**:
   - The nitro group is electronegative and polar, which likely increases the property value compared to similar molecules without it. For example:
     - `CCCN(=O)=O` vs. `CCC`: The nitro group should increase the value, but not as dramatically as in aromatic systems.

### Prediction for CCCN(=O)=O:
Given that:
- Aliphatic nitro groups are less impactful than aromatic nitro groups.
- The nitro group will increase the property value compared to similar aliphatic chains without it (e.g., `CCC` has **6.35374385**, but this seems anomalously high; other aliphatic chains like `CCCCCCCCO` have negative values).
- The nitro group's effect is likely to place the value in the low positive or near-zero range.

From the examples, the closest analog is `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (a nitro-like group in a non-aromatic system) with a value of **-0.11426353**, but this is a heterocycle. For a simple aliphatic nitro compound, a reasonable estimate would be slightly positive.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **0.5**. 

However, considering the inconsistency in aliphatic examples, a more conservative estimate would be **0.3**. 

But looking at the high value of `CCC` (**6.35374385**) and the moderate impact of the nitro group, a plausible value is **1.0**. 

Given the examples, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.8** (balancing the nitro group's effect and the aliphatic nature). 

However, after re-evaluating, a more precise estimate based on the nitro group's moderate impact is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.6**. 

But to align with the given examples (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` at **1.13760522** for two nitrile groups, which are somewhat similar to nitro in polarity), a value of **0.7** seems appropriate. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 0.7**.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often have negative property values, especially when multiple halogens are present or when combined with other electronegative groups.
   - Example: 
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → -0.17974352 (one Cl and one Br)
     - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl → -0.69405867 (multiple Cl)
     - BrC(Br)Br → 0.19932215 (three Br, but small molecule)
     - CC(C)Br → 0.19932215 (similar to BrC(Br)Br, but with alkyl group)

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - Monosubstituted aromatic rings with halogens tend to have moderately negative values.
     - COc1cccc(Cl)c1 → -0.47929153 (Cl on aromatic ring)
     - COc1ccccc1Cl → -0.27181394 (Cl on aromatic ring)
     - Clc1ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 → -0.51857312 (Cl on aromatic ring with other groups)

3. **Fluorine (F) Substitution**:
   - Fluorine is highly electronegative and tends to lower the property value more than Cl or Br in similar contexts.
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 → -0.75236754 (F on aromatic ring)
   - However, F is less bulky than Cl or Br, so its effect may not be as pronounced in some cases.

4. **Combined Halogens**:
   - When multiple halogens are present (e.g., Cl and Br), the property value tends to be more negative.
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → -0.17974352 (one Cl and one Br)
   - The position of substitution also matters (para-substitution in this case).

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- The molecule is a benzene ring with **F** (fluorine) and **Br** (bromine) as substituents (likely para-substitution, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1).
- Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, so it might lower the property value more than Cl in the same position.
- Bromine is less electronegative than Cl but bulkier, which could also influence the value.

Given that **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **-0.17974352**, replacing Cl with F (more electronegative) would likely make the property value more negative. However, Br is less electronegative than Cl, which might offset some of the effect. 

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would be slightly more negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, but not drastically so. 

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (approximate, considering the balance between F and Br effects).

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property and additional subtle effects.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.11531133612274665
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains with Halogens or Functional Groups**:
   - **CBr**: High value (17.0074039), likely due to the presence of bromine.
   - **CCCCBr**: Much lower (0.94146066), suggesting that longer chains reduce the property value even with bromine.
   - **CCCC(C)(C)O**: Moderate (0.36159397), likely due to the hydroxyl group and branching.

2. **Cyclic Structures with Oxygen or Functional Groups**:
   - **CC1CCCO1**: Relatively high (0.98314095), likely due to the cyclic ether (tetrahydrofuran-like structure).
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: Very high (6.30288326), due to the complex polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen-containing groups (OH, C=O, ether).

3. **Steroids or Polycyclic Structures**:
   - Molecules with fused rings and oxygen functionalities (e.g., steroids) tend to have high values (e.g., 6.30288326, 5.98091556, 3.93462826).

4. **Simple Alcohols or Ethers**:
   - **CC(C)(C)CO**: Moderate (0.43509232), due to the tertiary alcohol.
   - **CCCOCCC**: Negative (-0.29978607), likely due to the simple ether.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**
- This is a **bicyclic structure** with two fused rings (a decalin-like framework).
- It has a **tertiary hydroxyl group (C(OH))** and **quaternary carbons (C(C)(C))**.
- Structurally, it resembles some of the polycyclic molecules in the examples (e.g., steroids) but is simpler.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: Very high (6.30288326), but this is a much more complex steroid with multiple oxygens and a ketone.
2. **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: Extremely high (6.89598258), but this has additional aromatic rings and ester groups.
3. **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: High (3.93462826), but this is a steroid with multiple oxygens.

The target molecule is simpler but shares features (bicyclic, hydroxyl, quaternary carbons) with these high-value examples. However, it lacks additional polar groups (e.g., ketones, esters) that drive values higher.

### Closest Simpler Example:
- **CC1CCCO1**: 0.98314095 (cyclic ether with no additional complexity).
- The target molecule has a more rigid bicyclic structure and a hydroxyl group, which may increase the value slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the bicyclic structure and hydroxyl group, but no additional polar functionalities, a reasonable estimate is:  
**~1.5 to 2.0**.  

A precise prediction based on the examples:  
**1.8**.  

### Final Answer:
**1.8**

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.3086994795126563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable feature, as seen in the example:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **0.48097791**.
   The presence of P(=S) with similar substituents (OCC) suggests a comparable contribution to the property.

2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure, which is also present in the above example. The lactam ring is likely to contribute similarly to the property.

3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**: These are present in both the given molecule and the example, further supporting structural similarity.

### Key Differences:
- The given molecule lacks the **SC(CCl)** group present in the example, which might slightly reduce the property value (as sulfur and chlorine could add complexity/polarity).
- However, the core **P(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** scaffold is nearly identical.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to the example with a property value of **0.48097791**, and accounting for the minor structural simplification (absence of SC(CCl)), the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** would be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.45**  
(A reasonable estimate would be between **0.40 and 0.50**, with **0.45** as a midpoint.) 

### Final Answer:
**0.45**

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.7462032461579974
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Polar Groups**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine) and polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitrogens) tend to have negative property values unless balanced by bulky/aliphatic substitutions.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.23372032) has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and nitrogens.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Carbonyls (especially in amides or ketones) often reduce the property value (e.g., `CCC(=O)C` = -0.66061148, `CCCCCC(=O)C` = -0.69416876).

3. **Nitrogen in Heterocycles**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) tend to lower the property (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` = -0.7147938).

4. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Longer or branched aliphatic chains increase the property (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)C` = 1.90159447).

5. **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Donating Groups**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyls) reduce the property, while electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyls) may increase it.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**  
- Structure: A fused aromatic system with:
  - A carbonyl group (`C=O`) on the ring.
  - Two nitrogen atoms in the ring (one adjacent to the carbonyl).
  - Two methyl groups (`-CH3`) attached to the nitrogens.
  - A benzene ring fused to the heterocycle.

This molecule resembles `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (property = -0.23372032), but with an additional carbonyl and a simpler fused ring system. The carbonyl and nitrogens will likely reduce the property, while the methyl groups may slightly offset this effect.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to other molecules with carbonyls and nitrogens, the property is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: -0.52**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogies; precise prediction would require a quantitative structure-property relationship model.)

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.1035530205797704
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a property value of **0.94146066**.
   - **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan) also has the same value (**0.94146066**), suggesting that simple aliphatic chains (with or without sulfur) tend to have values around ~0.9–1.0.

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate) has a value of **-0.68308941**, but this is an amide-like structure, not a pure ester.
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a value of **0.21929828**, which is positive but lower than aliphatic chains.
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl octanoate) has a value of **-0.43981837**, which is negative but not directly comparable due to the longer chain.

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of **C=O** (carbonyl) in esters tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - The **OCC** (ethoxy) group in **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is similar to **CCOC(=O)N**, but the latter has an amide group, which may further reduce the value.

4. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**) tend to have slightly reduced values compared to shorter ones (e.g., **CCCCC**).

### Prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a 6-carbon aliphatic chain (**CCCCCC**) with an ester group (**(=O)OCC**).
- Compared to **CCCCC** (0.94146066), the ester group will likely reduce the value.
- Compared to **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (0.21929828), this molecule has a longer chain and a similar ester group, so the value might be slightly higher but still positive.
- The closest analog is **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl octanoate, -0.43981837), but this has a longer chain and a methyl ester, whereas **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** has an ethyl ester and a shorter chain. The ethyl ester might slightly increase the value.

### Estimated Value:
Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.35** (specific value: 0.35000000)  

This balances the positive contribution of the aliphatic chain and the reducing effect of the ester group.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.652621767484337
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-0.74813753**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally very similar, differing only by one fewer carbon in the ester group (methyl instead of ethyl). 
   - The property value for ethyl benzoate is already quite low (-0.748), and methyl benzoate might be slightly less negative due to the shorter alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl), but the difference is likely small.

2. **Other Aromatic Carbonyls**:
   - **Cn1ccc(=O)[nH]c1=O** (uracil derivative) has a high value (3.086), but this is due to the presence of multiple hydrogen-bonding groups (NH and C=O).
   - **CC(=O)CC** (methyl ethyl ketone) has a value of -0.332, suggesting simple aliphatic carbonyls are less negative than aromatic esters.
   - **COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1** (a more complex aromatic ester) has a higher value (2.450), likely due to additional functional groups.

3. **General Trend for Simple Aromatic Esters**:
   - Simple aromatic esters (like methyl/ethyl benzoate) tend to have negative property values around **-0.7 to -0.8**, as seen with ethyl benzoate (-0.748) and similar molecules like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (-0.747).

### Prediction:
Given that **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is almost identical to ethyl benzoate (just one less carbon in the ester group), its property value should be very close to **-0.748**. The slightly shorter alkyl chain might make it marginally less negative, but the difference is negligible. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.748**. 

(Note: This is based on the strong similarity to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, which has a value of -0.74813753. The methyl vs. ethyl difference is unlikely to significantly change the value.)

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.7244224317356949
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (butene-like structure): Property value = **-0.69313392**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene-like structure): Property value = **-0.32293068**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): Property value = **-0.68376489**

   These examples suggest that hydrocarbons with double bonds (especially conjugated systems) tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of **-0.3 to -0.7**.

2. **Saturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCCC** (butane-like structures) are not explicitly given, but cyclic saturated hydrocarbons like **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) have a much higher value (**1.69360798**), indicating that saturation increases the property value compared to unsaturation.

3. **Conjugated Dienes**:
   - The molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene) is a conjugated diene, similar to **C/C=C/C** but with extended conjugation. Conjugation typically lowers the property value further compared to isolated double bonds (as seen in styrene vs. propylbenzene).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **C/C=C/C** (less conjugated) has a value of **-0.69313392**,
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, more conjugated) has a value of **-0.32293068** (less negative due to aromaticity),
- **C=CCC=C** is fully conjugated but lacks aromatic stabilization, so its value should be more negative than **C/C=C/C** but not as extreme as highly polar or functionalized molecules.

A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than **C/C=C/C**, so:
**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -0.75** (approximate).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- Non-conjugated **C/C=C/C**: -0.693
- Conjugated but aromatic **C=Cc1ccccc1**: -0.323
- Non-aromatic conjugated diene (**C=CCC=C**) would likely be between these, but closer to the non-conjugated case due to lack of aromatic stabilization. 

Thus, a more precise estimate is:
**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -0.65**. 

However, since **C/C=C/C** is already -0.693 and conjugation typically lowers the value further, the final prediction is:
**-0.72** (similar to the first example, which also has some conjugation). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is **-0.72**.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.19932215019186458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative): Property = -0.63144981
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chlorinated biphenyl): Property = -0.68611365
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated biphenyl): Property = -0.68611365
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (halogenated alkane): Property = 3.25423964
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl): Property = -0.74528648

   Halogenated compounds generally have negative property values, except for **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**, which has a high positive value (likely due to the presence of highly electronegative fluorine and bromine/chlorine in a small, polar molecule).

2. **Brominated Alkanes**:
   - No direct examples of brominated alkanes are given, but **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (bromine + chlorine + fluorine) has a high positive value (3.25423964), suggesting that small, highly halogenated molecules can have elevated property values.

3. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a small, symmetric molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon. Bromine is heavy and polarizable, which may contribute to a higher property value compared to less halogenated or larger molecules.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a high value (3.25423964) due to multiple halogens (F, Cl, Br) in a small molecule. 
- **BrC(Br)Br** is similar but lacks fluorine (which is more electronegative than bromine). However, the three bromines will still contribute significantly to the property.

### Prediction:
Given the high property value for **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** and the trend that small, highly halogenated molecules tend to have higher values, **BrC(Br)Br** should also have a relatively high positive property value, though likely slightly lower than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** due to the absence of fluorine.

### Estimated Property Value:
**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: ~2.5 to 3.0**

For specificity, I will predict:  
**2.85** (interpolating between the high value of **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** and other halogenated compounds). 

However, looking back at the examples, **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a phosphorus-containing compound with chlorines) has a very high value (21.65205758), but this is likely an outlier due to the phosphorus. For purely halogenated small molecules, **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** is the closest, so **BrC(Br)Br** might be slightly lower.

Final prediction:  
**2.75** (a balance between the high halogenation and absence of fluorine). 

But to be more precise, given the lack of exact analogs, I'd lean toward:  
**3.0** (similar to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**, as bromine is also highly polarizable). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 3.0**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.48097790501132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.668). This group often contributes to lower property values due to its bulkiness and polar nature.
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many examples, typically contributing moderately (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** = 0.335).
3. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: Similar to **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O** (property = 1.354), but here it's fused to an aromatic ring, which may reduce the value slightly.
4. **Chlorine substituent (C(CCl))**: Halogens like Cl often lower the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** = 1.542, but with more Cl atoms).
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are polar but not as impactful as halogens or highly conjugated systems.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines features from **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.668) and **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O** (1.354). The phosphorothioate group likely dominates, pulling the value toward the lower range.
- The presence of the aromatic lactam might slightly offset the decrease, but not enough to push it into positive values.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of these features, the property is likely in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 0.12345678** (a placeholder; exact prediction requires more context on the property's nature).  

However, based on the closest structural analog (**COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -0.668), but accounting for the less negative influence of the lactam, a refined guess is:  
**Final predicted value: -0.45**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated interpolation from the given examples.)  

---  
**Answer:** The predicted property value is **-0.45**.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.013193016256986842
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Amide group (N-C=O)**: Present in the fragment **CN(C)C(=O)N**, which is similar to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property = 4.4044163) but with one less N-methyl group.
2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: The **c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)** fragment resembles **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.28236034) or **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (property = -0.11630388).
3. **Heterocyclic fragment (n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C)**: This resembles nitro or other electron-withdrawing heterocycles, which often reduce the property value (e.g., **Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2** has a property of 0.45179364).
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: This is a sterically demanding group, which may slightly increase the property (similar to **CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3**, property = 7.41347792, but less extreme).

### Observations from Examples:
- The presence of **N(C)C(=O)N** (as in **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) gives a high value (4.4044163).
- Chlorine on an aromatic ring tends to reduce the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** = -0.28236034).
- The heterocycle with a carbonyl (oc2=O) may further reduce the value.
- The tert-butyl group could offset some of the reduction.

### Synthesis:
The molecule combines a high-value amide fragment with chlorine and heterocyclic fragments that reduce the value. The net effect is likely a balance between these opposing contributions.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (4.404) but with reducing features (Cl, heterocycle), the value should be lower but still positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: 2.30530413**  
*(This aligns with molecules like CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, which has a value of 2.30530413 and shares some structural similarities.)*

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.25528805062411636
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule consists of two phenol rings (each with an -OH group) linked by an ether bridge (O). Each ring is substituted with chlorine atoms:
- First ring: 2-chloro, 4-hydroxy, 1-ether linkage to the second ring.
- Second ring: 2,5-dichloro, 4-ether linkage to the first ring.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have higher property values when combined with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2). For example:
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: 0.45215791 (one -OH, two -Cl)
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: 2.45925778 (one -OH, four -Cl)
   - The presence of more chlorines increases the property value, especially with -OH groups.

2. **Phenol-like Structures**:
   - Phenols with -OH and -Cl substitutions show positive property values, and the value increases with more -Cl substitutions.
   - Example: **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: -0.26068858 (no -Cl, lower value).

3. **Ether Linkages**:
   - Ether linkages (e.g., -O-) alone do not drastically change the property, but combined with -Cl and -OH, they contribute to higher values.

4. **Symmetry and Multiple Rings**:
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (e.g., biphenyl-like structures) tend to have additive effects from substituents. For example:
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**: -0.69656667 (no -OH, lower value)
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has two phenol rings with -Cl and -OH, which should increase the property value significantly.

### Prediction:
The target molecule has:
- Two phenol rings (each with -OH).
- Three chlorine substituents in total (two on one ring, one on the other).
- An ether linkage connecting the rings.

Given the examples:
- **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (one ring, four -Cl, one -OH): 2.45925778
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (one ring, two -Cl, one -OH): 0.45215791

The target molecule has two rings with three -Cl and two -OH groups. The property value should be higher than **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** but likely less than **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** because it has fewer -Cl substitutions per ring. However, the second ring adds another -OH and -Cl, which should increase the value.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **~1.5 to 2.5**, interpolating between the examples. Given the symmetry and additive effects, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.85** (specific estimate based on structural interpolation). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (four -Cl, one -OH) is 2.459, and **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (two -Cl, one -OH) is 0.452. The target molecule has three -Cl and two -OH, so the value should be closer to the higher end but not as high as 2.459. 

A more precise estimate would be **~1.8**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1.80**

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.6931339204719137
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value for the molecule `CC/C=C\C` (which is the same as `CC=CC` or but-2-ene) can be inferred by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset. 

From the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (but-2-ene, same as `CC/C=C\C` but with different stereochemistry) has a property value of **-0.69313392**.
- `CCCC` (butane) is not in the dataset, but `CCCC(C)C` (2-methylpentane) has a value of **-0.69876259**, and `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (a branched alkane) has a value of **1.10900717**. 

Since `CC/C=C\C` is structurally very similar to `CC/C=C/C` (only differing in cis/trans configuration), and the property values for alkenes and alkanes in this dataset do not seem to vary drastically with small changes in branching or unsaturation, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is likely very close to that of `CC/C=C/C`. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is approximately:  
**-0.693** (rounded to 3 decimal places). 

This matches the value for `CC/C=C/C` in the dataset, as the cis/trans isomerism is unlikely to cause a large shift in this property based on the given examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.12764726816800584
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -F, -Br, -I, -NO2, -C=O, -N=O, -S=O, etc.) tend to have higher (more positive) property values. For example:
   - `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (hexachlorophenol) has a very high value (3.88838796) due to multiple Cl and OH groups.
   - `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (hexachloroethane) has an extremely high value (9.32164888) due to many Cl atoms.
   - `C` (methane) has an unusually high value (43.60970279), which seems anomalous unless this is a special case (e.g., a reference or placeholder).

2. **Hydrophobicity/Nonpolarity**: Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatic rings without polar substituents) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. For example:
   - `CC#C` (propyne) has -0.38754397.
   - `CCCCCCC=C` (1-octene) has -0.68555259.
   - `C1CCCCCC1` (cycloheptane) has 2.02288164, which is an exception (possibly due to ring strain or other factors).

3. **Hybrid Cases**: Molecules with both polar and nonpolar regions (e.g., alcohols, ethers, esters) tend to have intermediate values. For example:
   - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) has 0.19932215.
   - `CC(C)COC(=O)C` (an ester) has -0.11258062.
   - `CCCOCC` (dipropyl ether) is similar to these cases.

### Prediction for `CCCOCC` (dipropyl ether):
- This is a symmetrical ether with two propyl groups. Ethers are moderately polar due to the oxygen atom but are less polar than alcohols (no H-bonding donor).
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `CC(C)COC(=O)C` (an ester) has -0.11258062.
  - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) has 0.19932215 (higher due to -OH).
  - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (an aromatic ester) has -0.74813753 (lower due to aromaticity and ester).
- Dipropyl ether is less polar than isopropanol but more polar than pure hydrocarbons. Its value should be slightly negative but close to zero.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for `CCCOCC` is:  
**-0.15** (approximately).  

This is based on interpolation between similar molecules in the dataset. The exact value may vary, but this is a plausible estimate given the examples.  

(Note: If this property is logP or a similar measure, the value aligns with expectations for a simple ether.)

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 1.4593136208443647
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are hydrophobic and contribute to lipophilicity.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a property value of **6.09485659**. This molecule also has a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, but with an additional heterocyclic group (thiazole) that may increase polarity or complexity.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** has a property value of **6.04924114**. This is a cyclic amide with bulky hydrophobic groups, somewhat similar to our molecule.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two phenyl rings with an aliphatic linker) has a value of **2.75161069**, but lacks the amide group.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the **tertiary amide** and **two phenyl rings** suggests moderate to high hydrophobicity but with some polarity from the amide.
   - The **tert-butyl group** adds steric hindrance and lipophilicity, likely reducing the property value compared to more polar analogs like the thiazole-containing example.
   - The molecule lacks highly polar or charged groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-NO2`, `-COOH`), so the value won't be as extreme as some examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 (6.04924114)** but with slightly less complexity (no fused rings), and the presence of two phenyl rings like **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (2.75161069)**, a reasonable estimate would be between these values. 

However, the **tert-butyl group** and **lack of additional polar groups** suggest a value closer to the lower end of this range. 

**Final Prediction: ~5.5**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, likely in the range of 5.0 to 6.0 due to the bulky hydrophobic groups and amide functionality.)*  

### Exact Prediction:
Given the closest analog is **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 (6.04924114)**, and our molecule is slightly less polar/complex, I predict:  
**Property Value: 5.8**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend of similar structures in the data.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.7523675421458639
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with small substituents (e.g., methyl, halogen) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative/positive.
     - Example: `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (toluene derivative) → **0.89596863**
     - Example: `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (dichlorobenzene) → **0.0**
     - Example: `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` (fluorobromobenzene) → **0.0**
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) often reduce the property value.
     - Example: `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) → **-0.35317254**
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, amino) can slightly increase or decrease the value depending on context.
     - Example: `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C` (dimethylphenol) → **0.45215791**
     - Example: `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (methylaniline) → **-0.17974352**

2. **Amide Groups**:
   - Amides (`-CONH-`) tend to reduce the property value, especially when attached to aromatic rings.
     - Example: `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → **1.45931362** (bulky amide with aromatic rings)
     - Example: `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` → **0.10658976** (cyclic amide)

3. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine on an aromatic ring often leads to slightly negative or near-zero values.
     - Example: `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **-0.17974352**
     - Example: `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` → **0.45215791** (multiple bromines increase value slightly).

4. **Combined Features**:
   - The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** has:
     - An aromatic ring with a bromine substituent (similar to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **-0.17974352**).
     - An amide group (`-CONH-`) attached to the aromatic ring (similar to `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → **1.45931362**, but less bulky here).
     - The amide is likely to reduce the value compared to just a brominated aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends:
- The brominated aromatic ring alone would suggest a value close to **-0.18**.
- The amide group (`-CONH-`) is expected to further reduce the value slightly (but not as drastically as in bulky amides).
- The net effect is likely a value between **-0.3 and -0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-0.42**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6435393776544228
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular structure and substituents. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): **0.26249479**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **-0.60267334**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): **-0.5785916**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): **-0.32293068**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon): **-0.34954803**

   The presence of an aromatic ring with alkyl groups tends to give values in the range of **-0.6 to +0.3**, with simpler alkyl groups (like methyl) giving higher (less negative) values and bulkier or branched alkyl groups giving lower (more negative) values.

2. **Branching in Alkyl Groups**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **-0.5524486**
   - **CC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol): **-0.69876259**
   - **CC(C)CCCO** (branched alcohol): **-0.74157337**

   Branching in the alkyl chain tends to lower the property value (more negative).

3. **Isobutyl Group**:
   The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an isobutyl group (branched 4-carbon chain) attached to a benzene ring. From the examples:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl group) has a value of **-0.5785916**.
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl group) has a value of **-0.60267334**.
   - Branching (isobutyl) is expected to lower the value slightly compared to linear alkyl chains.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Aromatic + linear alkyl (e.g., ethyl) gives ~ **-0.6**.
- Aromatic + branched alkyl (e.g., isopropyl) gives ~ **-0.57**.
- The isobutyl group is more branched than ethyl but less bulky than isopropyl, so the value should be between **-0.6 and -0.57**.

A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.59** (rounded from an interpolated value between the examples).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is approximately **-0.59**.
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3229306793273984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic aldehydes/ketones**: 
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide with a hydroxyl group) has a value of **0.35360788**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (a more complex aromatic diketone) has a value of **0.69492655**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene, highly polar) has a value of **1.01908422**.

2. **Benzene derivatives with polar groups**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole) has a value of **-0.6820098**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.69490258**.
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (a simple polyaromatic) has a value of **0.21400093**.

3. **Aldehyde/ketone contributions**:
   - The aldehyde group (**O=C**) is polar and tends to increase the property value compared to non-polar substituents (e.g., methyl or chloro groups).
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ketone) has a high value of **6.50664475**, but this is due to its large size and multiple functional groups.

### Prediction for **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde):
- Benzaldehyde has a polar aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. Compared to the examples:
  - It is simpler than **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** but lacks the hydroxyl group, which likely reduces the property value slightly.
  - It is more polar than **COc1ccccc1** (anisole, **-0.6820098**) but less polar than **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (**1.01908422**).
  - The aldehyde group is less polarizing than nitro groups but more polar than methoxy.

Given these comparisons, the property value for benzaldehyde is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45** (specific value: **0.4532** if interpolating between similar examples). 

However, looking more closely at **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.3536) and **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (0.6949), benzaldehyde (simpler than both) would likely fall slightly below the midpoint. 

**Final predicted value: 0.35** (closer to the benzamide example but adjusted for simplicity). 

For higher precision, I would estimate **0.40** as a balanced prediction. 

But based on the closest analog (**NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** at **0.3536**), and considering the aldehyde is slightly less polar than the amide+hydroxyl combination:

**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: 0.30** (rounded to match the trend). 

However, given the variability, the most defensible estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.35** (aligning with the benzamide example, adjusted for the aldehyde's polarity). 

### Final Answer:
**0.35** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the provided examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given data trends. The true value could vary slightly, but **0.35** is a reasonable estimate.) 

**Refined prediction: 0.38** (to account for the aldehyde's polarity being between methoxy and nitro groups). 

But sticking to the closest example (**NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** at **0.3536**), the prediction is:

**0.35**.

**Final Predicted Property Value for O=Cc1ccccc1: 0.35**

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 1.794468598913165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the aromatic ring (similar to the first example: `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, which has a value of **0.847**). Nitro groups often contribute positively to the property when attached to aromatic systems.
2. **Two amide (C=O)N groups**: Forms a cyclic diamide (imide-like) structure, which is polar and can influence the property. Similar to cyclic amides in other examples (e.g., `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` with **-0.519**), but here it's part of a more complex heterocycle.
3. **Aromatic system with heteroatoms**: The molecule includes a furan-like ring (`o1`) and a nitro-substituted benzene, which may increase the property value compared to simple aromatic systems.
4. **Overall polarity**: The combination of nitro, amide, and heterocyclic groups suggests high polarity, likely leading to a higher property value.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of the nitro group and cyclic diamide is somewhat similar to `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (value: **1.459**), though the latter lacks the nitro group.
- The nitro-aromatic + polar heterocycle combination is reminiscent of `COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2` (value: **2.414**), though this molecule has additional ether and amide groups.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polar contributions from the nitro group and cyclic diamide, but lacking additional bulky hydrophobic groups, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 1.85**  

This balances the nitro group's positive contribution with the cyclic diamide's influence, placing it between the higher-end examples like `2.414` and mid-range examples like `1.459`.
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 2.751610692049669
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.21974714**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **1.14647044**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This difference in bonding (single vs. double) typically reduces the property value slightly because double bonds (like in azo compounds) often contribute more to certain properties (e.g., conjugation, polarizability).

2. **Impact of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - The presence of two aromatic rings connected via a nitrogen-nitrogen single bond (**N-N**) is less conjugated than an azo group (**N=N**), so the property value should be lower than **1.14647044** but higher than simple aniline (**-0.21974714**).

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1**: -0.21974714 (single aromatic ring with -NH2).
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 1.14647044 (azo compound with two rings).
   - **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should lie between these two values, closer to the azo compound but not as high due to reduced conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but with a single N-N bond, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is likely slightly lower than **1.14647044**. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.8 to 1.0**. 

Looking at the examples, the closest analog is **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (1.14647044)**, and since the single-bonded version is less conjugated, we can adjust downward slightly. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.95** (approximate, based on interpolation from the given examples). 

However, to match the precision of the given data, let's round to **0.936** (a plausible intermediate value between the azo compound and simpler aromatic amines). 

But since the examples suggest a step-like jump for azo vs. single-bonded, and no exact match is present, the most defensible answer is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95** (or **0.936** for more precision). 

Given the lack of an exact match, this is an educated estimate. If forced to pick from the given examples' style, **0.936** is reasonable. 

However, reviewing the data again, **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **1.14647044**, and **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** would likely be slightly lower, so **1.0** is a plausible rounded estimate. 

But to be precise, let's take **90% of the azo value** (since single bond is less impactful than double bond):  
1.14647044 * 0.9 ≈ **1.032**. 

Given the variability in the data, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property value: 1.03**. 

But looking back, the closest simpler analog is **Nc1ccccc1** (-0.219) vs. the azo (1.146), so the single-N-linked version is likely halfway: ~0.5. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.5** (intermediate between -0.219 and 1.146). 

However, the presence of two aromatic rings likely pushes it higher, so **0.8** is more plausible. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.8**. 

(Note: Without a clear trend or model, this is an approximate interpolation. The true value would require a model trained on such data.) 

But reviewing the examples again, the closest is **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (1.146)**, and the single-bonded version is likely ~0.7-0.8. 

Thus:  
**Predicted property value: 0.75**. 

Given the examples, this is the most defensible estimate. 

### Exact Prediction:
After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**0.75**. 

(Note: This is an interpolation based on the given data and chemical intuition. For precise predictions, a model or additional examples would be needed.) 

However, looking back at **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 (0.1367155)**, which has two fused aromatic rings with -NH2, and comparing to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (1.146)**, the single-N-linked version is likely closer to the azo case but not as high. 

Thus, revising to:  
**Predicted property value: 0.9**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll provide the final answer as:  
**Predicted property value: 0.9**. 

But to match the precision of the given data, let's say **0.936** (as a compromise between 1.146 and lower). 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.936**. 

However, the most defensible answer based on the given examples is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.9**. 

(No exact match exists, so this is an estimate.) 

After re-evaluating, the best estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.9**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.9**.

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.2763226386238775
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring). This is a bicyclic system with lactam (cyclic amide) functionalities.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity due to hydrogen bonding capability (N-H and C=O).
3. **Ring Strain**: The 5-membered ring (cyclopentane) fused to a 6-membered ring (cyclohexane) suggests minimal ring strain, but the rigidity may influence the property.
4. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.12832381): This is a similar bicyclic lactam with additional alkyl substituents. The property is slightly negative.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not in the list, but simpler lactams like **O=C1CCCN1** have property = 0.0026481). The additional ring fusion here may slightly increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** but with fewer alkyl groups (less hydrophobicity), the property is likely slightly higher (less negative). The rigid bicyclic system with two amides may push the value toward the low-positive range.

**Predicted Property Value: ~0.15**  
*(This is an educated estimate based on the examples, likely between 0.1 and 0.3.)*  

### Refined Estimate:
Looking closer at the examples, **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (-0.128) is more hydrophobic due to alkyl chains, while **O=C1CCCN1** (0.0026) is simpler. The query molecule is intermediate in complexity, so a value slightly above 0.1 seems reasonable.

**Final Predicted Value: 0.12**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is based on the trend of similar structures in the data.)*

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6382967857504115
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.26249479**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **-0.38333726**.
   - The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to reduce the property value compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution**: 
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** with chlorines at the 4 and 4' positions (para-substituted on both rings). This is more symmetric and less sterically hindered than the heavily chlorinated example above.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The given molecule is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, but with fewer chlorines (only 3 Cl atoms instead of 5). The reduced chlorination suggests a higher property value than **-0.38333726** but likely lower than the simple dichlorobenzene (**0.26249479**).

4. **Biphenyl Core**: 
   - The biphenyl core itself (without substituents) is not in the examples, but fused polyaromatics like **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic) have a value of **1.50562559**. However, chlorination significantly reduces this.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and moderate chlorination of **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, the property value is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than the heavily chlorinated example. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.15**  

This balances the effects of chlorination (reducing the value) and the biphenyl structure (which would otherwise contribute positively). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.7203018994571359
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., alkanes, aromatic rings with alkyl substitutions) tend to have higher positive values. For example:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **1.1569079**
   - **CC45CCC2C(CCC3CC1SC1CC23C)C4CCC5O** (complex steroid-like): **8.58275649**

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO, halogens) often have lower or negative values. For example:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): **-0.32293068**
   - **ClCCCl** (dichloroethane): **2.59522039** (halogens can increase the value, but this depends on context).

3. **Aromatic Systems**: Simple alkyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., toluene, ethylbenzene) have modest positive values:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine): **0.26249479**
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not in the list, but similar to toluidine, likely ~0.2-0.3.

4. **Symmetry/Branching**: More branched or symmetric molecules may have slightly higher values than linear ones.

### Analysis of **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**:
- This is **diethylbenzene**, a simple dialkyl-substituted aromatic with two ethyl groups.
- It is larger and more hydrophobic than toluene or ethylbenzene but lacks polar groups.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **1.1569079** (longer alkyl chain, higher value).
  - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine): **0.26249479** (polar -NH2 reduces value vs. pure hydrocarbon).
  - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): **-0.6820098** (polar nitrogen reduces value significantly).

Since diethylbenzene is purely hydrophobic with no polar groups but smaller than hexylbenzene, its value should be between toluene (~0.2-0.3) and hexylbenzene (~1.16). A reasonable estimate is **~0.6-0.8**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is:  
**0.75** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on typical trends like logP or hydrophobicity.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6177711261093202
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a **sulfonamide derivative** (S(N)(=O)=O) attached to an **aniline ring** (Nc1ccc(cc1)).
   - It has both an **amine group (-NH2)** and a **sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2)**, which are polar and can influence solubility or other properties.
   - The aromatic ring with electron-donating (-NH2) and electron-withdrawing (-SO2NH2) groups may affect the property.

2. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline) has a property value of **-0.28236034**. This is structurally similar but replaces the sulfonamide with a nitro group.
   - **Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O** (a nucleoside-like structure) has a value of **2.07391273**, but this is less relevant due to the sugar moiety.
   - **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (dinitrotoluene) has a value of **1.56627533**, showing that multiple electron-withdrawing groups increase the property value compared to mono-substituted analogs.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is expected to have a higher value than **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** because the sulfonamide group is more polar and bulky than the nitro group.

3. **Trends**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, -SO2NH2) tend to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatics (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1** with **-0.21974714**).
   - The sulfonamide group is more polar than a nitro group, so we expect a higher value than **-0.28236034** (nitroaniline) but less than **1.56627533** (dinitrotoluene).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is approximately:  
**0.5** (with an estimated range of **0.3 to 0.7** based on the examples).  

This accounts for the sulfonamide's polarity being stronger than a nitro group but not as extreme as two nitro groups.  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)*  

**Final Answer**: **0.5** (estimated).

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.25156377893380144
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromaticity and Polycyclic Structures**:
   - Molecules with fused aromatic rings (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) tend to have positive property values. For example:
     - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane, non-aromatic but cyclic): **2.02288164**
     - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (polycyclic aromatic): **0.05723172**
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (large PAH): **1.4169265**
   - Smaller or less conjugated systems (e.g., single benzene rings with substituents) tend to have negative values.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, O, N) often reduce the property value (more negative).
   - Alkyl groups or non-polar substituents (e.g., CH3, C2H5) tend to increase the property value or make it less negative.

3. **Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more conjugated systems (e.g., multi-ring PAHs) generally have higher positive values.

### Target Molecule: **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**
This is a **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)** with four fused benzene rings in a zigzag (phenanthrene-like) arrangement. Its structure is similar to some of the higher-valued examples:
- It is fully conjugated and aromatic.
- It lacks electronegative substituents (no Cl, O, N, etc.), which would otherwise lower the value.
- It is larger than benzene but smaller than some of the highest-valued examples (e.g., **CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C**, which has a value of **7.7322328**).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (5-ring PAH): **1.4169265**
2. **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (4-ring PAH): **0.05723172**
3. **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane, non-aromatic): **1.69360798**

The target molecule is a 4-ring PAH, so its value should be between the smaller PAH (**0.05723172**) and the larger one (**1.4169265**). Given its fully aromatic nature and lack of substituents, it should be closer to the higher end of this range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is:  
**~1.2**

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like **logP**, the value aligns with the hydrophobicity of PAHs.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 2.253648943964699
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and hydrogen bonding potential. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity, which in the examples often correlate with lower or negative property values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has a value of `0.0`, and `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has `-0.70668412`).
2. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings, which are common in the examples but don't strongly correlate with a specific trend.
3. **Ketone (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group may slightly increase the property value, but its effect is context-dependent.
4. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: This is neutral or slightly negative in the examples (e.g., `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23` has `-0.65727663`).
5. **Symmetry and conjugation**: The molecule is conjugated and symmetric, which may stabilize it and lower the property value.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (two -OH groups, simple aromatic): `0.0`
- `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (multiple -OH groups, aliphatic): `-0.70668412`
- `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (multiple -OH, aromatic, ketone): `2.11639055`

The molecule here has more -OH groups than `Oc1cccc(O)c1` but less complexity than `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4`. The ketone and additional aromaticity may slightly raise the value compared to very simple polyhydroxy aromatics.

### Predicted property value:
Given the balance of hydrogen-bonding (-OH) and aromatic/ketone features, a reasonable estimate is **`0.5`**. This is higher than simple polyhydroxy aromatics but lower than more complex polycyclic systems with similar groups. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical guess based on the trend in the provided data.)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 10.173261664589832
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have small-magnitude negative or positive values (e.g., `-0.05784676`).
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of `0.58108674`, suggesting that phosphoryl (P=O) groups with additional electronegative substituents (Cl) may increase the property slightly.

2. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has a value of `-0.35317254`, indicating that amide groups may contribute to negative values.
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has `-0.75236754`, further supporting this trend.

3. **Thioether (S-C) groups**:
   - `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` has `1.08708293`, suggesting sulfur-containing heterocycles may increase the property.
   - `c2ccc1scnc1c2` has `-0.43181493`, indicating variability depending on the rest of the structure.

4. **Combination of P=O, amide, and thioether**:
   - The given molecule `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` combines:
     - A phosphate group (`P(=O)`),
     - An amide (`NC(C)=O`),
     - A thioether (`SC`).
   - Similar molecules (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` with `0.58108674`) suggest phosphoryl groups with electronegative substituents can give small positive values.
   - The amide may pull the value slightly negative, while the thioether could add a small positive contribution.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the phosphate (likely small positive), amide (small negative), and thioether (small positive), the net property value is likely to be a small positive number, similar to other phosphoryl-containing molecules in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: `0.45`**  
(Approximate, based on the closest structural analogs like `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` at `0.58108674` but adjusted slightly downward due to the amide group). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity), this is an empirical guess based on the given examples. The value likely falls in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.5730674520115506
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl-like): Property = **-0.74771043**
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): Property = **0.45215791**
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline): Property = **-0.17974352**
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = **-0.75236754**
   - **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**: Property = **1.91004972**

   Halogenation (Cl, F, Br) seems to have mixed effects, but simple chloroalkenes/arenes tend to have moderately negative or near-zero values unless paired with other functional groups.

2. **Alkenes**:
   - **CCC=O** (butanal): Property = **0.33239204**
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): Property = **-0.68308941**
   - **CC1=CCCCC1** (cyclohexene with methyl): Property = **-0.1401982**

   Simple alkenes (like **C=C**) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.7 to 0.3**, depending on substitution.

3. **Symmetry and Polarity**:
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a symmetric, non-polar molecule (trans-dichloroethene). Symmetric halogenated alkenes in the examples (e.g., hexachlorobiphenyl) have negative values, but smaller molecules like this may be less extreme.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple chloroalkenes (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -0.752) tend toward negative values.
- Symmetric, small halogenated alkenes lack strong polar or functional group contributions, likely placing the property near the middle of the observed range for similar molecules.

A reasonable estimate for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is:  
**Property = -0.25** (approximately between -0.7 and 0.3, leaning slightly negative due to halogenation but not as extreme as heavily substituted cases).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CC1=CCCCC1** (methylcyclohexene, -0.140) and **CCC=O** (butanal, 0.332), **Cl\C=C/Cl** is likely closer to the former but with a slight negative shift due to Cl. Thus:  
**Final Predicted Property = -0.20**.

However, considering the **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol, 0.45) and **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.18), the presence of polar groups (OH, NH2) seems to modulate the effect of Cl. For a non-polar, symmetric dichloroalkene, a value slightly more negative than **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** is plausible:  
**Adjusted Prediction = -0.30**.

### Conclusion:
After balancing these factors, the predicted property for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is:  
**-0.30** (with an expected range of -0.5 to -0.1 based on the examples).

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.29371052985052126
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` (chlorophenol): **0.0**
     - `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline): **-0.6820098**
     - `Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32` (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): **0.19320058**
   - Heteroaromatic rings (containing N, O, or S) often have more negative values. For example:
     - `COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C`: **7.03952083** (complex heteroaromatic with multiple oxygen substituents, outlier)
     - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (heteroaromatic with N and O): **-0.73919224**
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (polyheteroaromatic): **-0.67772243**

2. **Nitrogen in Aromatic Rings**:
   - Pyridine-like structures (single N in a 6-membered ring) are not explicitly present in the examples, but similar heteroaromatics with N tend to have negative values (e.g., `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2`: **-0.73919224**).
   - The presence of N in the ring seems to lower the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Substituents**:
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, OH, NO2) can push the value in either direction, but simple unsubstituted heteroaromatics tend to be negative.

### Prediction for Pyridine (c1ccncc1):
- Pyridine is a simple 6-membered heteroaromatic ring with one nitrogen. It lacks substituents, so its property value should be influenced primarily by the nitrogen's electronegativity and aromaticity.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline, aromatic + N): **-0.6820098**
  - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (polyheteroaromatic): **-0.67772243**
  - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (more complex heteroaromatic): **-0.73919224**
- Pyridine is simpler than these examples, but the nitrogen's effect should place it in the same negative range, likely between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is likely close to **-0.65**. 

**Predicted property value: -0.65** (approximate, based on analogous examples).

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 3.462540556387257
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation (especially chlorine and bromine), and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, ethers, etc.). The property values range widely, from negative values (e.g., -0.7) to very high positive values (e.g., 17.0 for CI). 

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**

### Key structural features:
1. **Hydrogen-bonding groups**: Two hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)`), an amide-like linkage (`Nc2ccnc3`), and an ester (`COC(=O)`). These typically contribute to higher property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a high value of 8.78).
2. **Aromatic systems**: Two aromatic rings (one benzene and one fused heterocyclic system with nitrogen and chlorine). Aromaticity alone doesn't dominate the property (see `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` with -0.59), but substitution patterns matter.
3. **Chlorine substitution**: A chlorine on the aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc23`). Chlorine often increases the property (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` is -0.17, while `ClCCCl` is 2.59).
4. **Polar and conjugated systems**: The ester (`COC(=O)`) and the nitrogen in the heterocycle (`Nc2ccnc3`) add polarity and conjugation, which may increase the property.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (a bis-amide) has a high value of 2.80 due to strong hydrogen bonding and polarity.  
- `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (multiple hydroxyls) has 8.78.  
- `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` (ester + ether + amide) has 0.94.  

The target molecule has more hydrogen-bonding capacity than `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` but less than `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`. The chlorine and nitrogen heterocycle further increase the property.  

### Predicted property value:
Given these features, the property likely falls in the **higher range** but not as extreme as `CI` (17.0) or `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (8.78). A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: ~2.5 to 3.5**  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**3.1** (balancing the contributions of hydrogen bonding, chlorine, and aromatic conjugation).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, boiling point, or a computed descriptor—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.12764726816800584
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.68376489  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): -0.53112061  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): -0.5524486  
   These suggest that longer aliphatic chains tend to have moderately negative property values (around -0.5 to -0.7).

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): -0.1364729  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.33239204  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): 1.3866252  
   The presence of oxygen (especially hydroxyl -OH or carbonyl C=O) tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons. Alcohols (e.g., cycloheptanol) have higher values than ethers/esters.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - Hydroxyl groups (-OH) significantly increase the property value due to hydrogen bonding (e.g., cycloheptanol: 1.3866252).  
   - Ethers/esters have less impact than alcohols.

4. **Chain Length vs. Functional Group**:
   - Longer chains dilute the effect of polar groups, but the -OH group still dominates.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- This is a 5-carbon aliphatic chain with a terminal -OH group (primary alcohol).  
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, 7-carbon ring with -OH, value: 1.3866252), 1-pentanol has a shorter chain and is linear, which may slightly reduce the property value.  
- Compared to **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane, -0.5524486), the -OH group will significantly increase the value.  
- The closest analog is **OC1CCCCCCC1**, but with fewer carbons and linearity, I expect a slightly lower value.  

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **CCCCCO** to be approximately **1.0 to 1.3**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**1.2** (specific value: 1.20000000).  

This balances the positive contribution of the -OH group with the modest negative effect of the aliphatic chain.  

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is **1.20000000**.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.39129308401695495
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with negative property values (e.g., -0.612 for Sc2nc1ccccc1s2, -0.720 for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1).
2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 (-0.752) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (-0.269).
3. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Not directly present in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups like thiophene (Sc2nc1ccccc1s2) have negative values (-0.612).
4. **Heterocyclic ring (CCO1)**: Similar to cyclic ethers or lactones, which often have moderately negative values (e.g., -0.497 for C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O).
5. **Methyl substitution (CC1=)**: Alkyl groups tend to slightly reduce the magnitude of negative values (e.g., -0.730 for CCCCCCCCCCCCCC).

### Observations from examples:
- Molecules with aromatic + amide + polar groups (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC) tend to have moderately negative values (-0.269).
- Sulfur-containing aromatic systems (e.g., Sc2nc1ccccc1s2) have values around -0.6.
- Bulky or complex heterocycles with polar groups can push values toward zero or slightly positive (e.g., 0.694 for O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of an aromatic ring, amide, sulfonyl, and heterocycle, the molecule is likely to have a **moderately negative property value**, similar to other polar aromatic systems. 

Comparing to the closest examples:
- **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (-0.752) has an amide + aromatic ring.
- **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** (-0.612) has a sulfur-containing aromatic system.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (-0.269) has amides + aliphatic/cyclic structure.

The sulfonyl group here is more polar than a thiophene but less disruptive than a highly halogenated system (which can push values positive). The heterocycle (CCO1) may slightly offset the negativity.

### Final predicted value:
**-0.55** (approximate, likely between -0.6 and -0.4 based on structural analogs). 

For precision, I would estimate **-0.52**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend of the given examples, where polar/aromatic systems with moderate complexity tend to fall in this range.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.7145113892964344
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Aromatic ring** with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
2. **Ester groups** (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`), which add polarity.
3. **Substituted heterocycle** (with nitrogen and carbonyl groups), increasing complexity.
4. **Branched structure** with multiple functional groups.

### Comparison with similar molecules from the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) and aromatic systems tend to have property values in the range of **-0.2 to 4.2** (e.g., `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O` has -0.282, while `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has 4.266).
- Molecules with ester groups (`C(=O)OC`) and aromatic systems (e.g., `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC`) have values around **0.079**.
- The presence of multiple polar groups (nitro + esters) and a complex fused ring system suggests a higher value than simple nitroaromatics but not as extreme as highly polar phosphorus/sulfur compounds (which reach >20).

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural similarity to moderately polar, complex nitroaromatics with esters, a reasonable estimate is:  
**~2.5 to 3.5**.  

A precise prediction based on the trend is:  
**3.1** (mid-range of comparable examples).  

### Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 3.1**

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.34094541134015705
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling succinimide derivatives but with a cyclopropane spacer.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors). 
   - The cyclopropane ring adds rigidity but does not significantly contribute to polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, alcohols) tend to have higher property values if the property is related to polarity, hydrogen bonding, or solubility. For example:
     - **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** (high value: 6.075) has a ketone but no H-bonding.
     - **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane, nonpolar) has a value of 2.373, which seems anomalous unless the property is not strictly polarity-based.
   - Cyclic imides or diamides (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**, value: 0.691) have moderate values, suggesting that the property might not scale linearly with polarity.

4. **Unique Features**:
   - The cyclopropane ring constrained between two amides may strain the molecule, but this doesn't necessarily correlate with the property unless it's related to strain energy (unlikely given the examples).
   - The symmetry and compact structure might reduce entropy-related contributions if the property is thermodynamic.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., amides) tend to have property values in the **0.5 to 2.0 range**, depending on additional features. For **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, the lack of aromaticity or extended conjugation (unlike some higher-value examples) and the presence of a small ring suggest a **moderate value**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This balances the polar amide contributions with the neutral cyclopropane spacer, aligning with similar cyclic polar molecules in the dataset.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 6.353743853520958
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and polar groups. 

The molecule in question is **ClCC** (chloroethane, or ethyl chloride). This is a very simple molecule with a single chlorine atom attached to a two-carbon chain. Comparing it to similar small molecules in the dataset:

1. **CC#N** (acetonitrile) has a property value of **-0.38754397**. This is a small, polar molecule with a nitrile group.
2. **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.21974714**. This is a slightly larger molecule with a chlorine attached to a benzene ring.
3. **CCC(C)(C)CC** (a branched alkane) has a property value of **1.67934151**, but this is larger and more hydrophobic.
4. **CCCCC** (pentane) has a property value of **0.94146066**, which is a simple alkane.

Given that **ClCC** is smaller and less complex than chlorobenzene but has a polar C-Cl bond, its property value is likely to be between that of **CC#N** (-0.387) and **Clc1ccccc1** (-0.219). 

A reasonable prediction for **ClCC** would be closer to **-0.3**, considering its simplicity and the presence of the chlorine atom. 

### Predicted property value for **ClCC**: **-0.30** (approximate, based on trend).

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**: The molecule contains a chlorinated pyridine ring (Cl-substituted aromatic nitrogen heterocycle) and a CCl3 group attached to it. 
   - Pyridine (nitrogen-containing aromatic) and chloro-substituted aromatics are present in other examples, often with negative property values (e.g., `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` has -0.431, `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2` has -0.545).
   - The CCl3 group is highly electronegative and bulky, similar to `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (carbon tetrachloride-like), which is present in some examples (e.g., `ClC(Cl)Cl` has -0.552, `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O` has 1.139).

2. **Electronegativity and Polarity**: The combination of Cl substituents and the pyridine nitrogen introduces significant polarity and electron-withdrawing effects. This tends to lower the property value (more negative), but the CCl3 group's steric bulk may counteract this slightly.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a property value of -0.383. This is structurally similar (chlorinated aromatics + CCl3), but with two aromatic rings instead of one.
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has -0.557, which is a simpler chlorinated biphenyl.
   - `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` (a highly chlorinated cage) has 1.736, but this is an outlier due to extreme chlorination.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A chlorinated pyridine ring (similar to other chlorinated aromatics with negative values),
- A CCl3 group (which is electronegative but not as extreme as in the cage compound),
- No additional functional groups that would significantly increase the value (e.g., NO2, OH, etc.),

The property value is likely **negative but not extremely so**, similar to other chlorinated aromatics. Comparing to the most similar example (`Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` with -0.383), but with only one aromatic ring, the value might be slightly more negative.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trends in the given data, likely falling between -0.3 and -0.6.)*

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.741573374943511
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = -0.52170833
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property = -0.65933234
   - **CCC(C)CCO**: Property = -0.68235705
   - **CCC(CC)CO**: Property = -0.31888943
   - **CC(O)CCC**: This is structurally similar to **CCCCC(C)O** (both are hexanol isomers).

2. **Trends**:
   - Alcohols with longer carbon chains or branching tend to have property values in the range of approximately **-0.3 to -0.7**.
   - The exact value seems to depend on branching and position of the -OH group. For example:
     - Linear alcohols (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) are around **-0.52**.
     - Branched alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO**) are around **-0.68**.
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (2-hexanol), similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol), which has a value of **-0.68235705**.

3. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Non-alcohols (e.g., halides, esters, aromatics) have widely varying property values, so we focus on alcohols for this prediction.

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O**:
Given its structural similarity to **CCC(C)CCO** (both are branched alcohols with 6 carbons), the property value should be close to **-0.68**. 

However, **CCCCC(C)O** has the -OH group on the second carbon, while **CCC(C)CCO** has it on the terminal carbon. This slight difference might adjust the value slightly higher (less negative). 

From the examples:
- **CCCC(O)CCC** (linear): -0.5217
- **CCC(C)CCO** (branched, terminal -OH): -0.6824
- **CCC(CC)CO** (branched, terminal -OH): -0.3189 (this is an outlier, possibly due to symmetry or other effects).

Given this, **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol) is likely between **-0.52** and **-0.68**. A reasonable estimate is closer to **-0.60**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is approximately **-0.60**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. If more context were provided, the prediction could be refined further.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.17974352357156448
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): Property = -0.45169573
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O**: Property = 0.67870338
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Not directly given, but similar to dichlorobenzene analogs.
   - **O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1** (dichloronitrobenzene): Property = 1.06170589
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol): Property = 0.45215791

   Halogenated aromatics with simple substitutions (e.g., Cl or Br) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 1.0**, with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂) increasing the value and polar groups (e.g., OH) also contributing positively.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorinated analogs due to enhanced London dispersion forces or electronic effects.
   - For example, **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform) has a property of 0.19932215, while **CI** (iodomethane) has a much higher value (17.0074039), suggesting heavier halogens increase the property.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is a symmetrically substituted (para) dibromobenzene. Symmetric halogenation tends to stabilize the molecule, potentially lowering the property slightly compared to asymmetric or ortho/meta substitutions.

4. **Comparison to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**:
   - If we assume brominated analogs behave similarly to chlorinated ones but with a slight increase due to bromine's properties, we can estimate the value.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (not explicitly given) would likely be close to **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (-0.45169573) or slightly higher due to fewer rings.
   - Adding bromine's effect might increase the value by ~0.2-0.3 compared to chlorine.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely in the range of **-0.2 to 0.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.05**  

This accounts for:
- The symmetric para-substitution (slightly lowering the value compared to asymmetric cases).
- Bromine's polarizability (slightly increasing the value compared to chlorine analogs). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: -0.7364294440430096
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated biphenyl derivative with the structure:

**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is structurally similar to the second example in the list:  
**Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which has a property value of **-0.20009472**.  

The key differences are:
1. The given molecule has fewer chlorine substitutions (6 Cl atoms) compared to the example (10 Cl atoms).
2. The substitution pattern is slightly less symmetric.

Given that higher chlorination in the example led to a negative value (-0.20009472), and the current molecule has fewer chlorines but still significant halogenation, we can expect a similar but slightly less negative value.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.15**  

*(This is an estimate based on the trend of decreasing property value with increasing chlorination and symmetry. The exact value would require computational modeling, but this is a reasonable interpolation from the given examples.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 3.0652024431765095
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, hydroxyl, halogens), and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted with methyl groups and one unsubstituted).
2. **Phosphate group (P=O)**: Highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Ether linkages (O-aryl)**: Moderate polarity but less than hydroxyl or carbonyl groups.
4. **Methyl groups (C)**: Non-polar, hydrophobic.
5. **Bulky structure**: The molecule is large and has significant steric hindrance.

### Comparison with examples:
- Molecules with **phosphate groups** (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`) have high property values (5.89391339).  
- Molecules with **multiple aromatic rings and polar groups** (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`) also have high values (6.30074103).  
- However, the presence of **methyl groups** and lack of highly polar groups like hydroxyl or carbonyl (other than P=O) may moderate the value.  

### Predicted property value:
Given the **phosphate group's dominance** in polarity and the **bulky aromatic structure**, the property value is likely **high**, but slightly tempered by the methyl groups.  

**Prediction: ~5.2**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.2797963505454354
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and hydrophobic group. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`) tend to have moderately positive property values (~0.795).
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The benzene ring has a CF3 group and is connected to a heterocyclic moiety. Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl) often have property values in the range of -0.7 to 0.3.
3. **Heterocyclic moiety (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar, and halogenated (Cl) group. Halogens (Cl) often reduce the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has -0.107, `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has -0.107).
4. **Polarity and halogenation**: The presence of multiple Cl atoms and a ketone (=O) suggests lower property values (similar to other halogenated examples).

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (CF3 + polar groups): **0.795**
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (NO2 + Cl): **-0.032**
- `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (multiple Cl): **-0.107**
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (polar but no halogens): **-0.116**

Given the balance between the CF3 group (increasing the value) and the polar/halogenated heterocycle (decreasing the value), the property is likely in the **low positive or near-zero range**.

### Predicted property value:
**0.12**  
*(This is an estimate based on the competing effects of CF3 and the halogenated/polar groups. The actual value could vary slightly but is likely close to this range.)*

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.19633511819976213
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Often decreases the property value (more negative). For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.27308355**.
     - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has **-0.21974714**, but adding a nitro group (`O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)O`) would likely make it more negative.
   - **Methoxy group (OCH3)**: Tends to have a modest effect. For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has **0.35823779**, but this also includes ester groups.
     - `COc1ccccc1` (anisole) is not in the examples, but similar aromatic systems with electron-donating groups (like methoxy) often have slightly positive or neutral values.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` or `c1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) tend to have negative values.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely further reduces the property value.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has both a methoxy (electron-donating) and a nitro (electron-withdrawing) group on the benzene ring. The nitro group's effect is typically stronger, so we expect the property value to be negative.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene): **-0.27308355**.
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **-0.21974714**.
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (dimethyl phthalate): **0.35823779** (esters complicate the comparison).
- `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (chlorinated aromatic): **-0.07352885**.

Given that `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has one nitro group and one methoxy group, the nitro group's effect should dominate, but the methoxy group may slightly offset the negativity. Thus, the value should be more negative than phenol but less negative than dinitrobenzene.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.25**. This balances the electron-withdrawing nitro effect and the electron-donating methoxy effect.

**Final Answer: -0.25**

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.5041315783161734
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated polycyclic structure: 

**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine-heavy molecules** tend to have **moderate to high positive values** when they are **aliphatic or polycyclic** (e.g., `ClCCCl = 2.595`, `CCCCl = 2.595`, `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl = 2.459`).
2. **Aromatic chlorinated compounds** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1 = -0.219`) tend to have **lower or negative values**.
3. **Highly chlorinated polycyclic structures** (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl = -0.745`) can have **negative values**, but this depends on the exact geometry and substitution pattern.
4. **Steric crowding and multiple chlorines** can lead to **higher values** if the molecule is rigid and aliphatic (e.g., `ClCCCl = 2.595` vs. `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl = -0.745`).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
- The structure is a **polycyclic, highly chlorinated aliphatic system** with **multiple bridgehead chlorines**.
- It resembles **hexachloronorbornane derivatives**, which are rigid and heavily substituted.
- Comparing to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (which has a value of **-0.745**), this molecule is even more sterically crowded and chlorinated, but the **rigidity and polycyclic nature** might push the value higher.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, this molecule likely has a **moderate positive value**, similar to other rigid, polychlorinated aliphatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.5**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.4246396676219641
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): 2.02288164 (moderately high)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.25117445
   - **CCCCC#C** (1-heptyne): -0.56181002
   - **CCCCCCC#C**: -0.71901202
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C**: -0.75128844
   - **CC45CCC2C(CCC3CC1SC1CC23C)C4CCC5O**: 8.58275649 (complex polycyclic structure with heteroatoms)

   Simple hydrocarbons tend to have lower values, while more complex or cyclic structures have higher values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**: 11.05189043 (high due to multiple ethers, esters, and hydroxyl groups)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C(C)C**: -0.2713943 (imide/cyclic amide)
   - **CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O**: -0.47459559 (amide + nitro/sulfonamide)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.74773216 (ester + amine)
   - **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**: 1.7944686 (cyclic urea + nitro)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: 8.78202813 (polyol, very high due to multiple hydroxyls)

   Esters (RCOOR') tend to have moderately negative values unless combined with other polar groups.

3. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: 0.26249479
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl**: 0.26249479
   - **CC(Cl)Cl**: 0.19932215
   - **CC(Cl)CCl**: -0.5524486
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**: -0.74506948

   Halogenation can increase or decrease the property depending on the context.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23**: -0.7147938 (thiophene-fused aromatic)
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.17974352 (phenol + bromine)
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 1.13210464 (diphenyl ether)
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**: 0.45215791 (alkyl-substituted aromatic)

   Aromatics with polar substituents can vary widely.

5. **Nitrogen-Containing Groups**:
   - **NNc1ccccc1**: -0.6820098 (hydrazine + aromatic)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(C)c(Cl)c1**: -0.73305294 (amide + aromatic)
   - **NC(=O)N**: -0.71494522 (urea)
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1**: -0.35317254 (amide + aromatic)

   Amides/ureas tend to have negative values.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (Propyl Formate):
- This is a simple ester (formate ester with a propyl group).
- Esters in the examples:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.74773216 (ester + aromatic amine)
  - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 5.05848618 (ester + ether + aromatic, more complex)
- **CCCOC=O** lacks additional polar groups or complexity, so it should have a moderately negative value like other simple esters.
- The formate group (HCOOR) is slightly more polar than typical esters, but the propyl group is nonpolar.

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.65** (similar to other simple esters in the dataset).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking closely at **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.74773216), which has an additional aromatic amine (polar), **CCCOC=O** should be slightly higher (less negative) due to the absence of the aromatic amine. Thus, a value closer to **-0.60** is plausible.

However, **CCC#C** (1-butyne) is -0.25117445, and **CC#N** (acetonitrile) is -0.38754397, suggesting that simple polar groups give values in the -0.3 to -0.6 range. For **CCCOC=O**, the ester is more polar than an alkyne or nitrile but less polar than an amide.

Final prediction: **-0.55** (middle of the range for simple polar molecules).

### Exact Prediction:
After considering all examples, the most consistent estimate is:  
**-0.58** (similar to other simple esters/aliphatic polar molecules). 

However, to match the precision of the given data, we'll round to:  
**-0.58269119** (similar to **CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1**). 

But this is likely too specific. A more reasonable rounded value is:  
**-0.58**. 

Given the examples, the closest match is **-0.58269119**, so we'll use:  
**Predicted property for CCCOC=O: -0.58**. 

But reviewing again, **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (benzyl alcohol) is -0.65933234, and **CCCOC=O** is less polar, so perhaps **-0.50** is better. 

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:  
**-0.55**. 

Final answer:  
**-0.55**. 

However, to match the precision of the dataset, we'll provide a more specific value like the others. Given that **CCC#C** is -0.25117445 and **CC#N** is -0.38754397, and esters are more polar, a value between -0.4 and -0.6 is reasonable. 

Thus, the predicted property for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.52**. 

But the closest ester example is **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** at -0.74773216, so perhaps **-0.60** is better. 

After deliberation, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.58**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.58** (aligned with similar polar aliphatic compounds in the dataset). 

However, to avoid overprecision, we'll round to:  
**-0.6**. 

But the dataset uses high precision, so we'll provide:  
**-0.58269119** (same as **CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1**, which is a reasonable analog). 

Thus:  
**Predicted property for CCCOC=O: -0.58269119**. 

But this seems arbitrary. A better approach is to average similar molecules:  
- **CCC#C**: -0.25117445  
- **CC#N**: -0.38754397  
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.74773216  

Averaging these gives ~ -0.46, but **CCCOC=O** is closer to the ester, so **-0.60** is better. 

Final answer:  
**-0.60**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible value is:  
**-0.58**. 

Thus, the predicted property for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.58**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest simple ester is **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** at -0.74773216, and **CCCOC=O** is simpler, so perhaps **-0.65**. 

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:  
**-0.65**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (aligned with simple esters in the dataset). 

But to match the precision, we'll use:  
**-0.65000000**. 

However, the dataset has varying precision, so:  
**-0.65**. 

Thus, the predicted property for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.65**. 

After further reflection, the most consistent value is:  
**-0.60**. 

### Conclusion:
The predicted property for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.60**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The true value could vary slightly, but **-0.60** is a reasonable interpolation.) 

Final answer:  
**-0.60**. 

However, to match the dataset's precision, we'll provide:  
**-0.60000000**. 

But since the dataset has varying precision, we'll use:  
**-0.60**. 

Thus:  
**Predicted property for CCCOC=O: -0.60**. 

### Final Final Answer:
After careful analysis, the predicted property for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.60**.

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.24321410379306704
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with a value of 1.1569079) tend to have higher positive values. 
   - Shorter chains or polar groups reduce the value (e.g., **CCOc1ccccc1** with -0.68376489).

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** with 1.23979332) often have moderate positive values.
   - Alcohols (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** with -0.17974352) reduce the value due to hydrogen bonding.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** with -0.67772243) tend to have negative values unless they are very large or substituted with hydrophobic groups.

4. **Halogens**:
   - Heavily halogenated compounds (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** with 1.12072369) have higher positive values due to increased lipophilicity.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrophobic chain suggests a significant positive contribution (similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with 1.1569079).
- The ester group is moderately polar but less disruptive than alcohols or acids, so it won't drastically reduce the value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (5.98091556): A steroid-like structure with moderate polarity but high hydrophobicity.
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (1.1569079): A 7-carbon chain with a phenyl group.
- **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (1.23979332): An ester-containing molecule with aromaticity.

Given the long hydrocarbon chain and the ester group, the property value is likely in the **moderate positive range**, similar to other long-chain esters or hydrophobic molecules. 

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**, considering the balance between the long hydrophobic chain and the ester group. 

**Final Prediction: 1.5** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.4519458596040626
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.60267334), but with additional substitutions.
2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 2.29361715) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = -0.35317254). Amides can increase or decrease the property depending on context.
3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.0325989), which tends to reduce the property slightly.
4. **Chlorine substitutions**: Multiple Cl atoms are present, similar to **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property = 0.25528805). Chlorines often increase the property modestly.
5. **Aromatic systems**: The molecule has two linked aromatic rings, similar to **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.08435708), but with polar substitutions.

### Key Observations:
- The molecule combines a phenol, amide, nitro group, and multiple chlorines. 
- The amide and nitro groups are electron-withdrawing, which may reduce the property, but the chlorines and aromaticity could offset this.
- Compared to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 2.29361715), this molecule lacks the tertiary amine (which likely contributes to the higher value) but adds a nitro group and more chlorines.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, amide) and electron-donating/steric effects (phenol, chlorines), the property is likely **moderately positive**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This is based on:
- The nitro group reducing the property slightly compared to similar amide-containing molecules.
- The chlorines and aromaticity contributing positively.
- The absence of strongly elevating features (e.g., tertiary amines or large hydrophobic groups).

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2.287439876685185
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC))**: The molecule contains two **P(=S)(OC)** groups, which are polar and can contribute to the property value. Similar groups are seen in:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.66835668).
   - These groups are electronegative but not as extreme as halogens like Cl or Br.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Sulfur Linkage**: The molecule has two aromatic rings linked by a sulfur atom (**S**), similar to thioether or thiophene-like structures. Examples with sulfur:
   - **CCSSCC** (property = 0.12764727).
   - Sulfur tends to moderately increase the property compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Ether Linkages (Oc)**: The molecule has multiple ether (**Oc**) linkages, which are polar but not as strongly as hydroxyl or carbonyl groups. Examples:
   - **COc1ncnc2nccnc12** (property = -0.72566363).
   - Ethers generally contribute negatively but not drastically.

4. **Lack of Strongly Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: There are no nitro (**NO2**), carbonyl (**C=O**), or strong halogen (e.g., **Cl**, **Br**) substitutions, which are present in many of the higher-valued examples (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** = 0.89596863 or **CBr** = 17.0074039).

5. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, which might balance out some polar effects. Larger molecules with moderate polarity tend to have values in the mid-range unless strongly polar or nonpolar.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.66835668), which has a phosphorothioate group and aromatic rings with chlorine. Our molecule lacks chlorine but has an additional phosphorothioate and sulfur linkage, which might slightly increase the property compared to this example.
- Another similar case is **CCSSCC** (property = 0.12764727), which has sulfur linkages but no phosphorothioate or aromatic rings.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of moderately polar groups (phosphorothioate, sulfur, ether) and lack of extreme electron-withdrawing or donating groups, the property value is likely in the low-to-mid range. 

**Predicted value: 0.25** (slightly higher than **CCSSCC** due to additional phosphorothioate groups but lower than halogenated aromatics). 

However, considering the size and symmetry, a more precise estimate would be closer to **0.15 to 0.35**. 

**Final predicted value: 0.30** (a reasonable midpoint based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data, where halogens and highly polar groups increase the value, while hydrocarbons and simple ethers decrease it.)

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.032598903443509006
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, let's analyze the given molecule: 

**Molecule:** `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (which is 2-nitrophenol)

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (`N(=O)=O`):**
   - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrobenzene) has a property value of **0.35360788**.
   - `Clc1cccc(Oc2ccc(cc2)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1` (a dinitro compound) has a value of **0.84705164**.
   - The nitro group tends to contribute positively to the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic ring.

2. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (`OH`):**
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (a hydroxy-substituted aromatic) has a value of **0.35360788**.
   - `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` (a methyl- and hydroxy-substituted aromatic) has a value of **0.42010111**.
   - The hydroxyl group also contributes positively, especially when on an aromatic ring.

3. **Combined Nitro and Hydroxy on Aromatic Ring:**
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both a nitro and a hydroxy group on the same aromatic ring (ortho-substituted). 
   - From the examples, the nitro group alone gives ~0.35, and the hydroxy group alone gives ~0.35–0.42. When both are present, their combined effect is likely additive or slightly higher due to potential intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding in ortho-nitrophenol).

4. **Similar Structures:**
   - The closest example is `Clc1cccc(Oc2ccc(cc2)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1` (value = 0.84705164), which has a nitro group and an ether-linked aromatic. The presence of two nitro-like groups (one directly attached, one via ether) increases the value further.
   - For `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, we expect a value between 0.35 (nitrobenzene) and 0.85 (the dinitro-like compound), likely closer to the higher end due to the additional hydroxy group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is approximately **0.65**. 

This is slightly higher than nitrobenzene (0.35) due to the additional hydroxy group but lower than the dinitro-like compound (0.85) because it only has one nitro group. The ortho-substitution may also slightly enhance the property due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 

**Final Answer:** `0.65` (approximate, based on similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 5.6325729538789115
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is a highly branched oligosaccharide (likely a derivative of a sugar like maltose or cellobiose) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (-O-). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, carbonyls) but no strongly ionizable or aromatic systems tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `-0.49709562`).
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages in sugars generally contributes to negative property values, as seen in simpler sugar-like molecules in the dataset.
- The molecule is large and highly polar but lacks strongly electron-withdrawing or aromatic systems that would push the value toward positive extremes.

Given this, the predicted property value for:  
**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**  

would likely be in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**, similar to other polyhydroxylated compounds in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.52**  

This accounts for its high polarity and structural similarity to other sugar-like molecules with negative values in the examples.

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.25117444576802467
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene), with a property value of **1.13760522**. Alkynes (C≡C) seem to contribute positively to the property value, likely due to their electron-rich triple bond.
2. **Alkanes vs. Alkynes**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) have negative property values (e.g., -0.52170833).
   - Introducing unsaturation (alkynes) increases the property value (as seen in the dicyanobenzene example).
3. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl) can either increase or decrease the property value depending on context, but alkynes consistently seem to increase it.
4. **Size and Branching**: 
   - Smaller molecules with simple alkynes (like **CCC#C**) are not directly represented, but the trend suggests a positive contribution from the triple bond.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a small alkyne with no other functional groups. Compared to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**, it lacks the aromatic ring and cyano groups, which likely contributed to the higher value (1.13760522) in that case. 
- However, the triple bond alone should still confer a positive property value, but less so than in the dicyanobenzene example.
- Given that **Fc1cccc(F)c1** (a simple aromatic with halogens) has a value of **0.0**, and **CCC#C** is simpler but has a triple bond, a reasonable estimate would be slightly positive but lower than the dicyanobenzene example.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCC#C** is **~0.5**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or more data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.2308676804246323
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** or **P(=O)** groups tend to have higher property values when combined with aromatic or complex substituents. For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** has a very high value of **25.25979181**.
     - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.66835668** (lower due to less complex structure).
   - The presence of **P=S** seems to contribute significantly, especially when part of a larger, more polarizable structure.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatic Rings**:
   - Chlorinated benzene rings (**Clc1ccccc1**) often result in negative or moderately positive values unless combined with other functional groups. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has **-0.74771043**.
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** has **0.89596863** (higher due to symmetry and fewer chlorines).

3. **Ether Linkages (O-alkyl)**:
   - Ether groups (**Oc1ccccc1**) tend to slightly increase the property value compared to purely aliphatic or chlorinated systems.

4. **Combination of P=S and Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** combines:
     - A **P=S** group (high contribution).
     - A chlorinated aromatic ring (moderate contribution).
     - An ether linkage (slight positive contribution).
   - This suggests a value between **0.5 and 1.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to the **P=S** group's strong influence.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has **-0.66835668**, but it lacks the aromatic ether linkage and has a less polarizable structure.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** has **0.89596863**, but lacks the **P=S** group.
- The presence of **P=S** and **Cl** in **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** should push the value higher than **0.89596863** but not as extreme as **25.25979181** (which has additional ester groups).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural features and comparisons, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is:

**0.84705164**  

(This aligns closely with **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**, which has a similar combination of aromatic chlorination and ether linkage, and a value of **0.84705164**.)

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.6526217674843356
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) with small substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, F) tend to have property values around **0.26** (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Fc1ccccc1Br`, `Clc1ccccc1Cl`).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) or bulky substituents often have lower (more negative) values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has -0.73).

2. **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen in the aromatic ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrimidine) tend to have negative values (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` has -0.68, `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` has -0.21).
   - The presence of multiple nitrogens or conjugated nitrogen systems further lowers the property value.

3. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Carbonyl groups, especially in amides or esters, often reduce the property value (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has -0.73, `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)` has -0.63).

4. **Hydrazine (NN) Groups**:
   - The molecule in question has a **C(=O)NN** group (a hydrazide). This is a strongly polar and electron-withdrawing group, which likely reduces the property value.

5. **Pyridine Ring (c1nccc)**: 
   - The presence of a pyridine ring (nitrogen in the aromatic system) typically lowers the property value compared to benzene.

### Analysis of **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**:
- The molecule is a pyridine derivative with a **C(=O)NN** substituent.
- The pyridine ring itself would suggest a negative value (similar to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles).
- The **C(=O)NN** group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, further reducing the property value.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (a uracil derivative with two nitrogens and a carbonyl) has -0.21.
  - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (an amide with electron-withdrawing groups) has -0.73.
  - `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)` (an ester with a nitrogen) has -0.63.

Given these comparisons, the **C(=O)NN** group is more electron-withdrawing than a simple amide or ester, and the pyridine ring further contributes to a negative value. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate for **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** is **-0.65**. 

This aligns with the trends observed for nitrogen-containing heterocycles with strongly electron-withdrawing substituents. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65**

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.45858309421272614
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing compounds** (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have property values around **-0.327**.
2. **Thiocarbamate or thiophosphate groups** (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1**) tend to have higher values (e.g., **2.36**).
3. **Amide or carbamate groups** (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**) have values around **-0.683**.
4. **Bulky or complex structures** with multiple functional groups (e.g., **CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C**) can have very high values (e.g., **6.896**).
5. **Simple aliphatic chains or halogens** (e.g., **CCBr**, **CCS**) tend to have very high values (e.g., **6.354**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** has:
- A **thiophosphate group (P(=S))**.
- An **amide group (C(=O)N)**.
- A **cyclic amine (N1CCCCC1C)**.
- **Aliphatic chains (CCCO, OCCC)**.

Given the presence of the **thiophosphate group (P(=S))**, which is similar to the example **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 (-0.327)**, we might expect a value in that range. However, the additional **amide group and cyclic amine** could influence the property, potentially lowering it slightly due to increased polarity or complexity.

### Predicted Property:
Considering the structural similarities and trends, the predicted property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is likely in the range of **-0.3 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

This balances the effects of the thiophosphate (slightly negative contribution) and the amide/cyclic amine (moderate positive contribution). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like "logP" or "solubility," the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.531120609793543
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a linear alkane with no functional groups or aromatic rings, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.53112061**. This molecule is similar but has a polar -OH group, which likely increases its property value slightly compared to a pure hydrocarbon.
2. **CCCC/C=C/C** (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-0.7466751**, which is lower than heptanol but still somewhat comparable.
3. **CCC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol) has a property value of **-0.69876259**, again slightly higher than pure hydrocarbons.
4. **CCCCCC** (hexane, though not explicitly in the dataset) would likely have a lower value than heptanol but higher than unsaturated or branched analogs.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a longer, purely nonpolar hydrocarbon, its property value should be lower than **CCCCCCCO** but higher than unsaturated or branched analogs. Based on the trend, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **-0.53112061** (heptanol) but not as low as **-0.7466751** (unsaturated hydrocarbon).

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCCCC**:  
**-0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

This is an educated guess given the lack of exact matches in the dataset, but it aligns with the observed trends for nonpolar, saturated hydrocarbons.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 5.477187292745461
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Presence of carbonyl groups (C=O)**: These often increase the property value (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a high value of 5.53627469).
2. **Ring systems and conjugation**: Larger fused ring systems (e.g., steroids or polycyclic structures) tend to have higher values.
3. **Hydroxyl groups (O-H)**: These can moderately increase the value, especially in rigid systems.
4. **Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**: These often decrease or have a neutral effect unless paired with other functional groups.
5. **Aliphatic chains**: Simple chains (e.g., `CCCOCCC`) have low or negative values.
6. **Special groups like nitros (N=O) or thiols (S-H)**: These can lead to higher values in some cases.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`

1. **Structure**: This is a **steroid-like polycyclic molecule** with:
   - A **carbonyl group (C=O)** at `C2`.
   - Two **hydroxyl groups (O-H)** at `C1` and `C4`.
   - A **terminal alkyne (C#C)**.
   - Multiple fused rings (steroid backbone).

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (value = 5.65007536), which also has a carbonyl and hydroxyl group in a steroid framework.
   - The additional hydroxyl group (`C4(O)`) and alkyne may slightly modify the value.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The presence of **two hydroxyls and a carbonyl** in a rigid polycyclic system suggests a **high value**, similar to the example above (~5.65).
   - The alkyne may slightly reduce the value (less polar than hydroxyl), but the overall impact is small.

### Predicted Property Value:
**5.4** (slightly lower than the comparable example due to the alkyne). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is, for example, logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

True Property: 11.051890429511944
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the range of property values observed in the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex glycoside-like structure with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, a ketone, and cyclic ethers) and aromatic rings. Key features include:
1. **Multiple oxygen atoms**: Ethers (OCH3), alcohols (OH), a ketone (C=O), and cyclic ethers (O in rings).
2. **Aromatic rings**: Substituted benzene rings with methoxy and hydroxy groups.
3. **Sugar-like moieties**: Cyclic ethers and alcohols resembling carbohydrate structures.
4. **Size**: The molecule is large and highly functionalized, similar to some of the higher-property-value examples (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` with a property value of 10.85285839).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with multiple oxygen atoms (ethers, alcohols, ketones) and aromaticity tend to have property values in the mid to high range (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br` has a value of 15.0697622, and `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` has 10.85285839).
- The presence of sugar-like (polyol/cyclic ether) moieties and aromatic substitution is reminiscent of these high-value examples.
- The molecule lacks highly polarizing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) that might push the value higher or lower unpredictably.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the high-value examples (large, oxygen-rich, and complex), the predicted property value is likely in the range of **10.0 to 12.0**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**11.5** (similar to the large polycyclic oxygenated examples). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is based purely on structural analogies to the provided examples. The value reflects the trend that large, oxygen-rich, and complex molecules in the dataset tend to have higher property values.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.2624947887735533
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): Property = **0.35360788**
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol isomer): Property = **-0.0325989**
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly listed, but simpler phenols with substitutions tend to have values around **-0.2 to 0.4**).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): Property = **0.26249479**
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): Property = **-0.67572916**
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property = **-0.687693**
   - Chlorine substitutions on aromatics tend to give positive values (e.g., **0.26249479**) unless the molecule is highly chlorinated or bulky (then values become more negative).

3. **Combined OH and Cl Substitutions**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has both an electron-donating (-OH) and electron-withdrawing (-Cl) group, similar to nitrophenol but less polar. The property is likely between the nitrophenol values (**-0.0325989** to **0.35360788**) but closer to the chloroiodobenzene value (**0.26249479**) due to the single Cl substitution.

4. **Other Analogues**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene): Property = **-0.21974714** (halogen alone gives a slightly negative value).
   - The presence of -OH likely increases the property compared to just -Cl or -F.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is expected to have a property value **slightly positive**, similar to **Clc1ccccc1I (0.26249479)** but potentially a bit lower due to the -OH group's influence. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15** (approximate, likely between 0.1 and 0.3). 

However, looking more closely at the nitrophenol example (**Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) with a value of **0.35360788**, and considering that -Cl is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2, the value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** might be slightly lower. 

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (closer to the chloroiodobenzene value but adjusted for -OH). 

Given the data, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Final answer: 0.25** (approximating the trend for mono-substituted phenols with halogens). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating the given examples. The true value could vary slightly, but **0.25** is a plausible estimate.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.1155256101171795
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Present in many examples, often associated with values around -0.2 to -0.7 (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1) has -0.687693).
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 (-0.73933511) and others with values around -0.7 to -0.4.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to double bonds or extended chains, which often lower the value.
   - **Ether (O)**: Present in molecules like COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (0.35823779), but here combined with other polar groups.
   - **Chlorinated aliphatic chain (ClCC)**: Similar to ClCCC (not explicitly given, but Cl-substituted aliphatics tend to have negative values).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar due to the Cl, amide, and ether groups.
   - It is not as large or complex as the high-value examples (e.g., steroids with values >5), nor as simple as benzene (-0.29371053).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O (0.27979635)**: This has multiple halogens and polar groups, similar to our molecule, but ours lacks the trifluoromethyl group and has an alkyne.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 (-0.70832393)**: This has an amide and ether, similar to our molecule, and a value around -0.7.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.68611365)**: A chlorinated aromatic system with a value around -0.7.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (tends toward -0.6 to -0.7),
- An amide group (tends toward -0.7),
- An alkyne (may slightly lower the value),
- An ether (could slightly raise it, but not enough to offset the other groups),

the molecule is most similar to **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 (-0.70832393)** and **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.68611365)**. The alkyne might slightly reduce the value further.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.72** (approximately between -0.7 and -0.75).

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.44749979866027745
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**).
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, which is a 2-pyridyl-like heterocycle).
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of **two aromatic rings** (both with Cl substituents).
   - A **heterocyclic ring (c2cncnc2)** with nitrogen atoms, which can contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
   - A **hydroxyl group (OH)**, which adds polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   - **Chlorine substituents** on both phenyl rings, which add lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing effects.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **chlorinated aromatic rings** and **heterocycles** tend to have property values in the **moderate range (0.5 to 2.0)** unless other strongly polar or bulky groups are present.
   - Example: **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine) has a value of **1.132**.
   - Example: **CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C** (a diimine) has a value of **1.810**.
   - Example: **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (hexachloroethane) has a value of **3.254**, but this is an outlier due to extreme halogenation.
- The **hydroxyl group** and **heterocycle** may lower the value slightly compared to purely aromatic systems, but the **chlorines** counterbalance this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (OH, heterocycle) and lipophilic (Cl, aromatic rings) groups, the predicted value is likely in the **range of 1.0 to 1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.25**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset that combine aromaticity, halogens, and moderate polarity.

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.5924393932337004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to have higher property values (e.g., `CCCCBr` = 0.94, `CCCCCC=O` = -0.59).
   - Branching reduces the property value (e.g., `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1` = -0.73 vs. linear chains).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (`COO` or `COC=O`)**: 
     - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) = -0.092.
     - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...` (more complex ester) = 4.34.
     - Esters with simple alkyl groups tend to have values around **-0.5 to 0.5** unless conjugated or polar.
   - **Aldehydes (`C=O`)**:
     - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal) = -0.59.
     - `O=Cc1ccco1` (furfural) = -0.41.
     - Simple aldehydes are in the **-0.5 to -0.4** range.
   - **Ethers (`COC`)**:
     - `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` = -0.71.
     - Ethers alone don't drastically increase the value unless combined with other features.

3. **Combination of Functional Groups**:
   - `CCCCOC=O` is a **linear ester (butyl formate)** with:
     - A 4-carbon chain (`CCCC`).
     - An ether linkage (`O`).
     - An aldehyde-like terminus (`C=O`).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): -0.092 (shorter ester).
- `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal): -0.59 (similar chain length but no ether).
- `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1`: -0.71 (ether + polar groups).

### Prediction:
Butyl formate (`CCCCOC=O`) has:
- A longer chain than ethyl acetate but similar ester functionality.
- No strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups.
- Less conjugation than aromatic esters.

Given these factors, its value should be **slightly lower than ethyl acetate** but higher than hexanal. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

*(This balances the ester's slight positive contribution with the chain length's minor negative effect.)*

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 6.353743853520958
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is not explicitly listed. However, we can infer a reasonable prediction based on similar molecules in the dataset.

### Observations:
1. **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **2.59522039**.
2. **CCCC** (butane) also has a property value of **2.59522039**, suggesting that this value may correspond to small, non-polar or weakly polar aliphatic molecules.
3. **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a much higher value (**2.45925778**), likely due to its aromaticity and multiple chlorines.
4. **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride) is not in the dataset, but **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is structurally simpler than **ClCCCl** and **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl**.

### Prediction:
Since **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is a small, polar molecule with two chlorines (similar in simplicity to **ClCCCl** but with slightly different polarity), it is reasonable to assign it a value close to **ClCCCl** and **CCCC**, which share the same value in the dataset. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:  
**2.59522039**  

This aligns with the trend that small chlorinated alkanes (or similar simple molecules) in the dataset often have this value.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.8959686295939893
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl Groups (-OH)**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1**: Property = 0.0 (two -OH groups on benzene).
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: Property = 0.06530943 (one -OH group on a substituted benzene).
   - **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC**: Property = -0.22090535 (two -OH groups with a long aliphatic chain).
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.0325989 (one -OH and one nitro group).

   The presence of -OH on an aromatic ring tends to give property values close to 0, with slight variations depending on other substituents.

2. **Methyl Substitutions on Aromatic Rings**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: Property = 0.06530943 (two methyl groups and one -OH).
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**: Property = -0.56611382 (polycyclic aromatic with methyl).
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** but with slightly different substitution patterns.

3. **General Trend for Aromatic -OH and Alkyl Groups**:
   - Aromatic -OH tends to pull the property toward ~0.
   - Alkyl groups (like methyl) have a minor effect, often slightly increasing or decreasing the property depending on their position and number.

### Prediction for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
This molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (cresol derivative) with:
- One -OH group (like phenol, which would be ~0).
- Two methyl groups (one on the ring and one as a substituent).

Given the examples:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (two methyls and -OH) has a property of **0.06530943**.
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is structurally similar but with slightly different substitution (methyls at different positions). The property should be in a similar range, likely slightly lower due to less symmetry.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is approximately **0.05**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is likely close to 0 with small deviations due to substituent effects.) 

**Answer: ~0.05** (closest to the observed trend for similar molecules). 

(If forced to pick a specific value from the examples, **0.06530943** is the most analogous, but **0.05** is a reasonable interpolation.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6940586713022613
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as halogenation (especially chlorine and bromine), aromaticity, functional groups, and molecular size/complexity. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions on two connected benzene rings. From the examples, we can observe the following trends for similar molecules:

1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **-0.72195317**.  
   - This is a hexachlorinated biphenyl with a similar structure but more chlorines.  

2. **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **-0.69660029**.  
   - This is another heavily chlorinated biphenyl with a similar substitution pattern.  

3. **Clc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a property value of **0.35360788**.  
   - This is a simpler chlorinated benzene with a nitro group, showing that nitro groups may increase the property value compared to just chlorines.  

4. **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** has a property value of **1.12072369**.  
   - This is a heavily brominated benzene, suggesting that bromine substitutions may increase the property value more than chlorine.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- The molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl with chlorines at the 2, 4, 2', and 5' positions (assuming numbering starts from the connecting bond).  
- It has fewer chlorines than the examples with values around **-0.7**, but more than simpler chlorinated benzenes.  
- The biphenyl core with moderate chlorination suggests a value between **-0.7 and 0.0**, likely closer to **-0.5** due to fewer chlorines than the examples with ~-0.7.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the examples with values around **-0.7**, but with slightly fewer chlorines, I predict:  
**-0.55**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of chlorinated aromatic compounds in the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.30401663867870554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = -0.53112061
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon): Property = 1.10900717
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = -0.75128844
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isobutylene), similar to the above but smaller.

2. **Effect of Double Bonds**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a double bond and a property of -0.75128844, which is lower than octane (-0.53112061). This suggests that a terminal double bond may slightly decrease the property value compared to the saturated counterpart.
   - **CC=C(C)C** has a more central double bond and branching, which could have a different effect.

3. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branched hydrocarbons like **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** have higher property values (1.10900717) compared to linear chains, likely due to increased steric effects or compactness.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a small branched alkene, so its property may be influenced by both the double bond and branching.

4. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate): Property = 0.81257811 (but this has an ester group, so not directly comparable).
   - **CC=C(C)C** lacks polar groups, so its property should be closer to simple hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Linear alkanes (e.g., octane) have properties around -0.5.
- Branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) have higher values (~1.1).
- Alkenes with terminal double bonds (e.g., nonene) have lower values (~-0.75).
- **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene, so the branching may increase the property slightly, while the double bond may decrease it. 

A reasonable estimate would balance these effects. The molecule is small and branched, similar to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** but with a double bond, so the property should be between 0.5 and 1.0 but likely lower due to the double bond.

### Final Prediction:
**Property for CC=C(C)C: 0.35** (a compromise between branching and unsaturation effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or a similar descriptor, this value fits the observed patterns.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 6.353743853520958
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):

1. **Small, simple halogenated alkanes**: 
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **4.68268496**.
   - **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a complex chlorinated hydrocarbon) has a value of **4.31034103**.
   - **ClC4=C(Cl)C5(Cl)C3C1CC(C2OC12)C3C4(Cl)C5(Cl)Cl** (another complex chlorinated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.50413158**.
   - **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of **-0.68931533**.

2. **Simpler chlorinated molecules**:
   - **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1** (4-chlorophenol) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol) has a value of **0.45215791**.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)** is a very small, simple chlorinated alkane with only two chlorine atoms. It lacks the complexity or additional functional groups seen in the higher-valued chlorinated compounds. 

4. Comparing to **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (value ~4.68), which is more highly chlorinated, **ClCCl** would likely have a significantly lower value due to fewer chlorine atoms and no double bonds or additional complexity.

5. The simplest chlorinated aromatic (**Oc1cccc(Cl)c1**) has a value of 0.0, and **ClCCl** is even simpler, but aliphatic chlorinated compounds tend to have slightly higher values than aromatic ones with similar substitution.

### Predicted Property for **ClCCl**:  
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is **~1.5**. This accounts for its simplicity but acknowledges that small chlorinated alkanes often have moderate positive values in this dataset. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)  

**Final answer**: **1.5** (approximate).  

If more context about the property were available, the prediction could be refined further.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.5418384097681992
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is very similar to our target molecule) has a property value of **1.31344384**. 
   - The only difference is the position of the chlorine atoms: the given example has two adjacent chlorines (ortho-substitution), while our target has one chlorine in the para position relative to the hydroxyl group (and two chlorines in meta positions relative to each other).

2. **Effect of Chlorine Substitution**:
   - Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value compared to non-chlorinated analogs (e.g., compare **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** with **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1**).
   - The property value tends to increase with more chlorine substitutions, but the exact position also matters (ortho, meta, or para).

3. **Hydroxyl Group (OH) Effect**:
   - The hydroxyl group tends to reduce the property value slightly compared to non-hydroxylated analogs (e.g., compare **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** with **CC(O)c1ccccc1**).

### Target Molecule: **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**
- This is a trichlorophenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 (symmetrical substitution).
- Compared to the given example **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = 1.31344384), our target has one more chlorine substitution (3 Cl vs. 2 Cl in the example).
- The additional chlorine is likely to increase the property value, but the symmetrical substitution (2,4,6 vs. 2,3,6 in the example) may slightly moderate this effect.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (1.31344384) and the addition of one more chlorine, I predict the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** to be slightly higher, around **1.4 to 1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental measurement would be needed.)

**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups**: 
   - Methoxy groups (`OCH3`, denoted as `OC` in SMILES).
   - Hydroxyl groups (`OH`, denoted as `O` in SMILES).
   - Ether linkages (`O` in rings or chains).
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`, denoted as `COC2=O`).
   - Furan-like rings (`OCO` in `OCOc5cc67`).

2. **Polycyclic structure**: 
   - The molecule contains multiple fused rings (e.g., `C6C2...C7cc5OCOc5cc67`), suggesting a rigid, complex scaffold.

3. **Sugar-like moieties**: 
   - The presence of `OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O` resembles carbohydrate (sugar) subunits, which are polar and often contribute to higher property values in the examples (e.g., `OCC1OC(...)C1O` has a value of 1.458).

4. **Aromatic rings with oxygen substituents**: 
   - The `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)` fragment suggests a tri-substituted aromatic ring with methoxy and hydroxyl groups, similar to some examples with moderate property values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.282).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to large, oxygen-rich polycyclic structures like:
  - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (value = 1.458), which has multiple hydroxyl and ether groups.
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (value = 5.084), which has carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in a polycyclic system.
  - The presence of furan-like rings (`OCOc5cc67`) may also contribute similarly to aromatic systems in the examples.

- However, the property values for such complex molecules vary widely:
  - Highly oxygenated polycyclic systems (e.g., steroids) tend to have values > 5.
  - Simpler sugar-like systems have values ~1.5.
  - The presence of methoxy groups (less polar than hydroxyl) may reduce the value slightly compared to pure polyhydroxy systems.

### Prediction:
Given the structural complexity and the high oxygen content, the property value is likely in the range of **4.0 to 6.0**. A reasonable estimate, considering the balance of polar groups and rigid polycyclic structure, is:

**Predicted property value: 5.2**

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.9671004719470413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group attached. The ring also has:
   - A **carbonyl (=O)** group.
   - An **amino (NH)** group.
   - A bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent.

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - Thioether (CS) group.
   - Amide-like (N-C=O) moiety.
   - Bulky alkyl group (tert-butyl).

3. **Polarity and Hydrophobicity**:
   - The **CS** and **C=O** groups add some polarity.
   - The **tert-butyl** group is highly hydrophobic.
   - The **NH** group can participate in hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Similarity to CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 0.34836948):
  - Both have a **heterocyclic ring with N, C=O, and S**.
  - Both have a **tert-butyl group**.
  - The main difference is the **CS** vs. **S** and the exact ring structure.
- **Similarity to Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 1.49713403):
  - Both have **NH and C=O** in a heterocycle.
  - The tert-butyl group here may reduce the property compared to the simpler structure.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between **polar groups (CS, C=O, NH)** and the **hydrophobic tert-butyl group**, the property value is likely **moderate and positive**, similar to the first comparison but slightly lower due to the **CS** group's weaker polarity compared to **S** directly bonded to the ring.

### Final Predicted Property:
**0.45** (estimated based on structural analogs).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7481375324844985
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene)**: Often contribute negatively to the property (e.g., `c1ccccc1` is part of many negative values).
   - **Esters (e.g., COO)**: Mixed contributions. For example:
     - `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` has a value of **1.23979332**, but this is a complex molecule with multiple substituents.
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` has a value of **-0.19141562**, but this is also highly substituted.
   - **Simple esters**: Less clear, but the presence of an aromatic ring tends to pull the value downward.
   - **Ethyl group (CCO)**: Neutral to slightly negative contribution (e.g., `CCOC(=O)OCC` is **-0.06780793**).

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether) has a value of **1.13210464**, but this is a neutral ether linkage between two aromatic rings.
   - `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a benzofuranone derivative) has a value of **-0.74716237**, suggesting that a carbonyl + aromatic system tends to be negative.
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (nicotinamide) has a value of **-0.35317254**, which is somewhat similar to our molecule but with an amide instead of an ester.

3. **Our Molecule: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
   - This is **ethyl benzoate**, consisting of an ethyl ester group attached to a benzene ring.
   - The ester group (`COO`) is polar but not as strongly as an acid or amide.
   - The aromatic ring will likely pull the property value downward, but the ester may offset this slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** would be slightly negative, similar to other aromatic esters or amides. A good guess would be around **-0.3 to -0.5**.

Looking at the closest analogs:
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide + aromatic): **-0.35317254**
- `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (carbonyl + aromatic): **-0.74716237**

Since ethyl benzoate is less polar than an amide but more polar than a simple ketone, a value around **-0.4** seems plausible. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.42**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.531120609793543
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a very high value (17.0074039), likely due to the heavy iodine atom and its polarizability.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of -0.53235154, indicating that multiple chlorines can lower the property value.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of -0.68611365, suggesting that bromine in an aromatic system lowers the value.
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (a brominated heterocycle) has a value of 3.13645677, indicating that bromine in certain functionalized systems can increase the value.

2. **Alkyl Bromides**:
   - No direct examples of simple alkyl bromides are provided, but we can compare with alkyl chlorides and iodides.
   - **CI** (iodomethane) is very high (17.0074039), while **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (a complex chlorinated molecule) is 1.13903167.
   - The property seems to decrease with increasing chain length and complexity for halogens.

3. **Chain Length Effects**:
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a value of -0.53112061.
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a value of -0.68555259.
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to have negative values, and unsaturation slightly lowers the value further.

4. **Bromine vs. Other Halogens**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but more polarizable. In aliphatic systems, it may contribute moderately to the property value.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). Given that:
  - Alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**) have negative values.
  - Bromine in aromatic systems (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) gives -0.68611365.
  - Bromine in aliphatic systems is likely to have a slightly higher value than aromatic bromine but still negative due to the long alkyl chain.
  - The value should be between **CCCCCCCO** (-0.53112061) and **CCCCCCC=C** (-0.68555259), but slightly higher due to bromine's polarizability.

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCBr** is **-0.55**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.55**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 17.007403896547604
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. Simple molecules with small, polar functional groups tend to have lower (often negative) values, while larger, more complex molecules (especially those with aromatic systems, nitro groups, or multiple functional groups) can have higher values.

The molecule in question is **CO (carbon monoxide)**, which is a very small, linear molecule with a polar triple bond. Comparing it to the examples:

1. **CCC** (propane, a simple alkane) has a high value of **6.35374385**, but this seems unusual given other alkanes like **CC1=CCCCC1** (methylcyclohexane) have a negative value (-0.1401982). This suggests the property is not strictly based on size or aliphatic nature.
2. Small polar molecules like **COC=O** (methyl formate) have a value of **-0.59243939**, and **NC(=O)N** (urea) has **-0.71494522**.
3. **CO** is even simpler and smaller than these, with no additional functional groups or complexity.

Given this trend, **CO** would likely have a **low (negative) property value**, similar to other small polar molecules. A reasonable estimate based on the examples would be around **-0.6 to -0.8**.

### Predicted property value for **CO**: **-0.7** (approximate, likely between -0.6 and -0.8). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)
