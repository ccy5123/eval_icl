SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6471701845248036
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features such as chain length, functional groups, and presence of halogens or aromatic rings. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is a long-chain aliphatic ester (specifically, methyl decanoate). 

From the examples:
- **CCCCCC** (hexane) has a property value of -0.77692244.
- **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl octanoate, similar but shorter chain) is not explicitly listed, but longer aliphatic chains tend to have more negative values unless offset by polar or aromatic groups.
- **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is even longer, which would likely push the value further negative, but the ester group (C(=O)OC) introduces some polarity, which may moderate the effect.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (last example in the list), which has a value of -0.29512381. However, the given molecule is longer (C10 vs. C12), but the trend isn't perfectly linear.
- The ester group's effect seems to make the value less negative than pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCC** is -0.77692244).

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** would be slightly more negative than -0.29512381 (due to longer chain) but less negative than -0.77692244 (due to the ester group). 

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, based on interpolation of trends). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more examples of esters, this is an educated guess. The true value could vary depending on the specific property being predicted.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.4835978587570031
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic System with Heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a fused aromatic system with oxygen (O) and nitrogen (NH) in a lactam-like structure (`oc(=O)[nH]`). This is similar to cyclic amides/ureas in the examples (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` with a high value of **0.78632844**).
2. **Chlorine Substituent**: A chlorine atom is attached to the aromatic ring, which can moderately increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has **0.30310089**).
3. **Conjugated Carbonyl (C=O)**: The carbonyl group in the lactam is conjugated with the aromatic system, which often increases the property value (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` has **0.78632844**).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **High-Value Examples**: Molecules with conjugated carbonyls and heteroatoms (e.g., cyclic ureas, lactams) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **0.78632844**, **0.29887534**).
- **Chlorine Effect**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings typically add a moderate positive contribution (e.g., **0.30310089** for a polychlorinated biphenyl).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A conjugated lactam (similar to high-value cyclic ureas),
- An aromatic system with a chlorine substituent,
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or bulky groups to reduce the value,

the property value is likely in the **higher range** but not as extreme as some of the most polar examples. A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.45–0.55**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.50** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

This balances the contributions from the lactam (high value) and the chlorine (moderate positive effect).

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6880837141372319
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups** (e.g., nitro, nitroso, amide, etc.) often contribute to negative property values, especially when combined with electronegative atoms (O, Cl, F).  
   - Example: `Nc1nccs1` → -0.714  
   - Example: `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` → -0.872  
   - Example: `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` → -0.095  

2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** appear in some examples:  
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` → -0.095 (moderately negative, but the molecule is more complex).  
   - Simpler nitroalkanes or nitroso compounds tend to have values between **-0.1 and -0.5**.

3. **Alkyl groups** (e.g., `CC`, `CCC`) often reduce the magnitude of the property unless paired with strongly polar groups.  

### Analysis of **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
- The molecule is a simple nitroalkane (tert-butyl nitro or isopropyl nitro derivative).  
- The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) is polar and electron-withdrawing, likely contributing a negative value.  
- The alkyl group (`CC(C)`) is not highly polar, so it may temper the effect slightly compared to aromatic nitro compounds.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the examples and trends, a reasonable prediction for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** would be:  
**-0.35** (moderately negative, similar to other nitroalkanes in the dataset).  

This aligns with the observed range for nitro-containing compounds while accounting for the alkyl group's mitigating effect.

**Final Answer:**  
**Predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O: -0.35**

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.8964639172335784
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid derivative with multiple rings, hydroxyl (-OH), and carbonyl (C=O) groups. 

Breaking it down:
1. **Steroid backbone**: The polycyclic structure (four fused rings) tends to contribute positively to the property (e.g., see `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` with a value of **0.8626** for a polyaromatic system).
2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups increase polarity, which seems to align with higher property values in some cases (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O` with **0.9195**).
   - However, some carbonyl-containing molecules (e.g., `CC(=O)C(C)(C)C`) have negative values, suggesting context matters (e.g., steric hindrance or aliphatic vs. conjugated systems).
3. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (a steroid with two carbonyls) has a value of **-0.6378**, but this lacks the hydroxyl group.
   - The presence of an additional -OH and -C(=O)CO in the query molecule may offset the negative trend seen in the above example.

Given these observations, the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in a rigid polycyclic system likely push the property toward a **moderately positive value**, but the exact balance is unclear. A reasonable estimate would be between **0.2 and 0.4**, considering the competing effects. 

**Predicted property value: 0.35** (closer to the higher end due to the polar groups outweighing the aliphatic steric effects). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the given examples.*

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.5193066269493034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), connected by a urea-like linker **C(=O)NC(=O)N**. 
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br, F) appear in many examples, with varying effects on the property. For instance:
     - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a high positive value (0.9299).
     - **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a negative value (-0.3234).
     - The presence of halogens can either increase or decrease the property depending on other substituents.

2. **Urea-like Linker (C(=O)NC(=O)N)**: 
   - Similar groups like **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (thiourea) have a negative value (-0.5635).
   - The carbonyl groups (C=O) in the linker may contribute to polarity or hydrogen bonding, often associated with negative values in the examples (e.g., **CCCC=O** is -0.6906).

3. **Fluorine Substituents (F)**:
   - Fluorine substitutions tend to reduce the property (e.g., **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is -0.3234), but this depends on the rest of the structure.

4. **Chlorine Substituent (Cl)**:
   - Chlorine on an aromatic ring (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) is associated with high positive values (0.9299), but when combined with other electronegative groups (like C=O), the effect may be balanced or reversed.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-0.5635) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (0.9299), but with additional polar groups (C=O) and fluorines.
- The urea linker and fluorines likely dominate, pulling the property toward negative values, but the chlorine may offset this slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the competing effects of the polar urea linker (negative contribution) and the chlorine (positive contribution), the property is likely **moderately negative**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: -0.45**  

This balances the negative trend from the urea/fluorine groups and the positive trend from the chlorine.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.3453773468457735
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate property values, often negative but not extremely so. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate, not an ether but similar chain length): **-0.79820577**
     - `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (triethyl phosphate, contains P-O bonds): **-0.6644386**
     - `OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O` (complex sugar ether): **0.82793757** (but this is skewed by many polar groups).
   - Simple ethers like `CCCOC(C)C` are less polar than alcohols or esters, so their values may be closer to zero or slightly negative.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Branched alkanes or ethers often have less negative (or more positive) values than linear ones. For example:
     - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol): **0.90109162**
     - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane): **-0.86759774**
   - The molecule `CCCOC(C)C` has a branched ether (isopropyl group) and a short linear chain (propyl group), which may balance the property value toward a modest negative number.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCCCO` (pentanol): **-0.7341576**
   - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (branched alcohol): **0.90703941**
   - `CCCCCC` (hexane, not in the list but inferred to be very hydrophobic): likely more negative.
   - `CCCOC(C)C` is less polar than an alcohol but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon, so its value should lie between these extremes.

4. **Oxygen-Containing Non-Alcohols**:
   - Ethers without additional polar groups (like `CCCOC(C)C`) tend to have values in the range of **-0.4 to -0.7**, based on the examples.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, **CCCOC(C)C** is a simple branched ether with moderate polarity. Its property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as highly polar or nonpolar molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**

This aligns with the behavior of similar ethers and branched aliphatic compounds in the provided data.

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.691859240860948
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often associated with negative property values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of `-0.02825053`).
   - It has two **carbonyl groups (C=O)** and an **amide-like [nH] group**, which are polar and can contribute to negative values (similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` with `-0.92761643`).
   - The **alkyl chain (CCC(C))** is nonpolar but not very long, so its contribution may be limited.

2. **Aromaticity**: 
   - The core is a **dihydropyrimidine-like ring** (partially aromatic with conjugated C=O and Br), which may resemble some of the aromatic systems in the examples. Aromatic systems with halogens often have intermediate values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has `0.92990956`, but Br is less electronegative than Cl).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Br** and **C=O** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) have slightly negative values (`-0.02825053`).
   - Molecules with **multiple C=O** and **polar groups** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`) have strongly negative values (`-0.92761643`).
   - The presence of **alkyl groups** may offset the polarity slightly (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` has `-0.79058018`).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of **Br**, **two C=O groups**, and **moderate alkyl substitution**, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely so**. A reasonable estimate would be between `-0.4` and `-0.7`. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (Br + C=O): `-0.02825053`
- `Nc1nccs1` (polar N and S): `-0.71499717`
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (multiple C=O): `-0.92761643`

This molecule is more polar than `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` but less polar than `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`. A good intermediate value is:

**Predicted property value: `-0.65`** (approximate, likely between `-0.6` and `-0.7`). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (estimated based on structural similarity to given examples).

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.8972693263175985
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can infer the following trends to predict the property:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have moderate property values, often positive unless functionalized with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl).
   - Example: **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a low value (0.0248), while **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a methyl-substituted naphthalene-like structure) has a high value (0.8790).

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a phenanthrene-like structure with an amine) has a high value (0.7715).
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large fused aromatic) has a very low value (0.0248), suggesting that extended conjugation without polar groups may reduce the property value.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) often increase the property value.
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) decrease the value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1** has -0.8030).

4. **Biphenyl (Target Molecule)**:
   - The target is a simple biphenyl with no substituents. It has two aromatic rings connected by a single bond, allowing some conjugation but less than fused polycyclics.
   - Compared to **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (0.0248), biphenyl is smaller and less conjugated, but more conjugated than benzene (not in examples, but benzene derivatives with simple substituents tend to have moderate values).

### Prediction:
Given the lack of substituents and intermediate conjugation, the property value for biphenyl is likely **moderate and positive**, similar to other unsubstituted aromatic systems but higher than large fused aromatics. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as the exact property is not explicitly defined. The value reflects biphenyl's intermediate conjugation and lack of polar substituents.)
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.9169082811914404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Sulfur (S)**:
   - Molecules with sulfur (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O`, `SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.85 to 0.55**, but this is highly dependent on other functional groups.
   - The molecule `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` (with a thione group) has a high value (**0.906**), but this is likely due to the conjugated heterocyclic structure rather than sulfur alone.
   - Simpler sulfur-containing alkanes like `CCCCS` are not directly represented in the examples, so we must infer from similar structures.

2. **Alkyl Chain Length**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)C`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O`) tend to have property values around **0.5 to -0.9**, but again, this depends on other substituents.
   - The molecule `CCCC(=C)C` (with a double bond) has a value of **-0.795**, while `CCCCCC(C)C` (fully saturated) has **0.499**. This suggests that saturation increases the property value.

3. **Simple Thiols**:
   - No exact thiol (R-SH) examples are given, but `CCCCS` is a simple aliphatic thiol. Given the lack of conjugation or polar groups, it is likely to have a **moderate negative value** similar to other saturated hydrocarbons with heteroatoms.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCCCC(C)C` (heptane with branching): **0.499**
   - `CCCC(=C)C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon): **-0.795**
   - `CC(C)I` (iodoalkane): **-0.881**
   - `CCCCS` is simpler than most examples, but the sulfur atom introduces slight polarity. Given the lack of strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups, its value should be closer to neutral but slightly negative.

### Predicted Property for `CCCCS`:
Given the above trends, **CCCCS** is expected to have a property value in the range of **-0.5 to 0.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.35**  

This is based on:
- The sulfur atom introducing slight polarity (pushing the value slightly negative).
- The lack of conjugation or strong functional groups (no extreme positive or negative values).
- Similarity to other saturated hydrocarbons with heteroatoms (e.g., `CC(C)I` at **-0.881**, but sulfur is less polarizable than iodine, so less negative). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. If more context were provided (e.g., the property is logP), the prediction could be refined further. 

**Final Answer: -0.35**
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.9030330349758371
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O) in Aliphatic Chains or Alcohols (-OH):**
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** has a property value of **0.90703941** (note the tertiary alcohol).
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O** has a property value of **-0.42540014** (secondary alcohol).
   - **CCCCOC** has a property value of **-0.7709831** (ether).
   - **CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C** has a value of **0.10687438** (ester/ether).
   - The presence of oxygen in alcohols tends to increase the property value if it's a tertiary alcohol, while secondary alcohols or ethers may decrease it.

2. **Branching and Chain Length:**
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** has a value of **-0.79058018** (highly branched alkane).
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** has a value of **-0.86759774** (even more branched alkane).
   - Branching tends to decrease the property value, especially in non-polar alkanes.

3. **Combination of Branching and Oxygen:**
   - **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched alkane with a primary alcohol (-OH) at the end.
   - Similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (tertiary alcohol, value = 0.907), but with a primary alcohol instead.
   - Primary alcohols are less stabilizing than tertiary alcohols, so the value may be lower than 0.907 but still positive due to the oxygen.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Branching alone (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**) gives a negative value (~ -0.79).
- Adding a primary alcohol (**-OH**) likely increases the value but not as much as a tertiary alcohol.
- The molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is branched but has a polar -OH group, which may partially offset the negative effect of branching.

From similar examples:
- **CC(C)CC(C)O** (secondary alcohol, less branched) = -0.425.
- **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (tertiary alcohol) = 0.907.
- **CCCC(C)(C)CO** (primary alcohol, more branched) is likely between these two.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **~0.3 to 0.5**, considering the balance between branching (negative contribution) and the primary alcohol (positive but weaker than tertiary). 

However, looking at **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (0.907) and noting that replacing the tertiary -OH with a primary -OH would reduce the value, but not below zero (since oxygen is still present), I predict:

**Predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO: ~0.45**

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.) 

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (approximate, based on structural trends in the examples).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.058250704158588636
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group attached to one of the rings.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. **Naphthalene Core**: 
   - The molecule **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **-0.69506784**.
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (1,2-dimethylbenzene) has a property value of **-0.0774055**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) also has a property value of **-0.0774055**, suggesting that adding methyl groups to benzene increases the property value (less negative).

2. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (1,2-dimethylnaphthalene) has a property value of **0.87899962**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex fused ring system) has a property value of **0.51242113**.
   - The molecule **CCc1ccccc1** (ethylbenzene) has a property value of **0.90681437**, which is higher than benzene, indicating that alkylation increases the property.

3. **Methyl-Substituted Naphthalenes**:
   - The target molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (1-methylnaphthalene) is structurally similar to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (1,2-dimethylnaphthalene), which has a property value of **0.87899962**. 
   - Since 1-methylnaphthalene has one fewer methyl group than 1,2-dimethylnaphthalene, we might expect its property value to be slightly lower but still positive.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Adding methyl groups to aromatic systems increases the property value (e.g., benzene to toluene or xylene).
- Fused ring systems (like naphthalene) tend to have higher property values than single-ring systems.
- The presence of a methyl group on naphthalene (as in **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**) gives a high positive value (~0.88).

For **1-methylnaphthalene (Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1)**, the property value should be **slightly lower than 0.87899962** but still in the same range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of **0.7 to 0.8**. If more precise trends were discernible (e.g., linear relationships with molecular weight or substituent counts), a more exact value could be derived. 

However, given the data, **0.75** is a plausible prediction for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.92983608**. The presence of this core suggests a strongly negative property value.
2. **Substituents**: The hydantoin core is substituted with:
   - A **C(C)CCC** group (a branched alkyl chain).
   - A **CC=C** group (an alkenyl substituent).
   - Compared to the example molecule (which has only **CC=C**), this molecule has additional hydrophobic bulk (C(C)CCC), which may slightly modulate the property value.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The hydantoin core is strongly associated with negative property values (e.g., **-0.92983608** for the simpler analog).
- Adding hydrophobic groups (like alkyl chains) tends to reduce the magnitude of negative values (see **CC(C)CO** with **0.73608297** or **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** with **0.90109162**), but the polar hydantoin core dominates.
- The **CC=C** group is present in both the example and the query molecule, so its effect is already accounted for in the baseline value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong negative contribution from the hydantoin core and the slight mitigating effect of the additional alkyl chain, the property value should be **slightly less negative** than the example molecule but still strongly negative. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.85** (rounded from a value between -0.929 and -0.7, considering the structural similarity but increased hydrophobicity).

### Final Answer:
**-0.85** (approximate prediction based on structural analogs).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.32343776065608154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Not directly given, but substituted benzenes provide clues.
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: Property = -0.924 (heavily halogenated, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 0.380 (multiple halogens, but more complex).
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**: Property = -0.895 (alkyl-substituted benzene, electron-donating).
   - **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1**: Property = 0.879 (alkyl-substituted polyaromatic).

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWG)**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (ester + pyridine): Property = 0.883 (EWG effect).
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: Property = -0.924 (strong EWG halogens).
   - **FC(F)(F)** (trifluoromethyl) is a strong EWG, similar to halogens but slightly less than iodine.

3. **Trifluoromethyl (CF3) Group**:
   - The **CF3** group is highly electronegative and inductive but lacks resonance effects. It is less polarizable than iodine or bromine, so its impact might be between simple halogens and alkyl groups.
   - No direct example with **CF3**, but **Cl** and **I** substitutions suggest strong EWG lowers the property (negative values).

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: -0.924 (two strong EWGs).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 0.303 (multiple halogens, but less negative due to complexity).
   - **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has one strong EWG (**CF3**), so the property should be negative but less extreme than **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of **CF3**, but only one substituent on the benzene ring, the property value should be **negative** but not as extreme as heavily halogenated examples. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

From the examples, **CCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (two ester groups on benzene) has a property of **-0.580**, which is somewhat comparable in EWG strength to **CF3**. Thus, I predict:

**Predicted property for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.62** (rounded from -0.615 to match the precision of the given examples). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.62**

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.9182916027685952
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, I can predict its property value. 

### Analysis:
1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a sugar derivative (likely a hexose sugar like glucose or galactose) with multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`).
   - It has a cyclic structure with an oxygen in the ring (pyranose or furanose form).
   - Highly polar due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which can form hydrogen bonds.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Similar to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (linear sugar alcohol, property = **0.71144768**), but the given molecule is cyclic.
   - Cyclic structures with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1**, property = **-0.78565266**) tend to have negative values, but sugars are more hydrophilic.
   - The cyclic structure and additional hydroxyls may lower the property slightly compared to the linear form.

3. **Trends**:
   - Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-NH`) often have negative property values unless they are part of aromatic systems or have other balancing features (e.g., nitro groups).
   - Cyclic sugars with hydroxyls are very polar but may not be as extreme as some of the highly negative examples (e.g., **CCCI**, property = **-0.87898721**).

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity and cyclic structure, the property value is likely **slightly negative but less extreme** than some of the very small or halogenated molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This is based on:
- Similarity to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (0.711) but adjusted for cyclization and additional hydroxyls.
- Comparison with other polyhydroxy compounds like **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-0.785) but accounting for the sugar's more balanced polarity.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 0.1829201142869081
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Given Molecule:
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O): **CC(=O)O** (acetate-like) and **CC(=O)C** (ketone).
   - Hydroxyl groups (**C3(O)** and **C(O)**).
   - A cyclic structure with fused rings (steroid-like or terpene-like scaffold).
   - Conjugated double bond (**C=CC=O**).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **carbonyl groups (C=O)** and **hydroxyl groups (OH)** often have negative property values (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** has +0.711, but **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** has -0.918).
   - Fused ring systems with polar groups (e.g., **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2** has -0.924, **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has +0.543).
   - The presence of **multiple polar groups (C=O, OH)** and **fused rings** suggests a balance between positive and negative contributions.

3. **Steroid-like Examples**:
   - **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has +0.543 (similar fused rings and C=O).
   - **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has -0.051 (similar but with an ester group).

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The given molecule has **more polar groups (2x C=O, 2x OH)** than **CC1(O)CCC...** (+0.543), but also an **ester (CC(=O)OCC)** which may reduce the value (like **CCC(=O)OC...** at -0.051).
   - The **conjugated C=O** might slightly increase the value (similar to aromatic C=O in **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** at +0.121).

### Predicted Property:
Balancing these factors, the property value is likely **between -0.1 and +0.2**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: +0.08**  

This reflects the competing effects of polar groups (lowering the value) and the steroid-like fused ring system (raising the value).

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.6219930247542433
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to be a molecular descriptor or physicochemical property that correlates with structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, polarity, and functional groups. The property values range from approximately -0.93 to 0.92, with trends observable based on the following:

1. **Aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br)** tend to have positive values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` = 0.706, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = -0.364). The presence of multiple halogens can either increase or decrease the value depending on symmetry and substitution patterns.
2. **Polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -CO, -N)** often lead to intermediate values, especially in non-aromatic systems (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` = -0.684).
3. **Aliphatic chains or non-polar groups** tend to have values closer to zero unless combined with other features (e.g., `CCCCCC(O)CC` = -0.0004).
4. **Complex polycyclic systems** with mixed features (e.g., aromatic + aliphatic + polar) can vary widely but often have moderate values (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` = 0.632).

### Target Molecule: `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`
This is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with:
- A **ketone group (`C=O`)**.
- A **hydroxyl group (`-OH`)**.
- Mostly aliphatic, non-aromatic rings.
- No halogens or strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of a polar ketone and hydroxyl group but lack of aromaticity or halogens, this molecule is likely to have a **moderate negative value**, similar to other aliphatic polycyclic systems with polar groups in the examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` = -0.684). However, the additional ketone might slightly raise the value compared to purely hydroxylated cases.

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  
(Rationale: Between `-0.684` and `-0.0004`, leaning toward the former due to structural similarity but adjusted for the ketone's influence.)

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3936362071926118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the benzene ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which will polarize the aromatic ring.
   - The acetamide group is moderately polar (due to the amide NH and C=O) but less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (0.667)**: Contains an aldehyde (C=O) and methoxy group (electron-donating). The nitro group in our molecule is more electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value slightly compared to this.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (0.264)**: Nitrobenzene, which has a nitro group but no additional polar substituents. Our molecule has an additional acetamide group, which may increase the property value slightly.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.281)**: Similar to nitrobenzene but with a methoxy group (electron-donating). Our molecule has an acetamide instead, which is less electron-donating than methoxy but still polar.
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O (0.349)**: Contains a nitro group and a heterocyclic amide. The property value is higher than nitrobenzene due to additional polar groups.

4. **Expected Property Value**:
   - The nitro group alone (as in nitrobenzene) gives ~0.264.
   - The acetamide group adds polarity but is not as strongly electron-withdrawing as the nitro group. 
   - The combined effect of acetamide and nitro substituents on the aromatic ring is likely to result in a property value slightly higher than nitrobenzene but lower than molecules with more strongly polar or electron-donating groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is:

**0.35** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

This aligns with the trend where additional polar groups (like acetamide) increase the property value compared to nitrobenzene but not as much as strongly electron-donating groups (like methoxy).

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.563600488418558
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, halogens), and structural complexity (e.g., ring systems, branching, conjugation). The property values range from negative (e.g., for simple aliphatic or halogenated compounds) to positive (e.g., for aromatic or polycyclic systems with polar groups).

The molecule in question is:  
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**  

### Key structural features:  
1. **Aromatic system**: Contains a fused aromatic ring (benzofuran-like) with a chlorine substituent (electron-withdrawing).  
2. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Polar and bulky, likely contributing to a higher property value.  
3. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC=O)**: Polar and conjugated with the aromatic system.  
4. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Moderately polar but not as impactful as the other features.  

### Comparison to similar examples:  
- **Cl-substituted aromatics**:  
  - `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` → 0.156  
  - `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` → -0.364  
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → 0.930 (unusually high; likely an outlier or error).  
- **Fused aromatic systems**:  
  - `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` → -0.931 (unusually low; may be due to steric hindrance).  
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C` → -0.568 (similar polar groups but aliphatic).  
- **Polar/heteroatom-rich systems**:  
  - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` → 0.930 (high due to aromaticity + polar groups).  

### Prediction:  
The molecule has a mix of aromaticity (positive contribution), polar P=S and C=O groups (positive), and a Cl substituent (moderate). However, the thiocarbamate and phosphorothioate may introduce steric/electronic effects that temper the value.  

**Estimated property value: 0.45**  
(Closer to mid-range due to competing effects, similar to `CC34CC(=O)C1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4(=O)` at 0.435).

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity), this is an empirical guess based on trends in the data. The value could refine with more context.*

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.7183212317394699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O)**:
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) or ethers (**-O-**) often have property values that are moderately positive or negative, depending on other substituents. For example:
     - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a value of **0.73608297**.
     - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a polyol) has a value of **0.71144768**.
     - **CCCC(O)CCC** (a hexanol derivative) has a value of **0.90703941**.
   - However, if the oxygen is part of a more complex or electronegative group (e.g., nitro, carbonyl), the property may trend more negative (e.g., **ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O** has **-0.85724466**).

2. **Branching/Alkyl Groups**:
   - Highly branched alkanes or alkyl groups tend to have negative or near-zero property values unless offset by polar groups like **-OH**. For example:
     - **CCC** (propane) has **-0.08156871**.
     - **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (a branched octanol) has **-0.90768526**.
   - Branching alone (without polar groups) seems to reduce the property value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a value of **0.73608297**. This is a 4-carbon branched alcohol.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (neopentyl alcohol) is similar but with an additional **-CH3** group (more branching). The additional branching would likely reduce the property value slightly compared to isobutanol.
   - **CC(C)CO** (0.736) vs. **CCCC(O)CCC** (0.907) suggests that linear alcohols have higher values than branched ones.

### Prediction for CC(C)(C)CO:
- This is neopentyl alcohol, a more branched version of isobutanol. The additional **-C(CH3)3** branching should reduce the property value compared to isobutanol but not as drastically as non-polar branched alkanes (since it still has an **-OH** group).
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **CC(C)CO**'s value of **0.73608297**, but still positive due to the **-OH** group. 

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is approximately **0.65**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be related to hydrophobicity, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend seems consistent with branching and polarity effects.)

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.6905715183279851
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** by analyzing structural features and trends in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Nitrogen-rich heterocycles** (especially those with multiple nitrogens, like purine-like structures) tend to have **negative property values**. For example:
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` → **-0.87285559**
   - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` → **-0.86746031**
   - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` → **-0.43174084** (less negative due to methoxy group).

2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** in heterocycles (like in the given molecule) often correlate with more negative values, especially when paired with NH groups (e.g., amides/imides).

3. The given molecule is a **purine-2,6-dione-like structure** (hypoxanthine analog) with:
   - Two carbonyls (C=O at positions 2 and 6).
   - Multiple nitrogens in a fused ring system.
   - NH groups (hydrogen bond donors).

4. Similar molecules in the dataset with fused N-heterocycles + C=O/NH:
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` → **-0.87285559** (very similar, just missing one ring).
   - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` → **-0.86746031** (similar motif).

### Prediction:
The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is highly analogous to the above examples, with even more hydrogen-bonding capacity and aromatic nitrogen density. Thus, I expect its property value to be **strongly negative**, close to the other N-heterocycle examples.

### Estimated Value:
Given the consistency of the dataset for such structures, I predict:  
**Property value ≈ -0.87** (likely between -0.85 and -0.90).  

A precise estimate would be:  
**-0.869** (aligning closely with `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`).  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.869**
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6492456676204522
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols/Ethers**:
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (heptan-2-ol): 0.907  
     - A simple alcohol with a moderate chain length has a high positive value.
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 0.407  
     - A branched alcohol has a lower but still positive value.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** (ethyl isopropyl ether): -0.345  
     - An ether has a negative value, suggesting ethers may lower the property compared to alcohols.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): -0.664  
     - A phosphate ester has a strongly negative value.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ester): -0.051  
     - A complex ester has a near-zero value.
   - **COc1cc(C=O)cc1** (anisaldehyde): 0.667  
     - An aldehyde with an ether group has a high positive value, but the aldehyde may dominate.

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is a simple ester (methyl acetate) with a small aliphatic chain and a carbonyl group.
   - Esters in the examples tend to have negative or near-zero values (e.g., triethyl phosphate at -0.664, steroid ester at -0.051).
   - The presence of the **C=O** (carbonyl) in an ester seems to reduce the property compared to alcohols or ethers.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple alcohols have positive values (e.g., isopropanol at 0.407).
- Ethers have slightly negative values (e.g., ethyl isopropyl ether at -0.345).
- Esters tend to have more negative values (e.g., triethyl phosphate at -0.664).

**Methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O)** is a small ester, so its property value is likely negative but not as extreme as larger or more complex esters. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.3 and -0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.45** (a middle-ground value for a small ester, considering the trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.29671795090688363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (i.e., **N,N'-diphenylurea**). Ureas often exhibit moderate polarity due to the carbonyl (C=O) and NH groups.
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Two benzene rings (phenyl groups) are present, which are hydrophobic but can contribute to π-π stacking interactions.
3. **Polarity**: The C=O and NH groups introduce hydrogen-bonding capability, but the two bulky phenyl rings may reduce overall polarity compared to smaller polar substituents.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **N-phenyl groups**: Similar to molecules like `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (property = 0.763) or `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (property = 0.143), but with two phenyl rings instead of one.
   - **Urea-like structures**: Compare to `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (property = -0.066), but this is cyclic and less aromatic.
   - **Aromaticity**: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `Cc1cccc2ccccc12`, property = 0.058) tend to have modest property values unless highly substituted with polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between:
- The polar urea core (increasing the property value),
- The two hydrophobic phenyl rings (decreasing the property value), and
- The lack of strongly electron-withdrawing/donating substituents (e.g., NO₂, OH, halogens),

The property value is likely **moderate and positive**, similar to other phenyl-substituted polar compounds in the examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This aligns with:
- Lower than highly polar molecules like `OCC(O)CO` (0.930) or `NC(=S)N` (0.892),
- Higher than nonpolar aliphatics like `C1CCCCC1` (-0.905),
- Close to other phenyl-containing polar compounds (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` at 0.143, but adjusted upward for the second phenyl ring). 

Thus, **0.45** is a chemically plausible prediction.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of:
- Two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). 
- It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant aromatic character and planarity.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (property: -0.62561329): This is a larger, more complex polycyclic aromatic system (likely a higher fused ring system like pyrene or similar). The property is negative and moderately large in magnitude.
   - **Sc1ccccc1** (property: 0.46191815): Thiophene (aromatic heterocycle) has a positive property value.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.16362273): A diazo compound with two phenyl groups has a small negative value.
   - **CNc1ccccc1** (property: 0.9184468): Aniline derivative (aromatic + polar group) has a high positive value.

2. **Fluorene-like Systems**:
   - Fluorene is smaller and less conjugated than the large PAH (c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1) but more aromatic and planar than simple benzene derivatives. It lacks heteroatoms or highly polar groups, so its property should be intermediate.

3. **Trends**:
   - Pure aromatic hydrocarbons without polar groups tend to have small to moderate property values, often negative (e.g., **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** at -0.62561329).
   - Fluorene is more conjugated than biphenyl or naphthalene but less than larger PAHs. Its central ring adds slight strain but maintains aromaticity.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, fluorene's property value is likely **negative but smaller in magnitude** than the large PAH. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This aligns with its aromaticity, lack of polar groups, and intermediate size compared to the given examples.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.9108586272665904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **Sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N)**: Highly polar and often associated with moderate to high property values (e.g., see molecules with sulfonamides or similar polar groups in the examples).
   - **Guanidine-like (NC(=N)N)**: Very polar and basic, likely to increase the property value.
   - **Aromatic amine (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Adds polarity and electron density.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The presence of a benzene ring with an amine substituent suggests some hydrophobicity but balanced by the polar groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with polar groups like sulfonamides, amides, or amines tend to have property values in the **0.3 to 0.8 range** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12` has 0.702, `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has 0.706).
   - The guanidine-like group is even more polar than typical amines, which might push the value higher.
   - However, the sulfonamide is electron-withdrawing, which could moderate the effect.

4. **No Strongly Hydrophobic Regions**:
   - Unlike molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` with -0.782), this molecule lacks large hydrophobic regions, so the value should not be negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of strong polar groups (sulfonamide + guanidine-like + aromatic amine) and no significant hydrophobic regions, the property value is likely in the **upper-middle range** of the polar examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities to the provided examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.9022706390895837
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features. Here's the analysis:

1. **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, CF₃, halogens)** tend to decrease the property value (more negative).  
2. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents** (e.g., NO₂, OH) can vary but often decrease the value unless balanced by other features.  
3. **Aliphatic chains and nonpolar groups** (e.g., CCCC) generally lead to negative values.  
4. **Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., OH, COOH, OMe)** can increase the value if not outweighed by electron-withdrawing effects.  

### Target Molecule:  
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**  

Key features:  
- **Two NO₂ groups (strong electron-withdrawing)** → Strongly decreases property.  
- **CF₃ group (highly electron-withdrawing)** → Further decreases property.  
- **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))** → Slight positive contribution, but outweighed by NO₂/CF₃.  
- **Alkene (C=C)** → Minimal impact.  

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:  
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (-0.823)** → Two Cl on aromatics.  
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1 (-0.824)** → Polar but with electron-withdrawing groups.  
- **Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl (-0.798)** → NO-like and Cl.  

This molecule has **two NO₂ groups + CF₃**, which are even stronger electron-withdrawing than most examples. Thus, the property should be **more negative** than most listed.  

### Predicted Property:  
**-0.92** (similar to highly electron-deficient aromatics like c1ccccc1O (-0.928) but adjusted for extra NO₂/CF₃).  

### Final Answer:  
**-0.92** (estimated range: -0.90 to -0.95).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6492456676204522
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: 
     - Molecules with aldehyde (e.g., **CCCC=O**, property = 0.89192813) or ketone (e.g., **CC(=O)N**, property = -0.45752682) groups show varying property values. The property seems more positive for simple aldehydes and more negative for ketones or amides.
   - **Ester (COO)**: 
     - Esters like **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (property = 0.88316672) and **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property = -0.57480409) show a wide range, but the presence of aromatic rings or nitrogen seems to lower the value.
   - **Ether (COC)**: 
     - Ethers like **CC(C)SC(C)C** (property = 0.78339766) and **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (property = 0.92615113) tend to have positive values, especially if combined with other simple groups.
   - **Branched vs. Linear Chains**: 
     - Branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)(C)O**, property = -0.72923843) often have lower (more negative) values compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O**, property = 0.90703941).

2. **Specific Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide) has a property of -0.45752682.
   - **CCCC=O** (pentanal) has a property of 0.89192813.
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) is not directly in the list, but **CCC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol) has a property of -0.72923843, and **CCCCCC(C)O** (2-heptanol) has 0.90703941.

3. **CC(C)OC=O (Methyl isopropoxyformate)**:
   - This is an ester with a branched alkoxy group (isopropoxy) and a formyl (C=O) group.
   - Compared to **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate, property = 0.92615113), the branching (**CC(C)O** instead of **CCO**) might reduce the property value slightly.
   - The formyl group (C=O) is similar to aldehydes, which tend to have higher positive values (e.g., **CCCC=O** = 0.89192813).

### Prediction:
Given the ester-like structure with branching, the property value is likely positive but lower than simpler linear esters or aldehydes. A reasonable estimate would be between **0.5 and 0.8**. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (linear ester) = 0.92615113
- **CC(C)SC(C)C** (branched thioether) = 0.78339766
- **CCCC=O** (linear aldehyde) = 0.89192813

The branching in **CC(C)OC=O** might reduce the value compared to linear analogs, so a plausible prediction is around **0.7**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **0.71**.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.8335984474881905
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features:

1. **Aromatic rings with hydroxyl (-OH) groups** tend to have negative property values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` = -0.733, `c1ccccc1O` = -0.927).
2. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CC(C)C` = 0.924, `CC(C)CC(C)C` = 0.635) tend to have positive property values.
3. **Chlorinated aromatics** show mixed trends, but heavily chlorinated systems often have positive values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` = 0.379).
4. **Polar or functionalized groups** (e.g., -NO2, -S(=O)=O, -N=O) often increase the property value toward positive numbers.

The molecule in question is **`Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`**:
- It is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (aromatic ring with -OH and -CH3 groups).
- It has **one hydroxyl group** and **two methyl groups** on the aromatic ring.
- Compared to `c1ccccc1O` (property = -0.927), the addition of methyl groups typically reduces the magnitude of the negative property (methyl groups are weakly electron-donating but not as polar as -OH).

From similar examples:
- `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (no -OH) has a positive value (0.884), but adding -OH significantly reduces the property.
- `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (multiple -OH groups) = -0.733.
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) = -0.927.

Given that `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` has **one -OH and two -CH3 groups**, the property should be **less negative than phenol but still negative** due to the dominant effect of the -OH group. 

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  
*(Estimated based on interpolation between phenol (-0.927) and methyl-substituted aromatics with fewer polar groups.)*

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.3123149733691457
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)(OC)** group (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) have property values ranging from **-0.115 to 0.740**. 
   - The presence of **electron-withdrawing substituents (Cl, Br, I)** tends to increase the property value (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a high value of **0.740**).

2. **Aromatic Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with **electron-donating groups (e.g., -OCH3, -CH3)** tend to have moderate to high positive values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` has **0.833**).
   - Aromatic rings with **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -Cl, -NO2)** can have either positive or negative values depending on the balance of substituents.

3. **Thioether Group (-SC)**:
   - The presence of **-SC** (thioether) in the aromatic ring is not directly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups often have moderate effects. For instance, `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.596**, but this also includes a strongly electron-withdrawing sulfonamide.

4. **Overall Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule has:
     - A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC))**, which is present in other molecules with varying property values.
     - An aromatic ring with **-SC (thioether)** and **-CH3 (methyl)**, which are moderately electron-donating.
     - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like -Cl or -NO2) to push the value higher.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (with 3 Cl atoms) has a high value of **0.740**.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` (with 2 Cl and 1 Br) has a value of **-0.115**.
- The target molecule has no halogens but has **-SC** and **-CH3**, which are less electron-withdrawing than halogens. Thus, the value is likely lower than the high-scoring phosphorothioates but not as negative as some others.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of moderately electron-donating groups (-SC, -CH3) and the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is approximately:

**0.25** (moderate positive value, similar to other phosphorothioates with mixed substituents). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking more closely, the closest analog is `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` (-0.115), but without halogens, the value should be higher. A reasonable prediction is:

**0.35** (between the low phosphorothioate values and the higher ones with halogens). 

However, considering the methyl group's slight positive contribution, the final predicted value is:

**0.40** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is **0.40**.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.9299581341368565
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` by comparing its structural features to the molecules in the dataset and identifying trends.

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a property value of **0.37957867**.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a property value of **0.65002068**.
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a property value of **-0.13586973** (less chlorinated and has an OH group).
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has a property value of **0.72793934** (less chlorinated and has an OH group).

2. **General trends**:
   - Increasing chlorination tends to increase the property value (compare the two highly chlorinated examples above).
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., OH, NO2, COOH) can significantly affect the property, sometimes lowering it.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
The target molecule is `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`. It is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with:
- 6 chlorine atoms (similar to the two highly chlorinated examples above).
- No polar or functional groups other than Cl.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
1. `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (5 Cl atoms): **0.37957867**.
2. `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (7 Cl atoms): **0.65002068**.

The target molecule has 6 Cl atoms, intermediate between these two. The property seems to increase with more chlorination, so we can interpolate between these two values.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the property for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (6 Cl atoms) should be between **0.37957867** and **0.65002068**, likely closer to the higher end because the chlorination is still extensive. 

A reasonable estimate would be around **0.55**.

### Final predicted property value:
**0.55** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures).

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6827054221516431
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane) and compare it to similar structures in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have property values in the **negative to slightly positive range**, depending on the rest of the structure.
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.68262515** (highly negative due to multiple nitro groups).
   - Example: `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (no nitro group) has a high positive value (**0.91081821**), while nitro-substituted aromatics are less positive or negative.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`) have slightly negative values (e.g., `CCC` = **-0.08156871**).
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC`) have more negative values (**-0.88465612**).

3. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` has a **3-carbon alkyl chain + nitro group**.
   - Similar examples:
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has **-0.8933076**, but this is more complex (multiple nitro groups and aromatic rings).
     - `CCCCCC=O` (alkyl + carbonyl) has **-0.69061176**.
     - `CC(C)CCOC=O` (branched alkyl + carbonyl) has **-0.31426297**.

### Prediction:
- The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and tends to reduce the property value.
- The short alkyl chain (propyl) is not as strongly negative as longer chains.
- Given the balance between the nitro group and the short alkyl chain, the value is likely **moderately negative**.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction for **CCCN(=O)=O** is **-0.45**.

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trends in the dataset. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.5830808317568394
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often have moderate property values, but the exact value depends on other factors like the presence of additional functional groups or aromaticity.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of **0.44615456**, which is a disubstituted benzene with Cl and Br.
   - Example: **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** and **COc1ccccc1Cl** both have the same value (**0.75474431**), suggesting that the position of Cl (ortho vs. para) does not drastically change the property in this case.

2. **Fluorine vs. Other Halogens**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl or Br, which may slightly lower the property value compared to Cl/Br-substituted analogs.
   - Example: **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has a value of **-0.0956623**, but this also includes an amide group, which complicates direct comparison.

3. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - Bromine tends to increase the property value compared to no substitution (e.g., **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12** has **0.87178271**).
   - In **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, the presence of Br may push the value higher, but F may counteract this slightly.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with halogens tend to have positive property values unless other polar/negative groups are present (e.g., **NC(=O)N** has **-0.75190095** due to the urea group).

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.44615456 (Cl and Br on benzene)
- **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 0.75474431 (Cl and OMe on benzene)
- **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: 0.87178271 (Br on naphthalene)

Given that **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a benzene ring with F and Br substituents, it is most similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but with F instead of Cl. Since F is more electronegative than Cl, it may slightly reduce the property value compared to the Cl/Br case. However, Br is still present, which tends to increase the value.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.44615456)** but still positive. 

**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: ~0.40**  
(For specificity, we can choose **0.40** as a rounded estimate.) 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.446
- **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**: F is more electronegative than Cl, so the value might be ~10% lower.  
Thus: **0.446 * 0.9 ≈ 0.40**.

Alternatively, if we consider that F is smaller and may have less steric impact, the value could be closer to the Cl/Br case. For a more precise estimate, we might average the Cl/Br case (0.446) and a hypothetical F-only case (assuming F alone would give ~0.3 based on other examples), leading to ~0.37.

**Final predicted value: 0.38** (a balanced estimate between the above reasoning). 

However, since the examples show that Br tends to increase the value significantly, and F is not drastically reducing it, **0.40** is a reasonable and defensible prediction. 

### Exact Prediction:
Given the data and trends, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is:  
**0.40**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolation of the given examples. If more context were available, the estimate could be refined further.)

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is **0.40**.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.8911421951136449
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -N-, -C=O, -Cl, -Br)** tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., -0.46299722 for CBr, -0.920349 for CCCCBr, -0.40272535 for CCCC(C)(C)O).
   - Molecules with **nonpolar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains, aromatic rings without polar substituents)** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.72850149 for CCCCCCCCCC(C)O, 0.76123069 for CCCCCC(=O)C).
   - **Steroids and complex polycyclic structures** with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.90979016 for the large steroid-like molecule), while those with fewer polar groups or more hydrophobic regions tend to have **positive values** (e.g., 0.84347959 for the similar steroid-like molecule with fewer polar groups).

2. **Specific Features in the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is a **bicyclic structure** with:
     - Two **tertiary carbons (C1 and C1 with methyl groups)**.
     - One **hydroxyl group (-OH)**, which is polar.
     - No other strongly polar or charged groups.
     - A mostly **hydrocarbon framework**, which is hydrophobic.

3. **Comparison with Similar Examples**:
   - The molecule resembles **steroid-like structures** in the examples (e.g., CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO with a value of -0.90979016). However, it is much simpler and lacks multiple polar groups (e.g., no ketones or additional -OH groups).
   - The presence of **one -OH group** and **hydrocarbon bulk** suggests a balance between polar and nonpolar contributions. Similar simpler structures with -OH (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)O) have **negative values (-0.40272535)**, but larger hydrophobic frameworks can push the value toward positive (e.g., 0.72850149 for CCCCCCCCCC(C)O).

### Prediction:
Given the **single -OH group** and the **bulky hydrophobic framework**, the property value is likely **slightly negative** but not as strongly negative as molecules with multiple polar groups. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This balances the polar -OH contribution with the nonpolar bicyclic structure.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.5731958196316619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a key functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = -0.16025531). The presence of P(=S) with alkoxy groups (OCC) suggests a moderate influence on the property, likely negative but not extremely so.
   
2. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure, which is polar and can contribute to the property value. Similar structures in the examples (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** with property = 0.1432089) suggest that this group can push the property toward slightly positive or near-zero values.

3. **Combined structure**: The molecule is a hybrid of a phosphorothioate and a phthalimide. The phosphorothioate tends to lower the property (as seen in the example with property = -0.16025531), while the phthalimide may raise it slightly. The net effect is likely a compromise between these two influences.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**: Property = -0.16025531. This is very similar but has an additional SC(CCl) group, which may slightly lower the property further. Removing this group (as in the target molecule) would likely raise the property slightly.
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1**: Property = 0.1432089. This is a simpler lactam, and the target's phthalimide is more conjugated but similar in nature.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely slightly more positive than -0.16025531 (due to the absence of the SC(CCl) group) but still negative or near-zero due to the phosphorothioate's influence. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.10 to 0.10**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.05** (a compromise between the phosphorothioate's negative contribution and the phthalimide's slight positive contribution). 

This is a rough estimate based on structural analogies and trends in the given data. For higher precision, statistical modeling or more examples would be needed.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.30463938777276395
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core with two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring (one of which is adjacent to a carbonyl group, C=O). This is similar to the structure **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.909), but with an aromatic substitution pattern.
2. **Aromatic Substitution**: It has two aromatic rings (one benzene and one pyridine-like ring with a carbonyl). This is somewhat analogous to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = -0.930), which also has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of the carbonyl (C=O) and nitrogen atoms suggests moderate polarity, which often correlates with negative property values in the given examples (e.g., carbonyl-containing molecules like **CCCCOC** = -0.770 or **CCCCI** = +0.493 lacks polar groups).
4. **Symmetry/Conjugation**: The extended conjugation between the rings and the carbonyl may stabilize the molecule, potentially lowering the property value (as seen in other conjugated systems like **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** = +0.284).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = -0.930) is very close in structure (fused aromatic + carbonyl), but our target molecule has a non-fused, more flexible linkage between rings.
- **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.909) shares the carbonyl/amide motif but is more aliphatic.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.618) is less aromatic but has similar polar groups.

Given the balance between aromaticity, polarity, and flexibility, the property value is likely **negative** but less extreme than the fused-ring example (-0.930). 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.75**. This accounts for:
- The carbonyl's contribution (similar to **CCCCOC** = -0.77).
- The aromatic conjugation (less negative than fused rings but more than aliphatic cases).
- The methyl substitutions (slightly increasing hydrophobicity, raising the value slightly compared to pure polar aromatics).

Thus, the predicted property for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is:  
**-0.75** (approximate).

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.12127279503374928
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, amines, or carbonyls) tend to have more negative values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` = -0.629, `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` = -0.733).
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCC(=C)C` = -0.295, `CCCCC` = -0.327) have less negative values.
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) can increase or decrease the value depending on context (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` = +0.379, but `Clc1ccccc1I` = -0.924).

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Esters (`COC=O` = -0.871, `CCOC(=O)N` = +0.863) show variability, but simple aliphatic esters tend to be negative.
   - Ketones/aldehydes (e.g., `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2` = -0.926) are strongly negative.

3. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCC` = -0.327) are less negative than shorter polar molecules.
   - Branching may slightly increase the value (e.g., `CCC(C)C` = -0.713 vs. linear chains).

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatics with polar substituents (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1` = -0.418) are negative, while nonpolar aromatics (e.g., `Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13` = +0.512) can be positive.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- **Structure**: Hexanoic acid ethyl ester (ethyl hexanoate). It has:
  - A 6-carbon aliphatic chain (`CCCCCC`).
  - An ester group (`C(=O)OCC`), which is polar but less polar than free acids or alcohols.
- **Comparable Examples**:
  - `COC=O` (methyl formate) = -0.871 (simple ester, very negative).
  - `CCOC(=O)N` (ethyl carbamate) = +0.863 (amide-like ester, positive).
  - `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl hexanoate) = +0.507 (long-chain ester, positive).
- **Prediction**:
  - The long aliphatic chain reduces polarity compared to small esters like `COC=O`.
  - The closest analog is `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl hexanoate) = +0.507. Replacing `OCH3` with `OCH2CH3` (ethyl) should not drastically change the value, but may slightly reduce it due to increased chain length.

### Final Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is approximately **+0.45**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on the trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.7988918257921259
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule is an ester (methyl benzoate) with a phenyl ring and a carboxylate group (COO-). This is similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-0.64228543**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), which has a property value of **-0.91861587**.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the phenyl ring and ester group tends to give negative property values in the range of **-0.6 to -0.9**.
   - The hydroxyl group in **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** makes the property more negative (-0.918), while the simple ester **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is less negative (-0.642).
   - Since **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is structurally almost identical to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly shorter alkyl chain (methyl instead of ethyl), its property value should be very close but perhaps slightly less negative due to the reduced hydrophobic contribution.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be slightly higher (less negative) than **-0.64228543** (ethyl benzoate), likely in the range of **-0.60 to -0.63**.

### Final Predicted Property Value: **-0.62** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

For higher precision, I would compare more examples, but this is a reasonable estimate given the data.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.2635393863748423
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, halogenation, functional groups, and molecular size. Let's analyze the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene) in this context:

1. **Structure**: It is a simple conjugated diene with no heteroatoms, halogens, or aromatic rings.  
2. **Comparison to similar molecules**:  
   - **CC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene) has a property value of **-0.29596386**.  
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene, with an aromatic ring) has a value of **0.00062373**.  
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, with an aromatic ring and a double bond) has a value of **0.92891711**.  

Since **C=CCC=C** lacks aromaticity or polar functional groups but has conjugation (which increases polarity slightly compared to isolated alkenes), its property value should be:  
- Higher than **CC/C=C/C** (less conjugated) but lower than aromatic systems.  
- Similar to or slightly higher than simple aliphatic alkenes.  

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: ~0.1 to 0.3**  

A reasonable estimate based on the trend is:  
**0.215**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a synthetic score—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.5960067186075495
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a halogenated alkane with F, Cl, and Br) has a property value of **-0.12646989**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a heavily chlorinated aromatic) has a value of **0.65002068**, but this is an aromatic system, which behaves differently.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated methane, analogous to chloroform (CHCl₃) but with bromine.

2. **Electronegativity and Polarizability**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but more polarizable. Fully halogenated small alkanes (like CHCl₃ or CBr₃) tend to have negative property values when halogens are electronegative (e.g., F, Cl), but bromine's polarizability might reduce this effect slightly.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a mix of F, Cl, and Br and a slightly negative value (-0.126). 
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is fully brominated, which may lead to a similar or slightly more negative value due to the lack of lighter halogens (F or Cl).

4. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic halogenated compounds (e.g., Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1) tend to have positive values, but aliphatic halogenated compounds (like BrC(Br)Br) are more likely to have negative values.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **BrC(Br)Br** is expected to have a slightly negative property value, similar to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but potentially more negative due to the absence of lighter halogens. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: -0.15** (approximately between -0.1 and -0.2). 

This aligns with the behavior of other small, fully halogenated alkanes in the dataset.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.16025531351064753
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.6995124). This group often contributes negatively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, similar to many examples (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** with property = -0.91095213). Aromaticity alone tends to lower the value, but substitution can modulate this.
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present as **C(CCl)**, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = -0.66343734). Halogens often decrease the property value.
4. **Lactam/Carbonyl (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: A cyclic amide/carbonyl system, similar to **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (property = 0.28462586). Such polar groups can increase the value.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP, OCC)**: Present, similar to **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = 0.28133626). Alkoxy groups can slightly increase the value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines features of **phosphorothioate** (negative contribution), **aromatic + carbonyl** (mixed contributions), and **chlorine** (negative). 
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.6995124), which shares the P(=S) group, aromatic ring, and chlorine. However, our molecule has additional polar groups (lactam, ethoxy) that may offset the negative contribution slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of negative (P(=S), Cl) and positive (lactam, ethoxy) contributions, the property value is likely **slightly less negative** than -0.6995124 but still negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This aligns with the trends observed in the examples, where similar functional groups yield values in this range.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.15211657813633317
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide-like group**: `CN(C)C(=O)N` (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)C` in the examples, which has a value of -0.0346).
   - **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, which has a value of 0.7325, but note the nitro group here is electron-withdrawing).
   - **Heterocyclic fragment**: `n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` (this resembles a fused heterocycle with carbonyl and bulky tert-butyl groups; similar to `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23`, which has a value of 0.9096, but this is more complex).
   - The molecule has a mix of polar (amide, Cl, heterocycle) and nonpolar (tert-butyl) groups.

2. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalizing Effects**:
   - The amide (`C(=O)N`) and the heterocycle with `C=O` are electron-withdrawing.
   - The chlorine on the aromatic ring is moderately electron-withdrawing.
   - The tert-butyl group is electron-donating but sterically bulky.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with amides (`CN(C)C(=O)C`) tend to have small-magnitude values (e.g., -0.0346).
   - Chlorinated aromatics with additional polar groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have positive values (~0.7325).
   - Bulky heterocycles (e.g., `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23`) have high positive values (~0.9096).
   - However, the presence of multiple polar/electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, amide, heterocycle C=O) may counteract the bulky tert-butyl effect.

### Prediction:
Given the mix of polar/electron-withdrawing groups and bulky substituents, the molecule is likely to have a **moderate positive property value**, but not as high as some of the purely bulky heterocycles. 

Looking at similar examples:
- `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (similar amide) has 0.1486.
- `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (polar aromatic) has 0.8448.
- `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (chlorinated aromatic) has 0.3031.

The given molecule is more polar than `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` but less polar than `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`. A reasonable estimate would be between **0.2 and 0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.3124** (a balance between the amide's small effect and the polar/steric contributions of the rest of the molecule).

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.8711185081985374
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core with multiple Cl substitutions**: The molecule consists of two phenol rings (hydroxyl-substituted benzene) linked by an oxygen bridge (O), with multiple chlorine substitutions. 
   - Similar examples:
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property: 0.72793934)
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: -0.13586973)
   - The presence of multiple Cl substitutions tends to increase hydrophobicity/electron-withdrawing effects, but the exact impact depends on the pattern.

2. **Symmetry and additional substitutions**: The molecule is symmetric with two phenol rings and three Cl atoms total (one on one ring, two on the other). This is somewhat similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** but with an extra Cl and an additional phenol ring.

3. **Polarity and hydrogen bonding**: The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups can form hydrogen bonds, which may lower the property value (as seen in **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** where multiple Cl and OH groups result in a negative value). However, the oxygen bridge adds some flexibility and reduces polarity slightly.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.72793934), but the additional Cl and phenol ring in the target molecule will modify this. 
- The symmetric structure with multiple Cl/OH groups may pull the value toward the middle of the observed range for such compounds (e.g., between 0.727 and -0.135). 

### Prediction:
Given the balance between:
- Increased Cl substitutions (tending toward negative values, as in **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**),
- Additional phenol ring (adding polarity but also bulk),
- Symmetry (may stabilize the property value),

I predict a value slightly lower than **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** but not as extreme as **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**. 

**Predicted property: 0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on interpolation between the given examples.)* 

However, looking more carefully, the molecule is a dimer of **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** with an extra Cl, and dimerization often reduces the property (as seen in other examples where larger structures have lower values). Thus, a more conservative estimate might be closer to **0.30**. 

But given that **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** is 0.727 and the fully Cl-substituted version is -0.135, this molecule (with 3 Cl total) might split the difference. 

**Final predicted property: 0.35**  
*(This balances the effects of the additional Cl and the extended structure.)* 

However, reviewing the examples again, **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (a biphenyl with 2 Cl) has a value of -0.823, which is very low, suggesting that extended aromatic systems with Cl substitutions can drastically reduce the property. Thus, the prediction might need to be lower. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property: 0.20**  
*(This accounts for the competing effects of the OH groups and Cl substitutions.)* 

But to be more precise, given that **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** is 0.727 and **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** is -0.135, and this molecule is intermediate in Cl substitution, a linear interpolation would suggest:  
- 1 Cl: 0.727  
- 3 Cl (on one ring): -0.135  
- This molecule has 3 Cl total (but distributed), so roughly:  
  (0.727 * 2/3) + (-0.135 * 1/3) ≈ 0.44  

But since the structure is more symmetric and extended, I'll adjust downward slightly:  
**Final predicted property: 0.30**  

*(This is my best estimate given the examples.)* 

However, looking at **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (-0.135) and **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (0.727), the target molecule is closer to the former in Cl count but with less symmetry. Thus, a value between these two is likely, perhaps slightly positive. 

**Final answer: 0.25**  

*(After careful consideration, this seems the most reasonable interpolation.)* 

But to be consistent with the trend that more Cl substitutions reduce the value, and given that this molecule has 3 Cl (like **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** but distributed), the value should be closer to 0.0. 

**Revised prediction: 0.10**  

*(This accounts for the competing effects of the OH groups and Cl substitutions more accurately.)* 

After further reflection, the most plausible value based on the examples is:  
**Predicted property: 0.15**  

*(This balances the positive contribution of the OH groups and the negative contribution of the Cl substitutions.)* 

However, given that **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** is 0.727 and **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** is -0.135, and this molecule is intermediate, a weighted average suggests:  
- 1 Cl: 0.727  
- 3 Cl: -0.135  
- This molecule is closer to 3 Cl, so the value should be near 0.0. 

**Final prediction: 0.05**  

*(This is my best estimate given the data.)* 

But looking back at **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (-0.823), which is a biphenyl with 2 Cl, and this molecule is a biphenyl with 3 Cl and 2 OH, the OH groups may raise the value somewhat, leading to:  
**Final answer: 0.10**  

*(This is the most consistent with the examples.)* 

After careful consideration, the predicted property for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:  
**0.10**

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.29596385604295766
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. 

The molecule in question is **CC/C=C\C**, which is a simple unsaturated hydrocarbon (a trans-2-pentene). 

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (a cis-2-butene analog) has a property value of **-0.29596386**.
- **CCCC(=O)OC** (a more complex ester) has a value of **-0.79820577**.
- **CCCC(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **-0.79058018**.
- **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC** (a long alkane) has a value of **-0.31373684**.

For **CC/C=C\C** (trans-2-pentene), we can infer:
1. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) in the examples tend to have less negative values compared to saturated or more polar molecules.
2. The presence of a double bond (as in **CC/C=C/C**) gives a value around **-0.295**, while longer/branched alkanes are more negative.
3. The trans configuration (CC/C=C\C) is slightly less polar than the cis form (CC/C=C/C), but the difference is likely small for this property.

Thus, a reasonable prediction for **CC/C=C\C** would be close to the value for **CC/C=C/C**, but slightly less negative due to the trans configuration. 

**Predicted property value: -0.28** (slightly less negative than the cis analog). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.7709830959959918
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with an ether group tend to have moderate property values, often between -0.5 and 0.5. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` has a value of **0.79207978**, but this is a more complex ether with aromatic rings and other functional groups.
     - `COc1ccccc1O` (anisole-like) has a value of **0.72558037**, but this is also aromatic.
     - Simpler ethers like `CCCOCC` are not directly represented, but we can infer from simpler aliphatic molecules.

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes or aliphatic chains tend to have lower or negative values unless they have polar or electronegative substituents. For example:
     - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) has **0.40671111** due to the -OH group.
     - `CC#C` (propyne) has **-0.56648911** due to the triple bond.
     - `CCCCCCC=C` (heptene) has **0.50699127**, likely due to the double bond.
     - `C1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexane) has **-0.01386084**, a neutral value for a saturated ring.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Aliphatic Molecules**:
   - `CCC(O)CC` (pentanol-like) has **-0.72923843**, but this is an alcohol, which is more polar than an ether.
   - `CC(C)COC(=O)C` (ester) has **-0.31426297**, which is moderately negative.

4. **Symmetry and Size**:
   - `CCCOCC` is a symmetric aliphatic ether with no aromaticity or additional functional groups. Symmetry and lack of strong polar groups suggest a neutral to slightly negative value.

### Prediction for CCCOCC:
- The ether group (-O-) introduces some polarity, but the aliphatic chains (ethyl groups) dominate, pushing the value toward neutral or slightly negative.
- Comparing to similar-sized aliphatic molecules (e.g., `C1CCCCCC1` with **-0.01386084**), the ether oxygen might slightly increase the value, but not drastically.
- No strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present, so the value should be modest.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOCC** is:  
**-0.15** (slightly negative due to aliphatic dominance, but offset slightly by the ether oxygen).

However, looking more closely at the examples, `C1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexane) is **-0.01386084**, and `CC(C)COC(=O)C` (ester) is **-0.31426297**. Since `CCCOCC` is less polar than an ester but more polar than a pure alkane, a value between these two is plausible.  

Thus, a refined estimate is:  
**-0.10 to -0.20**.  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-0.15**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the property's definition.)  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-0.15**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.6494141442656387
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule and predict its property value by comparing its structural features to those of the molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two phenyl rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are also present in many of the examples. Aromatic rings often contribute to negative property values when combined with electronegative or bulky substituents, but neutral or slightly positive values when combined with alkyl or electron-donating groups.
   - Example: `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of **-0.92198549** (two phenyl rings with alkyl substituents).
   - Example: `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` has a value of **0.18118286** (polyaromatic with alkyl groups).

2. **Amide group**: The `N(C(=O)N...)` fragment is a tertiary amide. Amides in the dataset often appear with negative or near-zero values unless balanced by other features.
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` has a value of **-0.55342813** (tertiary amide with aliphatic rings).
   - Example: `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a value of **0.92985794** (tertiary amide with aromatic and heterocyclic groups).

3. **Bulky substituents**: The `C(C)(C)` (tert-butyl) group is bulky and hydrophobic. Bulky alkyl groups can push the property toward positive values if they dominate the molecule's properties.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` has a value of **0.90109162** (bulky alkyl groups with a hydroxyl).
   - Example: `CCCC1C(=O)N3N(C1=O)c2cc(C)ccc2N=C3N(C)C` has a value of **0.92720127** (bulky heterocyclic system).

4. **Tertiary amine**: The `N(C)(C)` fragment is a tertiary amine, which is often associated with positive values when not counteracted by strongly electronegative groups.
   - Example: `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a value of **0.92985794** (tertiary amine with amide and aromatic groups).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
The closest analogs in the dataset are:
- `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (**0.92985794**): Tertiary amide + aromatic rings + heterocycle.
- `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` (**-0.55342813**): Tertiary amide + aliphatic rings.
- `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (**-0.92198549**): Two phenyl rings with alkyl groups.

The given molecule has:
- Two phenyl rings (like `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` but with a more complex substituent).
- A tertiary amide (like `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` but without the heterocycle).
- A bulky tert-butyl group (pushing toward positive values).

### Prediction:
The molecule is likely to have a **positive property value**, similar to `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` but slightly less positive due to the absence of the heterocycle and the presence of the bulky tert-butyl group. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.75** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely between **0.7 and 0.9** given the features.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.028250528800751552
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituents and Functional Groups**:
   - **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Br, NO₂, carbonyls)** tend to increase the property value (more positive).
   - **Electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH₂, alkyl groups)** tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - **Aromatic systems** with polar substituents often have intermediate values, but halogens (Br, Cl) push the value higher.

2. **Examples with Similar Structures**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = 0.90573897): Phenol with a Br substituent (high value due to Br + OH).
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (property = 0.58308083): Aromatic with Br and F (less donating than OH, so lower than phenol-Br).
   - **Cc1ccc(O)cc1C** (property = 0.83359845): Methyl and OH on aromatic (electron-donating CH₃ and OH, but still high due to OH).
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = 0.26361553): Nitro group (strong electron-withdrawing) but no halogen.

3. **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
   - **Acetamido group (CC(=O)N-)**: Moderately electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl, but the NH part can donate slightly.
   - **Bromine (Br)**: Strong electron-withdrawing effect (inductive) but weakly donating via resonance (less than OH/NH₂).
   - The molecule is analogous to **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** but with an acetamido group instead of OH. The acetamido is less donating than OH, so the property value should be slightly lower than 0.90573897 but still positive due to the Br.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is approximately **0.75**. 

This is slightly lower than the phenol-Br analogue (0.905) due to the acetamido group being less donating than OH but still positive due to the Br.

### Final Answer:
**0.75** (estimated based on structural trends in the examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9131615067345056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene)**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have positive property values, especially when substituted with alkyl groups or other non-polar substituents.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1N` (0.884), `C=Cc1ccccc1` (0.928), `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (-0.042), `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (0.058).

2. **Alkyl Substitutions on Aromatic Rings**:
   - The presence of branched alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl) on aromatic rings tends to reduce the property value compared to linear alkyl groups or unsubstituted aromatics.
   - Example: `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (-0.042) vs. `C=Cc1ccccc1` (0.928).

3. **Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-C=O`, `-N`, halogens) often reduce the property value, especially if they are directly attached to the aromatic ring or are part of a larger polar system.

4. **Specific Case for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
   - This molecule is **isobutylbenzene**, where an isobutyl group (`CC(C)C-`) is attached to a benzene ring.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (ethylbenzene with a methyl substituent) has a value of -0.042.
     - `Cc1ccccc1` (toluene) is not in the list, but `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (methylnaphthalene) has 0.058.
     - Branched alkyls like `CC(C)CCO` (-0.718) and `CC(C)CCCO` (-0.418) suggest branching reduces the property.

### Prediction:
- The isobutyl group (`CC(C)C-`) is more branched than ethyl or methyl, which likely reduces the property value further compared to simpler alkylbenzenes.
- However, the aromatic ring still contributes positively, so the value should be slightly negative or near zero.
- From the examples, `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (-0.042) is the closest analog, and branching further (isobutyl) might push the value slightly more negative.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is approximately **-0.15**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples and trends observed. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or additional data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.18956268082586467
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **0.9266** (high positive value)
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): **0.2279** (moderate positive value)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): **0.2458** (moderate positive value)
   - **c1cncnc1** (polar heteroaromatic): **0.7115** (high positive value)
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (nonpolar polyaromatic): **0.6319** (moderate positive value)

   Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -OCH3) tend to have positive property values, while nonpolar aromatic systems (e.g., pure hydrocarbons) have lower or moderate values.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (carbonyl in heterocycle): **-0.0894** (slightly negative)
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (carbonyl in aliphatic system): **-0.7074** (strongly negative)
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **0.9266** (strongly positive)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): **0.7544** (strongly positive)

   Carbonyl groups in aliphatic or nonpolar contexts tend to lower the property value, while in polar/aromatic contexts (e.g., amides, imides), they correlate with higher values.

3. **Benzaldehyde-like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol) but lacks the additional -OH and -NH2 groups. The carbonyl is directly conjugated with the aromatic ring, which is a polarizing feature but less polar than an amide or phenol.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The molecule has an aromatic ring with a polar carbonyl substituent (aldehyde).
- It lacks additional strongly polar groups (like -OH or -NH2), so the property value will be lower than **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.9266) but higher than nonpolar aromatics like **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (0.0583).
- Similar molecules with conjugated carbonyls (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**) have values around **0.75**, but benzaldehyde is less polar than imides or amides.

**Estimated property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: ~0.45 to 0.65**.  
A reasonable prediction is **0.55** (moderate positive value, reflecting the polarizing effect of the aldehyde group on the aromatic ring). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: 0.55**
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.9018628812511946
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions. Let's analyze the target molecule:

**Target Molecule:**  
`O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2`

### Key Features:
1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene-like aromatic ring (`c1ccc(o1)`), which often contributes positively to the property (e.g., examples with aromatic rings like `c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2` have values around -0.62, but others like `Cc1ccccc1N` have +0.88).
2. **Nitro Group (`N(=O)=O`)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, nitro groups appear to reduce the property value (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has +0.87, but the nitro group is counterbalanced by other features).
3. **Amide/Carbamate-like Groups (`O=C2CN(N=C...)C(=O)N2`)**: These are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. Amides/ureas in the examples tend to reduce the property value (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has +0.64, but `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` has -0.56).
4. **Heterocyclic Structure**: The `N2` and `C(=O)N2` suggest a cyclic urea or hydantoin-like structure, which is polar and often reduces the property.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is somewhat similar to `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (property = +0.52), but with more polar groups (nitro, amides).
- It also resembles `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (property = -0.07), which has amide and aromatic features but a less polar nitro group.

### Prediction:
The nitro group and cyclic amide/urea will likely reduce the property value, but the aromaticity may offset this slightly. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This aligns with molecules like `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (property = -0.48), which also have polar heterocycles and aromatic systems.
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.9120458313247627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.51321165**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound with two phenyl rings) has a property value of **-0.16362273**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a hydrazine derivative with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms, similar to the diazo compound but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond.

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - The presence of **N-N** single bonds (as in hydrazines) tends to increase the property value compared to **N=N** double bonds (diazo compounds), as seen in other examples where more saturated nitrogen environments lead to higher values.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less conjugated than the diazo compound, which might slightly increase the property value.

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The diazo compound **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a value of **-0.16362273**.
   - The hydrazine derivative **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is expected to have a higher value due to reduced conjugation and the presence of a single bond between the nitrogens.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be slightly higher than **-0.16362273** but still in the same general range. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.10**  

This accounts for the structural similarity to the diazo compound while adjusting for the differences in nitrogen bonding.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.6887528532980371
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclic structure (a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring). The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests some polarity, but the cyclic aliphatic (non-aromatic) nature may reduce overall polarity.
2. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, which can influence its properties (e.g., dipole moment cancellation).
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a property value of **-0.6189834**. This molecule also contains cyclic amides and aliphatic chains, though it is less symmetric.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (a simple cyclic amide) has a property value of **0.65985635**, but it lacks the complexity of the target molecule.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (a cyclic diamide) has a property value of **-0.06592098**, which is closer in structure but less rigid.

### Key Observations:
- The target molecule is a **cyclic diamide with a fused cyclohexane ring**, which introduces rigidity and reduces flexibility compared to simpler amides.
- Symmetric cyclic diamides in the examples tend to have **moderately negative or near-zero values** (e.g., -0.065 for a similar diamide, -0.618 for a more complex one).
- The lack of aromaticity or highly polar substituents (like nitro or fluorine groups) suggests the property value will not be extreme (not highly positive or negative).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to cyclic diamides and the influence of symmetry/rigidity, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45**  

This balances the moderately negative trends observed in similar cyclic diamides while accounting for the molecule's unique fused-ring structure.

**Final Answer**: **-0.45** (predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2).

True Property: 0.706238118348813
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br, I) aromatic compounds** tend to have **positive property values**, often close to or above **0.9**:
   - Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene): **0.92990956**
   - Ic1ccccc1 (iodobenzene): **0.44393178**
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like): **0.92883028**

2. **Non-halogenated or less halogenated aliphatic compounds** tend to have **negative property values**:
   - CC(Cl)CCl: **-0.58887758**
   - ClCC(C)C: **-0.44593478**

3. **Aromatic systems with multiple halogens (especially Cl)** show some of the highest positive values, likely due to their electronic or steric properties.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with:
- Two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl core).
- Three chlorine substituents (two on one ring, one on the other).

This is structurally similar to the example:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property: **0.92883028**), which has even more chlorines.

Given that our target has fewer chlorines but still a heavily halogenated aromatic system, we can expect a **high positive value**, though slightly lower than the hexachlorinated example.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.89**  
*(This is slightly lower than the hexachlorinated example but still very high due to the aromaticity and multiple chlorines.)*  

### Justification:
- The biphenyl core with 3 chlorines is highly similar to the examples with high positive values.
- The property likely correlates with **electron-withdrawing effects** or **molecular rigidity** introduced by halogens on aromatic systems.
- The value is consistent with the trend observed for polychlorinated aromatics in the given data.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.8949976044565742
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Let's analyze the given molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene) and compare it to the examples to predict its property value.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with simple alkyl substituents** (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N**, **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.88484336, 0.72913062).
   - The presence of alkyl groups (like ethyl or methyl) on aromatic rings generally increases the property value.
2. **Polar or electronegative groups** (e.g., -NO2, -OH, -CO, halogens) often **decrease the property value** (e.g., **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O** has -0.74135954).
3. **Non-polar, hydrophobic alkyl/aromatic systems** without polar groups tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** has 0.72913062).

### Analysis of **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**:
- This is **diethylbenzene**, a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups attached to a benzene ring.
- It lacks polar or electronegative substituents, similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene, property = 0.72913062) and **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline, property = 0.88484336).
- The ethyl groups are less bulky than hexyl but more extended than methyl, so the property value should be **slightly lower than methylaniline but comparable to hexylbenzene**.

### Predicted property value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** would be:
**0.75** (approximately between 0.72913062 and 0.88484336). 

For specificity, I predict:  
**0.75234100** (a value close to the upper end of simple alkylaromatics but accounting for the slightly smaller substituents). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5961589500976091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **4-amino-N-sulfonylaniline**, with the following features:
1. **Aromatic ring** (benzene) with an **amino group (-NH2)** at position 1 and a **sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)NH2)** at position 4.
2. The sulfonamide group is strongly polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donor and acceptor).
3. The amino group is electron-donating, while the sulfonamide is electron-withdrawing, creating a push-pull electronic effect.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (4-nitroaniline): Property = **0.84482329**  
   - This has a nitro group (-NO2), which is strongly electron-withdrawing (similar to sulfonamide). The property is positive and relatively high.
2. **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (adenine-like): Property = **0.92379788**  
   - This is a heterocycle with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites, leading to a high positive value.
3. **Nc1ccc(cc1)I** (4-iodoaniline): Not directly in the dataset, but aniline derivatives with polar substituents tend to have positive values.
4. **Oc1ccncc1** (pyridinol): Property = **-0.55079244**  
   - This has a polar -OH group but is less polar than sulfonamide, leading to a negative value.
5. **Nc1cccc2cccnc12** (quinoline derivative): Property = **-0.8510483**  
   - This is a fused aromatic system with less polarity than sulfonamide.

### Key Observations:
- **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, SO2NH2)** on an aromatic ring tend to increase the property value if paired with an electron-donating group (e.g., NH2), as seen in 4-nitroaniline (0.844).
- **Sulfonamides** are highly polar and likely to contribute to a positive property value, similar to nitro groups but potentially slightly less extreme.
- The **push-pull effect** in 4-amino-N-sulfonylaniline should result in a high positive value, though perhaps not as high as 4-nitroaniline due to the sulfonamide being less strongly electron-withdrawing than NO2.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (0.84482329)** but with a slightly less electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group, the predicted value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** would be slightly lower but still strongly positive. 

**Prediction: 0.78**  
(Reasoning: Sulfonamide is less electron-withdrawing than nitro, so the value is slightly reduced but still high due to the strong polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.)

The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like** or **benz[a]anthracene-like** structure. It has the following features:
- Highly conjugated π-system (aromatic rings).
- No heteroatoms (only carbon and hydrogen).
- No polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2, etc.).
- Planar, rigid structure.

### Comparison with Examples:
1. **Similar PAHs in the Dataset**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**: Property = **0.83073086**  
     (A PAH with 4-5 fused rings and a methyl group; high positive value.)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**: Property = **0.86263905**  
     (A 5-ring PAH; very similar to the target molecule but larger.)
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32**: Property = **0.51242113**  
     (A smaller PAH with a methyl group; moderate positive value.)
   - **C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane)**: Property = **0.41425728**  
     (Non-aromatic, but shows that even simple cyclic structures have positive values.)

2. **Trends Observed**:
   - Aromaticity and conjugation tend to increase the property value (positive correlation).
   - Larger PAHs (more fused rings) have higher values than smaller ones.
   - Substituents like halogens or polar groups can modulate the value, but the target molecule has none.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is a **4-ring PAH** (smaller than the 5-ring example with 0.8626 but larger than the 3-ring example with 0.5124). Given the trend:
- It should have a value **between 0.5124 and 0.8626**, likely closer to the lower end because it has fewer rings than the 0.8626 example.
- No polar groups or heteroatoms to significantly alter the value.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**. For specificity, we'll round to **0.7523** (interpolating between the similar examples).

### Answer:
**0.7523** (predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34).

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.3229533253162052
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, I can predict its property value by analyzing key structural motifs and comparing them to the given dataset.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups (-OH)**: The molecule has several hydroxyl groups, which are present in molecules like **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (property = 0.9182916) and **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (property = -0.78565266). The presence of multiple -OH groups tends to increase the property value when combined with other polar or aromatic features.
2. **Aromatic Rings and Conjugation**: The molecule contains fused aromatic rings with extended conjugation, similar to **c1cc2ccc(OC)c(CC=C(C)(C))c2oc1=O** (property = 0.215277) and **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** (property = 0.86263905). Conjugated systems often contribute positively to the property.
3. **Carbonyl Group (C=O)**: The ketone group is present, as in **O=C1CNC(=O)N1** (property = 0.81219575), which tends to increase the property value when part of a polar/aromatic system.
4. **Ether Linkage (Oc)**: The ether linkage is seen in molecules like **COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23** (property = -0.70295096), but its effect depends on the rest of the structure. Here, it is part of a highly polar system.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (0.9182916): High property due to many -OH groups, but this molecule is purely aliphatic.
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-0.78565266): Low property despite two -OH groups, likely due to lack of additional polar/aromatic features.
- **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** (0.86263905): High property due to extended aromatic conjugation.
- **O=C1CNC(=O)N1** (0.81219575): High property due to polar carbonyl and nitrogen groups.

### Prediction:
The given molecule combines multiple -OH groups, aromatic conjugation, and a carbonyl group, which are all features associated with higher property values in the dataset. However, the exact value depends on the balance of these features. 

Given the similarities to **O=C1CNC(=O)N1** (0.81219575) and **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** (0.86263905), but with additional -OH groups, the property is likely in the higher range but slightly tempered by the ether linkage.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.78** (approximate, based on structural analogies and trends in the dataset). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the polar, conjugated, and aromatic nature of the molecule.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.5148846242788108
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate or thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.74054708).
   - However, when the phosphorus group is part of a more complex or bulky structure (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`), the value can be **negative** (-0.83193597).

2. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - The presence of amide groups (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tends to give **small positive values** (0.1432089) or slightly negative values if combined with other features.

3. **Thioether (S-C)**:
   - Thioether groups (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) are associated with **small negative values** (-0.0894192).

4. **Combination of features**:
   - The molecule `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` contains:
     - A phosphate group (`P(=O)`), which is often associated with positive values.
     - An amide group (`NC(C)=O`), which can contribute small positive or neutral values.
     - A thioether (`S-C`), which may slightly reduce the value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a **P=S** group and gives **0.74054708**.
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a **P=O** group but gives **-0.83193597** due to the bulky/chlorinated aromatic system.
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (simple amide) gives **0.1432089**.
- `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` (thioether) gives **-0.0894192**.

### Prediction:
The molecule `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` has:
- A **P=O** group (positive contribution).
- An **amide** (small positive or neutral).
- A **thioether** (small negative).

Given that the phosphate group is not part of a bulky/chlorinated system (unlike the negative example), its positive contribution should dominate. The amide and thioether may slightly offset this, but the overall value is likely **moderately positive**.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **~0.45**.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property and its dependence on molecular features.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.9037871299873041
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatics/Aliphatics**: 
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br) often have positive property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **0.37957867**, `c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12` has **0.87178271**).
   - Simple halogenated aliphatics like `CCBr` have high positive values (**0.88952578**).

2. **Double Bonds/C=C**: 
   - Molecules with C=C bonds tend to have higher property values if conjugated or halogenated (e.g., `CCC=O` has **0.05933249**, but this is an aldehyde; no direct C=C examples are given).

3. **Symmetry/Planarity**: 
   - Planar, symmetric molecules (e.g., `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` with two benzene rings) have high values (**0.89726933**). 
   - `Cl\C=C/Cl` is planar and symmetric, which may contribute to a higher value.

4. **Electronegativity**: 
   - Chlorine is electronegative, and its presence often increases the property value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **0.91025622**).

### Prediction for Cl\C=C/Cl:
- This is a simple, symmetric dihalogenated alkene with two electronegative chlorines attached to a C=C bond. 
- Based on the examples, halogenated aliphatics (especially with Cl or Br) tend to have property values in the **0.7–0.9 range** (e.g., `CCBr` at **0.88952578**, `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` at **0.91025622**). 
- The C=C bond adds some polarity but is not as strongly influential as aromaticity. 

Given the symmetry and halogenation, I predict a property value slightly lower than `CCBr` but still in the high positive range. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.85** (approximate, likely between 0.8 and 0.9). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.012739260533570149
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccccc1**, benzene-like) tend to have property values around **0.8-0.9** (e.g., **CNc1ccccc1 = 0.918**, **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1 = 0.879**).
   - Heteroaromatic systems (containing N, O, etc.) often have lower values than pure hydrocarbons. For example:
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 = -0.157** (polycyclic N-heteroaromatic).
     - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C = -0.285** (complex O/N-heteroaromatic).
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 = -0.432** (N-rich heterocycle).

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, halogens) can increase or decrease the property depending on context. For example:
     - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O = 0.748** (NO₂ increases value compared to phenol).
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2ccccc2 = -0.823** (halogens decrease value in this case).
   - Nitrogen in the ring (e.g., pyridine-like structures) tends to reduce the property compared to benzene.

3. **Pyridine-Like Structures**:
   - The molecule **c1ccncc1** is pyridine, a simple N-heteroaromatic. From the examples:
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 = -0.157** (more complex N-heteroaromatic, lower value).
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 = -0.432** (N-rich, even lower).
   - Pyridine is less "hydrocarbon-like" than benzene, so its value should be lower than benzene-like molecules (~0.9) but higher than highly N-substituted systems (~-0.4).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Benzene-like molecules are ~0.9.
- Pyridine has one N, reducing the property.
- No other substituents are present to further perturb the value.

A reasonable estimate for **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)** is **~0.5**. This balances the aromaticity (positive contribution) with the electronegative N (negative contribution).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: 0.55** (approximate, based on trends).

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 0.8289831467333633
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and halogenation. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`

### Key structural features:
1. **Polar/hydrophilic groups**:  
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`)  
   - An ester linkage (`-OC(=O)-`)  
   - An aromatic amine (`-Nc2ccnc3-`)  
   - A chloro substituent (`-Cl`) on the aromatic ring  

2. **Aromatic systems**:  
   - A benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`)  
   - A fused heteroaromatic system (`c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`, likely a quinoline or similar structure with a nitrogen and chlorine)  

3. **Electron-withdrawing/donating effects**:  
   - The ester (`-OC(=O)-`) is electron-withdrawing.  
   - The hydroxyl groups (`-OH`) are electron-donating.  
   - The chloro group (`-Cl`) is weakly electron-withdrawing.  
   - The amine (`-N-`) is electron-donating.  

### Comparison with examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, property = 0.711) tend to have moderately positive values.  
- Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1Cl`, property = 0.927) often have high positive values.  
- Molecules with mixed polar/nonpolar and aromatic/aliphatic features (e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2`, property = 0.156) have intermediate values.  
- Chloro-substituted aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`, property = -0.924) can have very negative values, but this depends on other substituents.  

### Predicted property:
This molecule has a mix of polar (hydroxyl, ester, amine) and aromatic (benzene, fused heterocycle) features, with an electron-withdrawing chloro group. The balance of these suggests a moderately positive property value, similar to molecules like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (0.711) or `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` (0.156), but likely closer to the middle due to the competing effects.  

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.7341575979062941
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar or hydrophilic groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO) tend to have higher (less negative) property values. 
     - Example: `CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O` (tert-butanol) has a high value of **0.90109162**.
     - `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cyclohexanol) has a value of **0.68100795**.
   - Molecules with nonpolar/hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkanes, halogens, aromatic rings without polar substituents) tend to have lower (more negative) values.
     - Example: `CCCCC(=O)CCCC` (non-polar ketone) has a very low value of **-0.91824462**.
     - `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` (bicyclic alkane) has **-0.90850029**.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains without polar groups tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
     - Example: `CCCc1ccccc1` (butylbenzene) has **0.00062373**, while `CCCCCCCI` (iodohexane) has **-0.31136695**.
   - Branching or cyclic structures can further reduce the value if nonpolar.

3. **Presence of -OH Group**:
   - Alcohols (`-OH`) generally have higher (less negative) values due to polarity/hydrogen bonding.
     - Example: `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cyclohexanol) has **0.68100795**.
     - `CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O` (tert-butanol) has **0.90109162**.

### Analysis of **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- This is a linear alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a terminal -OH group.
- Similar to `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cyclohexanol, **0.68100795**) but with a shorter linear chain.
- The -OH group will dominate the property, giving it a relatively high value, but the longer hydrophobic tail may slightly reduce it compared to smaller alcohols like tert-butanol.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **CCCCCO** to be **~0.65**. This is slightly lower than cyclohexanol due to the linear chain but still positive and relatively high due to the -OH group.

### Final Answer:
**0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.8274518064417736
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** has a value of **-0.93065419** (two aromatic rings with electron-donating -NH2 groups).
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has a value of **-0.78565266** (aromatic ring with electron-donating -OH groups).
   - **c1ccncc1** has a value of **0.01273926** (aromatic ring with a nitrogen heteroatom).

   The benzene ring here is substituted with an amide group (-C(=O)N-), which is moderately electron-withdrawing.

2. **Amide Group (-C(=O)N-)**: This is polar and can hydrogen bond, often leading to negative contributions (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has **-0.0956623**).

3. **Sulfonyl Group (-S(=O)(=O)-)**: This is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar. Examples with sulfonyl/sulfonate groups are not directly provided, but electronegative substituents like this often reduce the property value.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (CCO1)**: The five-membered ring with oxygen (O1) and sulfur (S) is polar and may contribute negatively (similar to **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2**, which has **-0.55726027**).

5. **Methyl Group (CC1=)**: Small alkyl groups like -CH3 are weakly electron-donating but have minimal impact (e.g., **CCCC** in many alkanes has positive values).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of aromatic, amide, and sulfonyl features. The sulfonyl group is likely the dominant contributor here, pulling the value toward the negative side.
- **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** (with a thiophene-like structure) has **-0.55726027**, and this molecule has additional polar groups (-S(=O)(=O)- and -C(=O)N-), which would make it more negative.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** (with multiple amides) has **-0.92761643**, but this molecule is less extreme due to the aromatic ring balancing the polarity.

### Predicted Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonyl and amide groups, combined with the aromatic ring, I predict a moderately negative value, likely between **-0.6 and -0.8**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.72** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of similar examples). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.72**
==================================================
Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.191422257362588
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: From the examples, molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have positive property values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 0.78911675).
2. **Ester groups (C(=O)OC)**: Esters are present in some examples, but their influence varies. For instance, `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has a value of 0.20416401, while `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has a strongly negative value (-0.8915382). The context matters—here, the esters are part of a more complex system.
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (NC=)**: The presence of a nitrogen in a non-aromatic ring (or double-bonded nitrogen) can influence the property. For example, `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` has a value of 0.68764522, suggesting nitrogen can contribute positively.
4. **Substituted aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings with substitutions (like nitro or ester) often have positive contributions, as seen in many examples.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The nitro-aromatic fragment (`c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`) is similar to `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (0.78911675).
- The ester groups and heterocyclic nitrogen add complexity, but the nitro group's strong positive influence likely dominates.
- The overall structure is more polar and conjugated, which may increase the property value compared to simpler nitro-aromatics.

### Predicted property value:
Given the strong positive contribution from the nitro-aromatic group and the additional polar/electron-withdrawing effects of the esters and heterocyclic nitrogen, the property value is likely **higher than 0.789** (the value for the simpler nitro-aromatic example). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.85** (rounded to two decimal places based on the trend of similar complex nitro-aromatics in the examples). 

### Exact prediction:
**0.85478187** (this matches the pattern of similarly complex nitro-aromatic structures with additional polar groups in the examples). 

Thus, the predicted property value for the given molecule is:  
**0.85478187**
==================================================
Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.3496048063284168
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests potential hydrogen bonding and polarity, which often correlates with negative property values in the given examples (e.g., amides like **CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** have a value of **-0.90744011**).

2. **Ring Strain**: 
   - The cyclopropane ring introduces significant ring strain, which can affect the molecule's electronic properties. Strained rings often destabilize the molecule, potentially leading to more negative values (e.g., **C1CCCCC1** has **-0.90460182**).

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: 
   - The molecule is symmetric with conjugated amide groups, but the strain from the cyclopropane may dominate over conjugation effects.

4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple amides (e.g., **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) tend to have strongly negative values.
   - Cyclic structures with strain (e.g., **C1CCCCC1**) also have negative values.
   - The combination of these features suggests a moderately negative value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**-0.72** (specific predicted value). 

This aligns with the trends observed for strained cyclic structures and polar amide groups in the provided examples.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.07340064297529432
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's a step-by-step analysis to predict the property for **ClCC**:

### Observations:
1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., **CCCCC**) have negative property values (e.g., -0.32799379 for **CCCCC**).
2. **Chlorinated simple alkanes** (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**) also tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.32072297 for chlorobenzene).
3. **Smaller chlorinated molecules** (e.g., **ClCC**, which is chloroethane) would likely follow this trend but may have a slightly less negative value than larger chlorinated alkanes due to reduced molecular complexity.
4. **Highly chlorinated or bulky molecules** (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) can have more negative values (e.g., -0.66343734), but **ClCC** is much simpler.

### Comparison:
- **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.32799379  
- **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.32072297  
- **ClCC** (chloroethane) is smaller and less complex than these, so its value should be less negative (closer to zero) but still negative.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **ClCC** and the trends observed, a reasonable estimate for its property value would be slightly less negative than **CCCCC** or **Clc1ccccc1**. 

**Predicted property value for ClCC: -0.25** (approximate, based on the trend).  

(Note: Without a direct example of **ClCC** or a very similar molecule, this is an educated extrapolation from the given data.)

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.01440277067495084
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring with Heteroatom (n1)**: The molecule contains a pyridine-like ring (nitrogen in the aromatic system), which is polar and can influence the property. 
   - Similar molecules with aromatic nitrogen (e.g., `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` with a value of **0.557**) tend to have positive property values, but this depends on other substituents.
2. **Chlorine Substituents**: The molecule has multiple chlorines attached to the aromatic ring and a **CCl3** group. 
   - Chlorine substituents can have varying effects:
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **0.706** (positive).
     - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2` has a value of **-0.102** (slightly negative).
     - Highly chlorinated aliphatic systems (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O`) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.642**).
   - The **CCl3** group is strongly electron-withdrawing and bulky, which may push the property toward negative values.
3. **Overall Polarity and Electronics**: The combination of an electron-deficient pyridine ring and highly chlorinated aliphatic moiety suggests moderate polarity but likely leans toward negative values due to the **CCl3** group's dominance.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **0.929**, but this is likely due to extended conjugation and symmetry.
- `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` (perchlorinated cage) has a value of **0.188**, but this is a very unique case.
- `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` (hexachlorinated nitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.525**, which is more comparable due to the high chlorine count and electron-withdrawing effects.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the **CCl3** group and the pyridine nitrogen, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely so**, similar to other highly chlorinated aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.62** (approximate, based on structural similarity to other chlorinated aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups).

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.4027253528445943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with an -OH group tend to have positive property values, especially if the -OH is on a non-aromatic carbon (aliphatic alcohol). For example:
     - `CCCC(O)CCC` (1-heptanol) has a value of **0.90703941**.
     - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (phenethyl alcohol) has a value of **0.89809857**.
     - `CC1CC2C3CC(F)C4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (a complex steroid-like molecule with multiple -OH groups) has a value of **0.88097479**.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains with -OH groups tend to have high positive values (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC` at 0.907).
   - Branching near the -OH group does not seem to significantly reduce the property value, as seen in `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (branched at the carbon adjacent to -OH) still having a high value (0.898).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCCC(C)O` (2-hexanol) is structurally similar to `CCCC(O)CCC` (1-heptanol), with the main difference being the position of the -OH group (secondary vs. primary) and slightly shorter chain length (C6 vs. C7).
   - Secondary alcohols (like 2-hexanol) might have slightly lower values than primary alcohols (like 1-heptanol) due to steric effects, but the difference is likely small.

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) or other electronegative groups often reduces the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` at -0.663). However, `CCCCC(C)O` has no such groups, so this is not a concern.

### Prediction for `CCCCC(C)O`:
Given the strong positive correlation of aliphatic -OH groups with high property values and the similarity to `CCCC(O)CCC` (0.907), I predict that `CCCCC(C)O` will have a slightly lower but still high positive value, likely in the range of **0.85 to 0.90**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.89**

### Justification:
- The secondary -OH in 2-hexanol may slightly reduce the value compared to the primary -OH in 1-heptanol (0.907), but the effect is modest.
- The shorter chain (C6 vs. C7) might also slightly reduce the value, but not significantly.
- No conflicting functional groups are present to lower the value.

Thus, **0.89** is a plausible prediction.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.4827631331761382
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Halogen Substituents**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property = **-0.82315985**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4-chlorobiphenyl with Cl on both rings): Property = **-0.82315985** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, suggesting symmetry matters)
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like): Property = **-0.22060521** (less negative, possibly due to sterics or additional Cl).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property = **0.72793934** (positive, likely due to the -OH group overriding Cl effects).

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Halogens (Cl/Br) generally introduce negative values unless other functional groups dominate (e.g., -OH or -NO2).
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, but in aromatic systems, the effect on the property may be similar unless sterics or electronic effects differ significantly.

3. **Symmetry**:
   - Symmetric dihalogenated benzenes (e.g., 1,4-disubstituted) tend to have more negative values than asymmetric or mono-substituted ones.

4. **Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane): Property = **0.13770304** (less negative than aromatic halogens).
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform): Property = **-0.47222284** (more negative than dichloromethane).
   - **CI** (iodomethane): Property = **0.92439306** (positive, likely due to iodine's polarizability).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1:
- This is **1,4-dibromobenzene**, structurally analogous to 1,4-dichlorobenzene (Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, property = **-0.82315985**).
- Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, but in this symmetric arrangement, the property value is likely similar or slightly less negative due to bromine's weaker electronegativity.
- No other functional groups are present to shift the value positively.

### Adjusting for Bromine vs. Chlorine:
- Bromine's larger size might slightly reduce the negative impact compared to chlorine, but the symmetric substitution pattern maintains a strong negative trend.
- A reasonable estimate would be **slightly less negative** than 1,4-dichlorobenzene, but still in the same range.

### Final Prediction:
**Property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.78**  
*(This is slightly less negative than 1,4-dichlorobenzene's -0.82, reflecting bromine's influence while retaining the symmetric aromatic effect.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.3795786701929788
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The property seems to be influenced by factors such as halogenation (Cl, Br), aromaticity, functional groups, and molecular complexity. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure (similar to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs). From the examples, we see that heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values (e.g., the second example in the list, **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, has a value of **0.87210328**). 

However, the molecule here is slightly less chlorinated (fewer Cl substitutions) than the second example, so the property value might be slightly lower but still positive. 

Comparing to other chlorinated aromatics and biphenyl-like structures in the dataset, a reasonable prediction for this molecule would be:  

**Predicted property value: ~0.75**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the trends in the given examples.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 0.6721477714746937
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)O...)**: A polar phosphate ester linkage.
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: Non-polar alkyl groups.
4. **Bulky structure**: The molecule is large and likely has limited flexibility due to the phosphate linker.

### Observations from the examples:
- Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CN, phosphate)** tend to have **lower (more negative) values** unless balanced by non-polar features (e.g., aromaticity or alkyl chains).
- **Aromatic systems** with **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, =O)** often have **positive values** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl` has a high value of `0.92990956`).
- **Bulky or rigid structures** with mixed polar/non-polar features (e.g., steroids, fused rings) tend to have **intermediate values** (e.g., `0.51501452` for a steroid-like molecule).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- A **phosphate group (polar, negative contribution)**.
- **Three aromatic rings (positive contribution due to delocalized electrons)**.
- **Methyl groups (non-polar, positive contribution)**.
- **Bulky structure (likely reduces polarity)**.

Given the competing effects, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. Comparing to similar examples:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (two aromatic rings with Cl substituents) has a value of `0.70623812`.
- `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (bulky, mixed polar/non-polar) has a value of `0.29059143`.

This molecule is more aromatic and less polar than the second example but less symmetric than the first. A reasonable estimate is **`0.45`**.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.8489734185075296
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Key Structural Features of the Molecule:**
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the aromatic ring (`FC(F)(F)`). From the examples, molecules with CF3 or strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F`) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., `0.9296753` for `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`).
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The ring has a CF3 and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached. Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2) often have **positive values** (e.g., `0.78911675` for `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle**: The `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` moiety contains two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Chlorine substituents can have mixed effects:
   - If the rest of the molecule is polar/electron-withdrawing (like here), the property tends to be **less negative or positive** (e.g., `0.65002068` for `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`).
   - However, heavily chlorinated aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`) are very negative (`-0.92995813`), but this is not purely aliphatic.
4. **Ketone (C=O)**: Aliphatic ketones (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`) are associated with **positive values** (`0.88819853`).

---

### **Comparison to Similar Examples:**
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of:
  - `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (CF3 + polar groups, value = `0.9296753`).
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (chlorines + aromatic, value = `0.65002068`).
  - `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (nitrogen-rich heterocycle, value = `0.92379788`).

Given the **strong electron-withdrawing CF3 group**, **chlorines in a non-aromatic context**, and **ketone**, the property value is likely **positive and moderately high**.

---

### **Predicted Property Value:**
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is:  
**`0.72`** (with uncertainty range ±0.15).  

This aligns with:
- CF3 contribution (~+0.8 to +0.9).
- Chlorines in a heterocycle (~neutral to slightly positive).
- Ketone (~+0.5 to +0.9).

---

**Predicted property value: `0.72`**

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2813362621669994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Present in examples like `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 0.21402858) and `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` (property = 0.19142226). These tend to contribute moderately positive values.
   - **Nitro group (-NO2, represented as N(=O)=O)**: Present in examples like `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.24582639) and `c2ccccc2N(=O)=O` (in the last example, property = 0.19142226). Nitro groups often contribute positively but can vary based on context.
   - **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, with properties ranging widely depending on substituents. For example, `Cc1cccc(C)c1` has a high value (0.91391548), while `c1ccccc1O` has a low value (-0.92782874).

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.24582639): This is a dinitrobenzene, and the nitro groups dominate the property.
   - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 0.21402858): This is dimethyl phthalate, where ester groups contribute moderately.
   - `COc1ccccc1O` (not in the list, but analogous): If this were present, it might have a lower value due to the polar hydroxyl group, but the nitro group here is more electron-withdrawing.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing vs. Electron-Donating Effects**:
   - The methoxy group is electron-donating (+M effect), while the nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing (-M effect). This push-pull effect on the aromatic ring may balance out to a moderate property value.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both a moderately donating methoxy group and a strongly withdrawing nitro group, the property value is likely to be in the low-to-moderate positive range, similar to other nitroaromatics in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.20** (approximate, likely between 0.15 and 0.25 based on similar molecules). 

For specificity, let's round to:  
**0.215** (close to `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` at 0.245 and `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` at 0.214). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 0.215**

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.12947354091034158
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, halogenation (especially chlorine and bromine), and structural complexity (e.g., ring systems, branching, and functional groups). 

The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a complex polycyclic structure:
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

### Observations:
1. **High Chlorination**: Many chlorine atoms are present, which often increases the property value (e.g., `ClCCCl` has 0.829, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` has -0.431). However, the latter case shows that extreme chlorination can lower the value, possibly due to steric or symmetry effects.
2. **Polycyclic Structure**: Molecules with fused rings (e.g., `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has 0.871, `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` has 0.837) tend to have higher property values, especially if aromatic. This molecule is aliphatic but highly strained due to multiple fused rings.
3. **Steric Hindrance**: The dense chlorination and cage-like structure may introduce steric clashes, potentially lowering the property value (similar to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `ClCCCl` (0.829): Simple dichlorinated, linear.
- `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (-0.431): Highly chlorinated but symmetric and less strained.
- `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (0.871): Aromatic polycyclic with halogenation.

This molecule is more like a hybrid of the highly chlorinated aliphatic and polycyclic cases. The strain and lack of aromaticity may reduce the property value compared to aromatic polycyclics, but the high chlorine count could offset this.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects (high chlorine count increasing the value, but steric strain and lack of aromaticity decreasing it), the property value is likely **moderate to high**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.712**  

This balances the positive influence of chlorination with the negative impact of steric strain in the polycyclic system.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.6435249911067775
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features such as functional groups, polarity, and structural complexity. 

The molecule in question is **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate, an ester). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Esters and similar carbonyl-containing compounds**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: Property = -0.57480409
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: Property = 0.79207978
   - Esters with aromatic rings or additional polar groups tend to have higher (less negative) values, while simpler esters or those with electron-withdrawing groups may have lower (more negative) values.

2. **Simple aliphatic esters**:
   - **CCCOC=O** is a simple aliphatic ester (no aromaticity or additional functional groups). 
   - Similar simple molecules like **CC#N** (-0.87921857) or **CCCI** (-0.87898721) have strongly negative values, while polar but less saturated molecules like **CCC#C** (0.84531391) have positive values.

3. **Polarity and saturation**:
   - The ester group is polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro or halogen groups (which often lead to positive values, e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** = 0.24582639).
   - The lack of aromaticity or extended conjugation suggests a moderately negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **CCCOC=O** (no aromaticity, no additional functional groups), its property value is likely moderately negative, similar to other simple polar aliphatic compounds. 

Comparing to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.57480409), which has an additional aromatic ring and amine group, **CCCOC=O** would likely be slightly more negative due to reduced complexity and polarity.

### Final predicted value:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.7955890124872284
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity vs. Hydrophilicity**:
   - Long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = 0.729) tend to have higher (more positive) property values, likely reflecting hydrophobicity.
   - Polar or electronegative groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**, property = -0.785) tend to lower the property value, likely reflecting hydrophilicity or polarity.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**, property = -0.930) often have negative values, especially if combined with aromatic rings or other polar groups.
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CC**, property = -0.886) have very negative values, but longer chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = 0.729) can invert this trend due to increased hydrophobicity.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings alone (e.g., **c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2c(O)cccc2**, property = -0.699) tend to lower the property, but when combined with long aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = 0.729), the property increases.

4. **Halogens and Electronegative Atoms**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) often lower the property (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br**, property = -0.227), but this depends on context.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) suggests a significant hydrophobic contribution, which would increase the property value (as seen in **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = 0.729).
- The ester group is polar and would somewhat counteract the hydrophobicity, but its impact is likely smaller than the long chain's dominance.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (7-carbon chain + benzene, property = 0.729) is very hydrophobic.
  - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (complex steroid with polar groups, property = -0.847) is more polar.
  - **CCCOC** (short ether, property = 0.679) has a positive value despite the polar group.

Given the dominance of the long hydrophobic chain, the ester's polar effect is likely outweighed, but not entirely negated. Thus, the property value should be **positive but not as high as a pure hydrocarbon**.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.65**, similar to **CCCOC (0.679)** but slightly lower due to the ester's polarity. 

**Final Prediction: 0.65** (specific value could range between 0.6 and 0.7 based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on hydrophobicity trends.)

True Property: -0.56551119146764
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like moiety (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (property = -0.842) and **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.755). The presence of Cl substituents tends to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted phenol.

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Seen in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.066). Amides often reduce hydrophobicity (lower property values), but context matters.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.733) and **NNc1ccccc1** (property = 0.625). Nitro groups tend to increase the property value when attached to aromatic rings.

4. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: 
   - Chlorines are present in many examples, e.g., **Cl\C=C/Cl** (property = 0.904) and **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.733). They generally increase the property value, especially when multiple are present.

5. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - The molecule has two aromatic rings, similar to **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.104). Extended conjugation can slightly increase the property.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property of 0.755. Adding an amide and nitro group (as in this molecule) introduces polar groups but also adds aromatic bulk. The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing effect may dominate, increasing the property further.
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a property of 0.733, and this molecule has more aromatic bulk and an additional Cl, which could push the value higher.
- The amide linker may slightly reduce the property, but the nitro group and additional Cl likely compensate.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value is likely **higher than 0.733** but less than the most extreme values (e.g., 0.904 for **Cl\C=C/Cl**). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.78** (specific to this molecule's balance of polar nitro/amide groups and aromatic/Cl contributions). 

This aligns with the trend where nitro-aromatics with Cl substituents have high property values (e.g., 0.733, 0.872), and the additional phenol/amide groups don't fully counteract this effect.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.5650161110661297
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule:

**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)** are present in some molecules, and their property values vary but are often in the mid-range (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of `-0.6995124`).
2. **Aromatic rings with sulfur (S) linkages** (e.g., thioether or thiophene-like structures) tend to have higher property values (e.g., `CCSSCC` has `0.92893503`, and `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` has `0.55708249`).
3. **Chlorinated aromatic rings** often lower the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` has `-0.36375285`), but this molecule does not have chlorinated rings.
4. **Symmetry and multiple functional groups** can influence the property. This molecule has two phosphorothioate groups and a central sulfur-linked aromatic system, which may increase the property value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- The molecule has:
  - Two **phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**, which are polar and bulky.
  - A **thioether linkage (S)** between two aromatic rings, which is electron-rich and may contribute to higher values.
  - No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or chloro), which would lower the value.
  - The structure is symmetric and has extended conjugation, which may increase the property value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `CCSSCC` (a simple disulfide) has a very high value (`0.92893503`), suggesting sulfur linkages increase the property.
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of `-0.6995124`, but this includes a chloroaromatic group (which lowers the value) and an amide.
- The target molecule lacks chloro groups and has more sulfur-aromatic character, so its value should be higher than `-0.6995124` but not as extreme as `0.92893503`.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the sulfur linkages and phosphorothioate groups, the value is likely **positive and moderate**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- The presence of sulfur linkages (increasing the value).
- The phosphorothioate groups (moderate contribution).
- The lack of strongly electron-withdrawing groups (no large negative effect). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7481692939066741
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tend to have **positive property values** (often > 0.7). Examples:
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` → **0.78911675**
     - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` → **0.87367802**
     - `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (nitro-like electron-withdrawing effect) → **0.91025622**

2. **Hydroxy Group (OH) on Aromatic Ring**:
   - When an OH group is attached to an aromatic ring, it often increases the property value, especially if combined with other electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro). Example:
     - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` → **0.92658847** (note: also has amide, but OH contributes).

3. **Combination of OH and NO2 on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both an OH and a NO2 group on the same aromatic ring. This is structurally similar to:
     - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (property = **0.92658847**), but with NO2 instead of amide.
     - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (property = **0.87367802**), where the NO2 is on a separate ring but still contributes strongly.

4. **No Competing Negative Features**:
   - The molecule lacks large hydrophobic/aliphatic chains or other groups that would reduce the property value (e.g., long alkyl chains typically correlate with negative values).

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contribution of the NO2 group and the additional boost from the OH group, the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** should be **highly positive**, likely in the range of **0.85 to 0.95**. 

Comparing with similar structures:
- The closest analog is `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (**0.92658847**), where the NO2 is slightly more electron-withdrawing than the amide, but the OH is the same. Thus, the value should be similar or slightly higher.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.92658847** (same as `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`, as the NO2 and OH combination is expected to have a similar effect to the amide and OH combination). 

However, since NO2 is more strongly electron-withdrawing than the amide, the value might be slightly higher. But given the examples, we'll stick to the **0.92 range**.

### Answer:
**0.92658847**

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.9270765389447624
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is a large, highly oxygenated carbohydrate (a sugar derivative) with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (-O-). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many hydroxyl groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.74286651), likely due to high polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- Large, complex molecules with oxygenated functional groups (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`) can have positive or negative values depending on exact structure, but sugars tend to be negative.
- The presence of multiple -OH groups and ether linkages in this molecule suggests strong polarity and hydrogen bonding, similar to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but more pronounced due to size.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for:
`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`

would likely be **more negative** than simpler polyols, reflecting its high polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.85** (approximate, based on trend). 

This aligns with the trend where highly oxygenated, polar molecules (especially sugars) have negative values in the given dataset.

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.8453139060332359
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes and Nitriles (C≡C or C≡N):**
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a dinitrile) has a high positive value (**0.91081821**).
   - The presence of triple bonds (C≡C or C≡N) seems to correlate with higher property values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature or polarizability.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains:**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long aliphatic chain with a terminal OH) has a near-zero value (**-0.00328313**).
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (similar but longer) has a positive value (**0.72669859**), suggesting chain length may weakly increase the property.
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone) has a negative value (**-0.45574449**), indicating carbonyls may decrease the property.

3. **Simple Alkenes/Alkynes:**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (a simple alkene) has a slightly negative value (**-0.12039444**).
   - Triple bonds (as in the dinitrile example) seem to increase the property more than double bonds.

4. **Polar vs. Nonpolar Groups:**
   - Polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O, Cl) tend to reduce the property unless they are part of a strongly electron-withdrawing system (like nitriles).
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons have values closer to zero unless functionalized.

### Analysis of CCC#C (1-butyne):
- This is a simple alkyne with a terminal C≡C bond and a short aliphatic chain (propyl group attached to the alkyne).
- Compared to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (which has two nitriles and an aromatic ring), **CCC#C** is simpler but shares the triple bond feature.
- The absence of aromaticity or additional polar groups suggests the property value will be lower than the dinitrile example but still positive due to the triple bond.
- The short chain length (3 carbons) may limit the magnitude of the property.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for **CCC#C** to be **moderately positive**, similar to other molecules with triple bonds but less than highly conjugated or polyfunctional examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.45** (specific value: **0.45000000**)  

This aligns with the trend that triple bonds increase the property, while the lack of additional functional groups keeps it from reaching higher values like those seen in nitriles or long-chain alcohols.

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.7265891412178922
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, molecules with P(=S) or similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have property values around **-0.6995** and **-0.8915**, suggesting a negative contribution.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions (c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: Chlorinated aromatic rings appear in several examples:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: **0.3796**
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**: **-0.3638**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: **0.7062**
   The property value seems to depend on the number and pattern of chlorine substitutions. Here, the trichloro-substituted ring may push the value toward the positive side (as in the last example).
3. **Ethoxy and ethyl groups (CCOP(=S)(CC))**: These are moderately hydrophobic and neutral contributors. Similar aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O**) have values close to zero (**-0.0004**), but the P(=S) group likely dominates.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = **-0.6995** (has P(=S), Cl-substituted aromatic, and polar groups).
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.7062** (dichloro-substituted aromatics with no P(=S)).
- The presence of P(=S) and multiple Cl substitutions suggests a balance between negative (P(=S)) and positive (Cl-substituted aromatic) contributions.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of P(=S) (negative contribution) and a heavily chlorinated aromatic ring (positive contribution), the property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is between **0.2 and 0.6**, leaning toward the higher end due to the three chlorine atoms.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.45** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.9121600780257229
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis of `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring (`c1nccc...c1`) with a substituent at one of the carbons.
2. **Substituent**: The substituent is `C(=O)NN`, which is a hydrazide group (`-CONHNH2`). This group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as a donor and acceptor).
3. **Aromaticity**: The pyridine ring is aromatic, contributing to some degree of hydrophobicity but also polarizability due to the nitrogen in the ring.
4. **Electron-Withdrawing/Directing Effects**: The pyridine nitrogen is electron-withdrawing, and the hydrazide group is also electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl (C=O).

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Polar Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`) tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., 0.91, -0.78). The hydrazide group here is similarly polar.
- **Aromatic + Polar Substituents**: Examples like `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = -0.059) and `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = 0.158) show that aromatic systems with polar substituents can have values around 0 to 0.2.
- **Hydrogen Bonding**: The hydrazide group can form strong hydrogen bonds, which may lower the property value (as seen with other H-bonding groups like amides).
- **Pyridine vs. Benzene**: Pyridine is more polar than benzene, which might slightly lower the property value compared to purely benzene-based systems.

### Closest Analogues:
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = -0.059): Similar aromatic system with a polar amino group.
- `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = 0.158): Diphenylamine, less polar than our hydrazide-substituted pyridine.
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.845): Highly polar nitro and amino groups, but our hydrazide is less polar than a nitro group.

### Prediction:
Given the polar hydrazide group and the pyridine ring, the property value is likely in the low to mid-positive range. The presence of the pyridine nitrogen (electron-withdrawing) and the hydrazide (polar, H-bonding) suggests a value slightly lower than simpler aromatic amines but higher than highly polar nitro compounds. 

A reasonable estimate would be around **0.25**. 

However, looking at the trend for similar polar aromatic systems, a more precise guess might be closer to **0.15**. 

Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**Predicted property value: 0.12** (slightly lower than diphenylamine due to the pyridine and hydrazide). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.8190701257380653
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule. In the examples, molecules with P(=S) or similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have property values around **0.671**. This suggests that the P(=S) group may contribute positively to the property.
2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Present in the molecule. Examples with amide groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) have values around **0.149**, indicating a moderate positive contribution.
3. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: These are neutral or slightly negative contributors, as seen in molecules like **CCCCCOC(=O)CC** (-0.121) or **CCCCCCCI** (-0.311).
4. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: Neutral to slightly positive, similar to **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (0.919) or **CC1=CCCCC1** (-0.048), depending on substitutions.
5. **Thioether (SCC)**: Less common in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups like **CCS** (0.896) or **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (0.022) suggest variability.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is most similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (0.671), but with additional alkyl/amide groups.
- The amide and alkyl chains may slightly reduce the value compared to the phosphorothioate-dominated case.

### Predicted Value:
Given the dominance of the **P(=S)** group (strong positive contribution) and the balancing effects of the amide/alkyl chains, a reasonable estimate is slightly lower than **0.671** but still positive. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.45** (plausible range: 0.4 to 0.6). 

### Exact Prediction:
Based on the examples and the structure, the predicted value is:  
**0.452**.  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given data; actual values may vary slightly depending on finer structural nuances.)

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.47816034013226094
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups, no halogens, and no aromaticity. From the examples, similar simple alkanes or non-polar molecules tend to have property values in the range of **~0.9 to ~0.7** (e.g., C/C1CCCCC1\C: 0.91908824, CCCCCCCO: 0.90877021). However, slightly shorter alkanes or less polar molecules may have lower values (e.g., CCC(O)CC: -0.72923843, but this has an -OH group). 

Since octane is entirely non-polar and lacks any functional groups, its property value should be relatively high, similar to other non-polar hydrocarbons in the dataset. 

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: ~0.91**  

*(This is an estimate based on the trend observed for similar non-polar hydrocarbons in the provided examples.)*

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.5427772215447213
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's break down its structural features and compare them to the examples to predict the property value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** with property **0.61551306** and **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** with property **0.84347959**). These structures typically have property values in the **0.6–0.9 range** when functionalized with polar groups (e.g., OH, C=O).
2. **Ketone (=O) and hydroxyl (OH) groups**: These polar groups increase the property value (as seen in other examples with similar groups).
3. **Alkyne (C#C) group**: This is a less common feature, but its presence doesn't seem to drastically lower the property in similar contexts (e.g., **CC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** has a property of **0.0824835**, but this is a very different scaffold).
4. **Overall polarity**: The combination of C=O and OH groups suggests moderate to high polarity, correlating with higher property values in the examples.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property **0.61551306**): Similar steroid-like structure with ketone and OH, but fewer polar groups.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property **0.84347959**): More polar groups (two OH, one C=O, one F), leading to a higher value.
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property **-0.90223114**): This is an outlier; likely an error in the data or a very different property context (note the negative value despite having C=O and OH).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values **~0.6–0.8**, and the presence of **two OH groups and one C=O**, the predicted property value should be in the higher end of this range. The alkyne may slightly reduce the value compared to purely hydroxylated/ketone steroids.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.78**  
*(Rationale: Closest to the steroid-like examples with multiple polar groups, but slightly adjusted for the alkyne.)*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.3215228489464428
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, oxygen-containing groups), molecular size, and functional group composition. The property values range from negative (e.g., highly halogenated or polar molecules) to positive (e.g., aromatic or less polar molecules).

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

### Key observations:
1. **Structural features**:
   - Multiple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene and fused polycyclic systems).
   - Oxygen-containing substituents (methoxy `OCH3`, hydroxyl `OH`, carbonyl `C=O`, and ether `O` linkages).
   - A complex, bulky structure with fused rings and sugar-like moieties (e.g., tetrahydrofuran or pyran rings).
   - No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `NO2`, `SO2`).

2. **Comparison to examples**:
   - Molecules with oxygenated aromatic systems (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `COc1ccccc1Cl`) have positive property values (~0.27 to ~0.75).
   - Bulky polycyclic aromatics (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`) have high positive values (~0.86).
   - The presence of multiple oxygen atoms (ethers, hydroxyls) tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but keeps it positive unless strongly polar (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` has ~0.79).

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule is large and aromatic but heavily oxygenated, which will reduce the property value compared to non-oxygenated polycyclics.
   - No strongly negative contributors (e.g., halogens, sulfonamides) are present.
   - The closest analogs in the examples are oxygenated aromatics or polycyclics with values in the **0.5–0.8 range**.

### Final prediction:
Given the balance of aromaticity (positive contribution) and oxygenated polar groups (negative but not extreme), the predicted property value is:  
**~0.65** (likely between 0.6 and 0.7).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the provided data.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.2706819058122159
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a property value of **0.74816929**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above, repeated in the list) also has **0.74816929**.
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly listed, but fragments suggest hydroxyl + benzene) tends to have positive values when combined with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has **-0.92402201**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has **-0.82315985**.
   - Chlorine on benzene tends to reduce the property value (negative trend), but the effect is less pronounced when combined with other substituents.

3. **Combined Substituents**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has both an electron-donating hydroxyl (-OH) and an electron-withdrawing chlorine (-Cl). The hydroxyl group likely dominates, pulling the value toward the positive range, but the chlorine attenuates this effect compared to nitrophenol.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) has **-0.6848705**, but fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, so chlorine may have a less negative impact.
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol) has **-0.55689824**, suggesting that strong electron-withdrawing groups (I, CN) with -OH still result in negative values, but less so than halogens alone.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol with NO₂ is strongly positive (**0.748**).
- Chlorobenzene derivatives are negative (e.g., **-0.924** for chloroiodobenzene).
- The hydroxyl group in **Oc1ccccc1Cl** will push the value up, but the chlorine will pull it down.

A reasonable estimate is **between 0 and 0.5**, closer to the nitrophenol value but less positive due to chlorine. From the examples, the closest analog is **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (**-0.556**), but with only one chlorine and no other strong electron-withdrawing groups, the value should be higher.

### Final Prediction:
**0.25** (approximate, based on interpolation of trends). 

However, looking more carefully, **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is **0.748**, and replacing NO₂ with Cl (less electron-withdrawing) might reduce the value by ~0.5, giving **~0.25**. Alternatively, if we average the nitrophenol (**0.748**) and chlorobenzene-like (**-0.9**) extremes, we get **~-0.1**, but this seems too low. 

Given the ambiguity, a more precise estimate is **0.15** (slightly positive due to -OH dominating over -Cl). 

But reviewing **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene) with **0.156**, which is somewhat similar, I’d predict:

**Predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl: 0.15** (likely between 0.1 and 0.3). 

For specificity, I’ll round to **0.18**. 

However, considering the nitrophenol (0.748) and chlorobenzene (-0.924) examples, a weighted average (giving more weight to -OH) suggests **~0.2**. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.20** (approximate). 

Given the data, the most plausible answer is:  
**0.20** (with uncertainty ±0.1). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I’ll provide:  
**0.18**. 

After reconsidering, the closest direct analog is **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.748)**, and replacing NO₂ with Cl (less electron-withdrawing) would reduce the value. If we assume Cl contributes ~-0.5 relative to NO₂, then:  
0.748 - 0.5 = **0.248**. 

Rounding to match the examples: **0.25**. 

### Final Answer:  
**0.25** (predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl).

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.08248350260735782
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present at the terminal alkyne (ClCC#C-) and on the aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1). Chlorine is electronegative and can influence polarity and interactions.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: A triple bond, which is relatively nonpolar but contributes to rigidity.
   - **Ester (OC(=O)N)**: A polar group that can form hydrogen bonds and increase solubility.
   - **Aromatic Ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: A substituted benzene ring with chlorine, contributing to hydrophobicity and potential dipole moments.
   - **Ether (O)**: Links the alkyne to the ester, adding some polarity.

2. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - Molecules with **chlorine substituents** and **polar groups** (e.g., esters, amides) often have property values in the **middle range (0.1 to 0.8)** unless heavily halogenated or sterically hindered.
   - For example:
     - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (0.84897342): Multiple halogens and polar groups.
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (0.65002068): Highly chlorinated, high value.
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (0.21402858): Diester, moderate value.
     - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (0.76878089): Polar groups and aromatic rings.
   - The presence of **two chlorines** and an **ester-amide group** suggests a moderate polarity, but the alkyne may reduce it slightly.

3. **Estimated Property Value**:
   - The molecule is less polar than highly halogenated examples but more polar than simple hydrocarbons or single-substituted aromatics.
   - The alkyne and ether linker may slightly lower the value compared to similar molecules with more polar groups.
   - Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is **~0.45**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is **0.45**.
==================================================
Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.6266688897652926
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains an **alcohol group (OH)**, which is polar and often associated with negative property values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` has -0.78565266).
   - It also has **two aromatic chlorine substituents (Cl)**, which can contribute positively or negatively depending on context (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has 0.92990956, but `ClC=C(Cl)Cl` has -0.47236203).

2. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - The molecule has **three aromatic rings**: two benzene rings (one with Cl substituents) and one pyrimidine-like ring (`c2cncnc2`). Aromaticity alone doesn't strongly correlate with the property, but substitution patterns matter.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalizing Effects**: 
   - The **OH group** is electron-donating, while **Cl** is weakly electron-withdrawing. The **pyrimidine-like ring (`cncnc`)** is electron-deficient and polar, likely contributing negatively.

4. **Bulky/Extended Conjugation**: 
   - The molecule is large with extended conjugation, but this doesn't always correlate strongly with the property in the examples (e.g., large molecules like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` have -0.88306761, while others like `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCC3CCC2C3` have 0.8861724).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Negative Contributors**: 
  - OH groups (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`: -0.78565266). 
  - Pyrimidine-like N-heterocycles (e.g., `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`: 0.91926582, but this is an outlier; most N-heterocycles with polar groups trend negative).
- **Positive Contributors**: 
  - Aromatic Cl substituents (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`: 0.92990956). 
  - However, the combination of OH + Cl + N-heterocycle likely dominates negatively.

### Prediction:
Given the **OH group**, **polar N-heterocycle**, and **Cl substituents**, the molecule likely has a **moderately negative property value**, similar to other polar/heterocyclic examples. 

Examples like `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (-0.78565266) and `CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C` (-0.39383151) suggest a range of -0.4 to -0.8. The presence of two Cl atoms might pull it slightly less negative than pure OH/N-heterocycle cases.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.55**  
*(Estimated range: -0.4 to -0.7 based on structural analogs)*.
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7982057693134151
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Saturation**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to have higher (more positive) property values (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` has 0.909, `CCCCBr` has -0.920).
   - Unsaturation (e.g., `C=Cc1ccccc1` has 0.929) often increases the property value compared to saturated analogs.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**:
     - Aldehydes (`CCCCCC=O` has -0.691) tend to lower the property value.
     - Esters (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC` has -0.290, `CC(=O)OC3...` has -0.452) generally have moderate negative values.
     - Ketones (`CCCCCCCCC(=O)C` has 0.054) can vary but are often near zero.
   - **Nitro groups (NO2)**: Strongly negative (e.g., `CN(=O)=O` has -0.889).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**: Tend to lower the property value (e.g., `CC(C)I` has -0.882, `BrC(Br)Br` has -0.596).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Often increase the property value unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Cc1ccncc1C` has 0.467).

3. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
   - Ethers (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` has 0.724) can increase the property value unless combined with other negative contributors.
   - Alcohols are not directly represented here, but esters (which contain C=O and O) tend to be negative.

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is an ester (butyl formate: `HCOO(CH2)3CH3`).
- Esters in the examples:
  - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): -0.290
  - `CC(=O)OC3...` (complex ester): -0.452
- The formate group (`HC=O`) is simpler than acetate (`CH3C=O`), which might slightly increase the property value compared to ethyl acetate.
- The butyl chain is longer than ethyl, which could push the value slightly higher (longer chains tend to increase the property).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **CCCCOC=O** is likely to have a property value **between -0.25 and -0.15**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.20**  

This is based on:
- Similarity to ethyl acetate (-0.290) but with a longer chain (pushing the value up slightly).
- No strongly negative groups (like NO2 or halogens) to pull it lower. 

Let me know if you'd like further refinement!

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.13770303711738052
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the provided data.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Compounds**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.82943342**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.85051776**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.91025622**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a property value of **0.91025622**.
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)...** (a highly chlorinated compound) has a property value of **0.15293709**, but this is an outlier due to other functional groups.

   Chlorinated compounds generally have **high positive property values** (often > 0.8), unless other functional groups significantly alter the trend.

2. **Small Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.82943342**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is structurally similar but smaller. Smaller chlorinated alkanes tend to have slightly lower values than larger ones (e.g., compare **CCBr** = 0.88952578 vs. **CCCCCCCCBr** = -0.46738248, but this is for brominated compounds).

3. **Other Trends**:
   - The presence of **oxygen or nitrogen** can either increase or decrease the property value depending on the context (e.g., **CNN** = -0.84729261, but **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = 0.91025622).
   - Simple hydrocarbons like **CCCC** have high values (0.921578), but this is likely an exception due to the simplicity of the molecule.

### Prediction for **ClCCl**:
- **ClCCl** is a small chlorinated alkane, similar to **ClCCCl** but with one fewer carbon. Given that **ClCCCl** has a value of **0.82943342**, we expect **ClCCl** to have a slightly lower value due to its smaller size and reduced molecular complexity.
- However, chlorinated compounds consistently show high positive values unless other functional groups are present. 

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is **~0.80**. 

For specificity, we can interpolate between **ClCCCl (0.829)** and smaller chlorinated fragments (e.g., **CCBr = 0.889**, but this is brominated). Since **ClCCl** is simpler than **ClCCCl**, we adjust slightly downward:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.81** (rounded from a likely range of 0.80-0.82). 

This aligns with the high values seen for other small chlorinated molecules in the dataset.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.8335984474881905
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH groups tend to have negative property values, especially if they are aromatic (e.g., phenol derivatives).
     - Example: `Oc1cccc(O)c1` → **-0.78565266**
     - Example: `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` → **-0.53949084**
     - Example: `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` → **-0.35678308**

2. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with simple alkyl groups (like methyl, ethyl) often have moderately negative values unless other strongly polar or electronegative groups are present.
     - Example: `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` → **-0.53949084**
     - Example: `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` → **0.51242113** (no -OH, so less negative).

3. **Combination of -OH and Alkyl Groups**:
   - When -OH is attached to an aromatic ring with alkyl substituents (e.g., methyl), the property tends to be negative but less so than with multiple -OH groups or additional electronegative atoms.
     - Example: `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` → **-0.53949084** (similar to our target molecule but with an extra methyl).

### Target Molecule: **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**
- This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,5-dimethylphenol). 
- It has:
  - An aromatic ring.
  - One hydroxyl group (-OH).
  - Two methyl groups (one at position 1 and one at position 4 relative to the -OH).

### Prediction:
Given the examples:
- Phenol derivatives with -OH and alkyl groups tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.539 for `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`).
- The presence of two methyl groups (electron-donating) may slightly increase the property value compared to phenol itself (less negative), but the -OH dominates the trend toward negative values.

Given the similarity to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (which has two methyl groups and one -OH and a value of -0.539), our molecule is very similar but with slightly less steric hindrance (methyls at 2,5 instead of 3,5). Thus, the property value should be in a similar range but perhaps slightly less negative.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: -0.45**  
(Approximate range: -0.4 to -0.6 based on similar examples.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.30310089296996795
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **-0.92995813**).
   - However, some exceptions exist (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **0.37957867**), likely due to symmetry or substitution patterns.

2. **Target Molecule Structure**:
   - The target is a **biphenyl derivative with 5 chlorine atoms**, resembling a mix of the two examples above. 
   - The substitution pattern is less symmetric than the positive outlier but more symmetric than the highly negative example.

3. **Trends**:
   - Bulky, highly halogenated aromatics often show negative values unless symmetry or electronic effects counteract this.
   - The target lacks strong electron-withdrawing groups (like NO₂) or symmetry, leaning toward a **moderately negative value**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (-0.929) but with slightly fewer chlorines and a biphenyl core, the predicted value is **less negative** but still in the negative range.  

**Final Prediction: -0.45**  
*(Rationale: Intermediate between the highly negative -0.93 and the positive outlier 0.38, accounting for substitution density and symmetry.)*

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.29596385604295766
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the structure of the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (which is 2-methyl-2-butene), I can make the following observations:

1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trend**: The molecule is a simple alkene with a branched structure. From the examples, purely hydrocarbon structures (e.g., alkanes, alkenes) tend to have negative or near-zero property values when they are larger or more branched. For instance:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a value of **-0.12039444**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a value of **-0.86759774**.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is smaller and less branched than these, so its value should be less negative but still likely negative.

2. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: The molecule lacks polar functional groups (like -OH, -C=O, -NO2, etc.), which in the examples often correlate with positive property values. Non-polar hydrocarbons tend to have negative values.

3. **Steric Effects**: The branching (geminal dimethyl substitution) might slightly increase the property value compared to linear alkenes, but not enough to make it positive.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane) has a value of **0.47816034**, but this is likely an outlier or the property isn't strictly logP. Most other alkanes/alkenes are negative.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is smaller than octane but has a double bond, which might slightly reduce the property value.

Given these trends, I predict the property value for **CC=C(C)C** to be **negative but close to zero**, similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C** but slightly more negative due to branching.

### Predicted Property Value: **-0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something else, the reasoning may differ.)

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.13770303711738052
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) by analyzing trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.858). 
   - However, simpler chlorinated molecules like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) have a moderately negative value (-0.632), and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has a positive value (0.271).

2. **Small/Aliphatic Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene): -0.632
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex chlorinated hydrocarbon): 0.129
   - `ClC4=C(Cl)C5(Cl)C3C1CC(C2OC12)C3C4(Cl)C5(Cl)Cl` (another complex chlorinated hydrocarbon): -0.890

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a very simple molecule with two chlorines and no other functional groups or complexity. 
   - Compared to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (-0.632), dichloromethane is less chlorinated and less bulky, so its value might be less negative.
   - Compared to `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (0.271), dichloromethane lacks an aromatic ring, which seems to correlate with higher values in the data.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of dichloromethane and the trends observed:
- It likely has a **moderately negative property value**, but not as extreme as heavily chlorinated or bulky molecules.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.4 and -0.6**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.55** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

This is an educated guess given the limited examples, and the actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.806693043308517
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given examples:
1. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **negative property values**, especially when multiple chlorines are present. For example:
   - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a property value of **-0.80669304** (very similar to the query molecule, just with a slightly different substitution pattern).
   - `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` (brominated analog) has a value of **0.35866711**, but halogens like bromine may behave differently from chlorine.
   - `ClCC` (simple chloroalkane) has a value of **0.07340064**, but aromatic chlorination seems to have a stronger negative effect.

2. **Phenol derivatives (OH attached to benzene)** with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) often have **lower (more negative) property values**:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1` has a value of **-0.6454202**.
   - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (as above) is **-0.80669304**.

3. The **number and position of chlorines** matter:
   - More chlorines (especially in positions ortho/para to the OH group) seem to decrease the property value further.

### Analysis of the query molecule:
The query molecule is **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which is a trichlorophenol (2,4,6-trichlorophenol, based on the SMILES notation). 

- It has **three chlorines**, two of which are ortho to the OH group and one para.
- This is very similar to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (given example, likely 2,4,5-trichlorophenol), which has a value of **-0.80669304**.
- The query molecule has a slightly more symmetric substitution (2,4,6-), which might not drastically change the property.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.80669304), the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should be **close to -0.80**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: -0.81**  
(slightly more negative due to the symmetric substitution enhancing electron withdrawal).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.3215228489464428
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, predicting the exact property value requires careful consideration of structural features and their contributions to the property in question. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### **Key Structural Features of the Molecule:**
1. **Multiple Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups:**
   - Ethers (`OC`, `OCO`), hydroxyl groups (`OH`), and a ketone (`C=O`).
   - These polar groups typically **increase** the property value (as seen in examples like `OCC(O)CO` → **0.92999881** and `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` → **0.92932164**).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Oxygen Substituents:**
   - The presence of methoxy (`OCH₃`) and hydroxyl (`OH`) groups on aromatic rings (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`) suggests **higher property values** (similar to `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **0.74816929**).

3. **Fused Ring Systems:**
   - The molecule contains a complex fused ring system with multiple oxygen substitutions, which may contribute to **moderate-to-high values** (e.g., `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` → **0.54879643**).

4. **Lack of Strongly Negative Contributors:**
   - No long aliphatic chains (like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` → **-0.31373684**).
   - No highly hydrophobic or halogen-heavy regions (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` → **-0.63161675**).

### **Comparison with Similar Examples:**
- The molecule resembles **oxygen-rich carbohydrates** (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` → **0.92932164**) and **aromatic polyethers** (e.g., `OCOc1ccc(OS(C)(=O)=O)cc1C2(C)C` → **0.59629399**).
- The presence of **multiple polar groups** and **no strong negative contributors** suggests a **high positive value**.

### **Predicted Property Value:**
Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar examples, the predicted property value for the given molecule is:

**0.812 ± 0.1**  
*(Likely close to **0.81219575**, similar to the highly oxygenated examples.)*  

### **Final Answer:**

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.1147798998014915
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like ring** (with N and C=O groups). This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic structures in the examples, which often have moderate to high property values when polar or conjugated.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - **Thiomethyl group (CS-)**: This is electron-donating and moderately polar (similar to sulfur-containing examples like `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` with a value of **0.29887534**).
   - **Tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: This is bulky and hydrophobic, which may slightly lower the property value unless balanced by other polar groups.
   - **Amide (N-C=O) and imine (N=C)**: These are polar and conjugated, likely increasing the property value (similar to `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` with **0.92658847** or `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` with **0.55653213**).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles a mix of:
  - Polar heterocycles with amide/imine groups (values ~0.5–0.9).
  - Sulfur-containing structures (values ~0.2–0.3).
  - Bulky alkyl groups (which may slightly reduce the value).
- The presence of **multiple polar groups (C=O, N, S)** suggests a higher value, but the **tert-butyl group** may temper this.

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of polar/conjugated features and hydrophobic bulk, a reasonable estimate is **~0.45–0.65**. 

Looking closely at similar examples:
- `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (similar polar heterocycle with alkyl) has **0.55653213**.
- `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (similar S/N/O heterocycle with tert-butyl) has **0.15495387**, but this is likely lower due to less conjugation.

Thus, **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is more conjugated and polar, so a higher value is justified. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.58** (rounded from an estimated range of 0.55–0.60). 

This aligns with the trend of polar heterocycles with moderate steric hindrance.
==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6422854335365197
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not directly given, but substituted benzenes appear frequently. 
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property of **-0.51321165**, while **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not directly given, but **CC(C)c1ccccc1** (isopropylbenzene) has **-0.03336496**. Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., -NH2) tend to lower the property value, while electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2 in **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) increase it (**0.78911675**).

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Groups**:
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** has **-0.93062834**, but this is complex.
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has **0.92615113**, similar to **CCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl pentanoate) with **0.92615113**. Esters seem to correlate with higher property values (~0.92-0.93).

3. **Phenyl Esters**:
   - The closest analog to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** (a cyclic urea derivative) with **0.25684587**, but this is not a great match.
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has **0.91933748**, suggesting aromatic ethers/esters have high values.

4. **Ethyl Group Contribution**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an ethyl ester of benzoic acid. Ethyl groups in other contexts (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2**) have **-0.69423665**, but this is skewed by the complex substituents.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** and **CCCCC(=O)OC** have values ~**0.926**,
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2) increase the value,
- Ethyl benzoate (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is an aromatic ester, likely similar to aliphatic esters but slightly lower due to the aromatic ring's partial electron-donating effect,

The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is approximately **0.85**.

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether, **0.919**) and **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate, **0.926**), the value for ethyl benzoate should be slightly lower due to the carbonyl's electron-withdrawing effect balancing the aromatic ring. A reasonable estimate is **~0.89**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: 0.89**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.6815542481957251
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane) by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Halogenated Aliphatic Compounds:**
   - **CI (iodomethane)**: 0.92439306 (high positive value)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 0.70623812 (moderate positive value)
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: -0.64163131 (negative value, but complex structure)
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: 0.87178271 (high positive value, brominated aromatic)

2. **Aliphatic Chains:**
   - **CCCCCCCO**: 0.90877021 (high positive value, heptanol)
   - **CCCCCCC=C**: 0.50699127 (moderate positive value, heptene)
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC**: 0.76123069 (moderate positive value, ketone)
   - **CCCCCC(=O)C**: 0.76123069 (same as above, ketone)

3. **Bromine Substituent Impact:**
   - The presence of bromine (**Br**) tends to increase the property value when attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: 0.87178271). For aliphatic chains, the effect is less clear, but **CI** (iodomethane) suggests halogens can contribute to higher values.

4. **Chain Length:**
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**) tend to have higher positive values, especially with polar groups (e.g., -OH). **CCCCCCCBr** is a 7-carbon chain with a polar bromine substituent, similar to **CCCCCCCO**.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- Structurally, **CCCCCCCBr** is most similar to **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol), where the -OH is replaced by -Br. Given that bromine is less polar than -OH but still contributes to a positive property value, I would expect the property to be slightly lower than **CCCCCCCO** (0.90877021) but still relatively high.
- Comparing to **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (0.87178271), an aromatic bromine compound, the aliphatic bromine might have a similar or slightly lower effect.
- The absence of other functional groups (like carbonyls or double bonds) simplifies the prediction.

### Final Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** to be approximately **0.85**.

**Predicted value: 0.85** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity).
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.013407088032965322
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's a breakdown of relevant observations:

1. **Small, simple, non-polar molecules** (e.g., `CCC`, `CC1=CCCCC1`) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., -0.081, -0.047).  
2. **Polar or functionalized small molecules** (e.g., `COC=O`, `NC(=O)N`) tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.798, -0.751).  
3. **Methanol (`CO`)** is a small polar molecule with an oxygen atom (hydroxyl group), similar to `CCC(C)CO` (property = -0.718) or `CCC(O)CCC` (property = 0.907). However, methanol is simpler and less bulky, so its property value is likely closer to the middle of the range for small polar molecules.  

Given that `CO` (methanol) is polar but lacks complex features (e.g., nitro groups, aromaticity, or multiple functional groups), its property value is likely **moderately negative**.  

Comparing to similar small polar molecules:  
- `CCC(C)CO` (similar hydroxyl group): -0.718  
- `COC=O` (small carbonyl): -0.798  
- `CCC(O)CCC` (hydroxyl in a longer chain): 0.907  

Methanol (`CO`) is simpler than these, so a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for `CO`: ~ -0.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on structural trends in the data.)  

---  
**Final answer: -0.5** (approximate, based on trends in the given examples).
