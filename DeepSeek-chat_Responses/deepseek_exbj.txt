SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.5758244669987017
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`  
This is a long-chain aliphatic ester with a 10-carbon chain (`CCCCCCCCCC`) and a methoxy group (`OC`) attached to a carbonyl (`(=O)`). 

From the examples, similar molecules with long aliphatic chains and ester functionalities have property values in the range of ~0.5 to ~0.8 (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the examples, which has a value of **0.58656596**). 

Additionally, the presence of the ester group (`(=O)OC`) tends to contribute positively to the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon chains (e.g., `CCCCCC` has a value of -0.54881257, while `CCOC(=O)CC` has a value of 0.74402761). 

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is likely close to the example with a similar structure:  

**Predicted property value: 0.58656596** (same as the example `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the provided data). 

If this exact molecule wasn't in the examples, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**, leaning toward the higher end due to the long aliphatic chain and ester group. However, since an identical molecule is present in the examples, we can directly use its value. 

### Final answer: **0.58656596**

Iteration: 2
SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.4846968159002285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like heterocycle** (specifically, a chlorinated benzofuran with a lactam-like group: **oc(=O)[nH]**). This is a fused bicyclic system with aromatic and polar components.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine atom** attached to the benzene ring (electron-withdrawing, likely decreasing the property value).
   - A **lactam-like group (oc(=O)[nH])** with hydrogen-bonding capability (could increase or decrease the property depending on context).
3. **Polarity**: The molecule is polar due to the C=O and N-H groups, but the chlorine adds lipophilicity.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property: -0.0987): This is a polychlorinated biphenyl. Our molecule is less chlorinated but has polar groups, so the property might be higher.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: 0.136): This is a polar, cyclic urea derivative. Our molecule has similar polar groups but is less symmetric and more aromatic, likely lowering the property slightly.
- **c1cncnc1** (property: 0.735): A purely aromatic, nitrogen-rich heterocycle. Our molecule is less aromatic and more polar, so the property would likely be lower.
- **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: 4.593): Highly chlorinated phenol. Our molecule is less chlorinated and has a different polar group, so the property would be much lower.

### Key Observations:
- The **lactam-like group (oc(=O)[nH])** is somewhat similar to the urea group in **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: 0.136), but our molecule is more aromatic and less polar overall.
- The **chlorine substituent** tends to decrease the property (e.g., **ClC=C** has -0.676, **ClCC** has -0.926).
- The **benzofuran-like core** is somewhat analogous to **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.588), but our molecule is more polar.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between:
- The **polar lactam-like group** (increasing the property slightly),
- The **chlorine substituent** (decreasing the property),
- The **aromatic system** (neutral to slightly negative effect),

A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.0**, but slightly negative due to the chlorine. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (-0.0987) is more chlorinated but less polar.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (0.136) is more polar but less aromatic.

Thus, the predicted property for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is approximately:  
**-0.15** (slightly negative due to chlorine, offset slightly by the polar group).  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value: -0.15**

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.8691113790813418
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **0.85085949**.
   - Nitro groups generally increase the property value compared to similar molecules without nitro groups (e.g., due to polarity or electronic effects).

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**) tend to have negative or small positive values.
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., **CC(C)C**) have slightly higher values than linear ones.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which likely contributes positively to the property.
   - The **isopropyl group (CC(C))** is less polar than aromatic or heterocyclic systems but still contributes modestly.

### Comparison:
- The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is structurally simpler than **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (which has a heterocycle and additional substituents). 
- The nitro group dominates the property, but the lack of an aromatic system or additional polar groups reduces the value compared to the heterocyclic example.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** should be **positive but lower than 0.85085949** (the heterocyclic nitro example). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as the exact property is not explicitly defined. The value reflects the nitro group's contribution moderated by the alkyl group.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.9081888216196226
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key structural features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure resembling steroids (e.g., multiple fused rings), which often contribute to lower property values (e.g., negative values in the examples).
2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - A hydroxyl group (`OH`), which increases polarity.
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`), which also increases polarity.
   - An additional `C(=O)CO` group (a carboxylate-like fragment), further increasing polarity.
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and rigid, which may reduce the property value.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property: **-0.91673605**): This is a steroid-like molecule with two carbonyl groups and no hydroxyl group. The property is negative and relatively low.
- **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**: This is similar but has an additional hydroxyl group and a `C(=O)CO` group, which would likely make it slightly more polar but not drastically change the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the example above but with slightly higher polarity due to the additional hydroxyl and carboxylate-like group, the property value should be in the same range but slightly less negative. 

**Predicted property value: -0.85**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend observed in the examples, where steroid-like structures with polar groups tend to have property values between -0.5 and -1.0.)*

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.7616957391208914
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). From the examples:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) tend to have positive property values, especially with multiple halogens (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has 0.8493949, and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 has 1.02070765).
   - Fluorine substituents (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 has 0.62296334) contribute positively but less than chlorine or bromine.

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide groups (C(=O)N). From the examples:
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has 0.67299068, suggesting amides contribute positively.
   - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 has -0.0934852, but this is a thioamide, which behaves differently.

3. **Chlorine Substituent**: The presence of Cl on the second aromatic ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2) is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.8493949) or Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (1.02070765), suggesting a significant positive contribution.

4. **Fluorine Substituents**: The two fluorines on the first ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1) are less impactful than chlorines but still positive (compare FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 at 0.62296334).

5. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule is polar due to the amides and halogens, which generally increases the property value (as seen in other polar examples).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: 0.8493949 (two Cl on aromatic ring)
- FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: 0.62296334 (three F on aromatic ring)
- NC(=O)c1cccnc1: 0.67299068 (amide + aromatic)
- The current molecule has two amides, two F, and one Cl, so we expect a higher value than FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 but lower than Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (1.02070765).

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the contributions:
- The two fluorines and one chlorine will give a base value around 0.8-1.0.
- The two amides will add ~0.2-0.3.
- The extended conjugation may slightly increase the value.

A reasonable prediction is **1.2 to 1.4**. Looking at similar examples like Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (1.02070765) and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.67299068), the combined effect suggests a value closer to **1.3**.

### Final Prediction:
**1.30** (approximate, likely between 1.2 and 1.4). 

Given the examples, a precise estimate would be **1.30**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on trends in the given data where halogens and polar groups increase the property value.)

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.08607944873202328
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate property values, often in the range of **0 to 1**. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate, not a pure ether but contains -O-) has a value of **0.744**.
     - `OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O` (a complex ether-containing sugar) has a value of **-0.921**, but this is influenced by many other polar groups.
   - Simple ethers like `CCCOC(C)C` are less polar than alcohols or carbonyls, so their values are typically lower than alcohols but higher than pure hydrocarbons.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length**:
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains generally decrease the property value (more hydrophobic). For example:
     - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclohexylhexane) has a value of **-0.833**.
     - `CCCCCO` (pentanol) has a value of **-0.549**, but the -OH group increases it compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - `CCCOC(C)C` has a short hydrocarbon chain (propyl + isopropyl), so it won't be as low as long-chain alkanes.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branched chains (like isopropyl) tend to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains due to reduced hydrophobicity. For example:
     - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) has a value of **2.001** (this seems unusually high and may be an outlier).
     - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol) has a value of **2.700**, but this is heavily influenced by the -OH group.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCOC(C)C` is structurally similar to `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate, value = **0.744**), but without the carbonyl group, the property value should be lower.
   - It is also similar to `CCCCCO` (pentanol, value = **-0.549**), but without the -OH group, the value should be lower.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends:
- Ethers with short hydrocarbon chains typically have property values in the range of **0 to 0.5**.
- Branching (isopropyl) may slightly increase the value compared to linear ethers.
- No strongly polar or functional groups are present to push the value higher.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOC(C)C** is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (with an expected range of 0.1 to 0.4).  

This aligns with the moderate polarity of ethers and the small size/branching of the molecule.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 3.847415045831764
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is present in other molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property: 0.02750618) and `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (property: -0.24567431). Halogens (Br, Cl) often contribute to moderate or negative property values.
   - It has a **lactam-like structure** (cyclic amide with C=O and NH), similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (property: 0.76046988) but with additional complexity.
   - The **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is present, which is common in many examples with varying effects (e.g., `CC(C)SC(C)C` has a positive property of 0.58245029, while `CC(C)CCO` has a negative property of -0.1761233).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The **bromine and carbonyl groups** increase polarity, which may lower the property value (as seen in other polar/halogenated molecules).
   - The **cyclic structure with conjugated C=O and NH** may introduce some stabilization, but the bromine likely dominates the effect.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property: 0.02750618) has a bromine and amide group, similar to our molecule, but our molecule is more complex (cyclic, additional C=O).
   - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (property: -0.39823914) is a fused aromatic system with nitrogen, showing that nitrogen-containing heterocycles can have negative values.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property: 0.8493949) has halogens but is simpler, suggesting that complexity and additional polar groups reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the **bromine substituent**, **cyclic amide structure**, and **alkyl group**, the molecule is likely to have a **moderate negative property value**, similar to other halogenated or polar heterocycles. 

From the examples, the closest analogs suggest a value between **-0.4 and -0.8**. Considering the additional complexity (two carbonyls and bromine), I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This aligns with molecules like `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (-0.64167489) or `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (-0.39823914), but slightly more negative due to the bromine and additional polar groups.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.4202356132948588
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the structure of the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.727). 
   - Simpler fused aromatics like **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** have values around -0.55.

2. **Biphenyl Structure**:
   - Biphenyl consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which is less conjugated than fused polycyclic aromatics but more conjugated than isolated benzene rings.
   - The lack of heteroatoms or polar groups suggests the property value will be modestly negative, similar to other neutral aromatic systems.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **0.263**, but the methyl groups may slightly increase the value.
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (benzene fused to a cyclohexane) has a value of **-0.470**, which is a reasonable reference for a non-fused but linked aromatic system.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2)** is likely slightly more negative than **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** but less negative than fused polycyclic systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This aligns with the trend where linked (but not fused) aromatic systems without polar substituents have modestly negative values.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics):**
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.0139625  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with substituent): -0.71966845  
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.24261119  
   - **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (naphthalene): 0.39109505  
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene): -0.1123259  

   Hydrocarbons generally have property values close to zero, with slight variations based on branching or unsaturation.

2. **Oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, carbonyls, ethers):**
   - **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** (tertiary alcohol): 3.96173779 (high value)  
   - **Oc1ccccc1O** (catechol): 1.25968537  
   - **CC1CO1** (epoxide): -0.68852264  

   Oxygenated compounds show a wide range, with alcohols often having higher values.

3. **Nitrogen-containing groups (amines, amides, nitro):**
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (aromatic amine): 0.8493949  
   - **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (complex N/S/O): 0.90473077  

   Nitrogen groups tend to increase the property value slightly.

4. **Sulfur-containing groups:**
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** (complex S/P): 13.72526382 (extreme outlier, likely due to P=S)  
   - **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1** (thioamide): 3.7234627  
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (thioether + P=S): -0.450699  

   Simple thiols or sulfides are not directly represented, but sulfur tends to increase the property value unless paired with electronegative atoms (e.g., P=S).

5. **Halogen-containing groups:**
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl): -0.25359357  
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (chlorinated hydrocarbon): -0.492469  

   Halogens (Cl, Br) often reduce the property value slightly.

### Analysis of **CCCCS**:
- **Structure:** Linear aliphatic thiol (1-butanethiol).  
- **Key features:**  
  - Alkyl chain (similar to hydrocarbons, which have values near zero).  
  - Terminal thiol (-SH) group, which is polar but less electronegative than oxygen.  

### Comparison:
- **CCCCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.0139625  
- **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.24261119  
- **CCCCCCCC=C** (linear alkene): -0.1123259  

Thiols are less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons. The property value is likely slightly higher than a pure hydrocarbon but lower than an alcohol.  

### Prediction:
Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCS** is **~0.2 to 0.5**. A plausible value is **0.35**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCS: 0.35**
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 2.5902575223612883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -CO) tend to have lower or moderate property values unless combined with large hydrophobic regions.
   - Fully nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C**) have higher positive values (e.g., 1.41279744 for **CCC(C)(C)C**).
   - Introducing an -OH group (hydroxyl) often reduces the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon analogs (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC** has 2.59025752, but this is an outlier; other -OH examples like **CC(C)CC(C)O** have 0.58245029).

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - Branched hydrocarbons tend to have higher values than linear ones (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** has 2.00072956, while linear **CCCC/C=C/C** has -0.06569323).
   - The presence of an -OH group reduces the value significantly compared to the nonpolar counterpart.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: 2.59025752 (high value, likely due to branching and -OH).
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: 0.58245029 (branched + -OH).
   - **CCC(C)(C)C**: 2.00072956 (branched, no -OH).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched hydrocarbon (**C(C)(C)**) with a terminal -OH group.
- It is structurally similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property: 2.59025752) but with a shorter chain and -OH at the end.
- The -OH group will likely reduce the property value compared to a fully nonpolar branched hydrocarbon (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** with 2.00072956).
- Comparing to **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property: 0.58245029), which is less branched but also has -OH, we might expect a slightly higher value due to more branching.

### Predicted Property:
Given the branching and -OH group, a reasonable estimate is between **0.5 and 1.5**. A plausible value is:  
**1.25000000** (rounded to 8 decimal places for consistency with the examples).

### Final Answer:
**1.25000000**

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.23679145406559984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **methyl-dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene** (simplified: a methyl-substituted fused bicyclic aromatic system). It consists of:
- A methyl group (**Me**) attached to a fused bicyclic aromatic system (two benzene rings sharing two adjacent carbons, forming a naphthalene-like core but with a different connectivity).

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): 0.735
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene): 1.815
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c1** (toluene derivative): 0.849
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene): 1.428
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc12** (methyl-naphthalene): 0.561

   Aromatic systems with more rings or alkyl substitutions tend to have higher values (e.g., naphthalene derivatives ~0.5–0.6, benzene ~0.7, alkyl-substituted benzenes ~0.8–1.8).

2. **Fused Bicyclic Aromatics**:
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc12** (methyl-naphthalene): 0.561
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-anthracene/phenanthrene-like): -0.303

   Larger fused systems (e.g., anthracene-like) tend to have lower or negative values, while smaller fused systems (e.g., naphthalene-like) are closer to 0.5–0.6.

3. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Methyl groups generally increase the property value (e.g., toluene derivatives > benzene).

### Prediction for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
This is a **methyl-substituted dibenzocyclooctene** (similar to methyl-naphthalene but with a different ring fusion). Given:
- It is smaller than anthracene-like systems (which have values ~-0.3).
- It is larger than naphthalene (methyl-naphthalene: 0.561).
- The methyl group adds a slight positive contribution.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than methyl-naphthalene due to the less common ring fusion but higher than anthracene-like systems. 

**Predicted value: ~0.45** (between methyl-naphthalene's 0.561 and anthracene-like -0.303, but closer to the former due to smaller size).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **Cc1ccc2ccccc12** (0.561) and **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (-0.303), this molecule is intermediate in size. A good guess is **~0.35–0.40**, but leaning toward the higher end due to the methyl group.

**Final predicted value: 0.40** (conservative estimate balancing ring size and substitution effects). 

However, given that **Cc1ccc2ccccc12** is 0.561 and this is a very similar system (just a different fusion pattern), the value is likely closer to **0.50**. 

After reconsidering, the most plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.50** (similar to methyl-naphthalene derivatives).

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 1.1680174143942255
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Hydantoin-like structures** (e.g., cyclic ureides with carbonyl groups) tend to have property values in the **positive range** when substituted with hydrophobic or aliphatic groups. For example:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has a value of **0.57111465**.
   - The given molecule is similar but has an additional **C(C)CCC** substituent instead of just **C**.

2. **Aliphatic substituents** (e.g., **CC=C**, **C(C)CCC**) generally increase the property value slightly compared to simpler analogs. For instance:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** has a relatively high value (**2.69970465**) due to bulky aliphatic groups.
   - The substituent **C(C)CCC** is less bulky than **C(C)(C)**, so the increase would be modest.

3. **Electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., carbonyls, halogens) can influence the property, but in this case, the dominant factor seems to be the aliphatic substitution.

### Comparison to the Closest Example:
The molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has a value of **0.57111465**. The given molecule replaces the **C** substituent with **C(C)CCC**, which adds more hydrophobic character but is not as bulky as **C(C)(C)**. 

### Predicted Property:
Given the additional aliphatic chain (**C(C)CCC**), we can expect a **slight increase** in the property value compared to **0.57111465**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.6 to 0.8**. 

For specificity, I predict:  
**0.65**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend observed in the provided data for similar structural modifications.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.6229633385431526
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`  
This is **benzene substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Halogenated aromatic compounds** tend to have property values in the **positive range**, especially when halogens are electronegative (e.g., Cl, Br, I):
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`: **0.8493949**  
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: **0.8493949**  
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`: **-0.01256349** (more chlorines reduce the value slightly).  

2. **Fluorine substitution** is highly electronegative, and the **CF3 group** is strongly electron-withdrawing. This likely increases the property value compared to non-fluorinated analogs.

3. **Simple aromatic systems** without strong polar groups (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) are not in the examples, but halogenation generally increases the value.

4. The **CF3 group** is more polar and electron-withdrawing than Cl or Br, so we expect a **higher value** than the chlorinated/brominated examples (~0.85).

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of CF3 and the trend from halogenated aromatics, the property value for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` is likely **higher than 0.85** but not excessively so (since the examples don't show extreme values for single substitutions).  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: ~1.0**  

(Exact matches aren't possible without a model, but this aligns with the trend of halogenated aromatics and the stronger effect of CF3.)  

**Final answer: 1.0**

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.16395494852047762
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capacity, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property value: **10.61750723**) have very high property values, likely due to strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophilicity.
2. The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **five hydroxyl groups** and an ether linkage, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding, similar to the polyol in the examples.

Given this, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** should be **very high**, comparable to the other polyol in the dataset. 

### Predicted property value:  
**~10.6** (similar to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, which has a value of **10.61750723**).  

This is based on the structural similarity and the trend that highly hydroxylated molecules exhibit exceptionally high values for this property.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -0.918264466455487
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, sulfurs, halogens, etc.). The property values range widely, with highly polar or polyhydroxylated molecules (e.g., sugars like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` at **10.617**) showing very high values, while nonpolar or halogenated aliphatics (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(...)` at **-0.492**) tend toward negative or low-positive values.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
**SMILES:** `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`  
This is a steroid-like structure with:
1. **Two acetyl groups (`CC(=O)O-` and `-CC(=O)-`)** contributing modestly (similar to `CCOC(=O)C` at **0.242**).
2. **Two hydroxyl groups (`C3(O)` and `C(O)`)**: These increase the property (e.g., polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)...` score **10.617**, but here only two -OH groups are present).
3. **Conjugated carbonyl (`C=CC1(C)C=O`)**: Similar to `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (**-0.063**), but conjugated systems may slightly raise the value.
4. **Steroid core**: Bulky aliphatic rings (e.g., `CCC4(C)C2CCC21C` in examples) often yield negative or near-zero values (e.g., **-0.909** for `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`).

### Prediction:
The molecule combines moderately polar groups (acetyl, hydroxyl) with a large hydrophobic core. The hydroxyls will raise the value, but the steroidal bulk and lack of extreme polarity (e.g., no sulfates or polyhydroxylation) suggest a mid-range positive value.  

**Estimated property value:** **~0.5 to 1.0**  
Given the closest structural analogs (e.g., steroids with carbonyls/hydroxyls in the examples), a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted value: 0.75** (interpolating between similar cases).  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.*

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -0.9253222084797391
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a ketone, which suggests moderate polarity and significant molecular complexity.

Breaking it down:
- The molecule has a hydroxyl group (`O` attached to a ring, similar to some examples with `O` in rings (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` with property 1.25968537 or `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` with property -0.90495733).
- It contains a ketone (`C=O`), which is present in some examples with intermediate values (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` with 1.1747131).
- The structure is highly fused and rigid (multiple rings), which may lower the property value compared to simpler structures (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` with -0.56634524).

Comparing to similar examples:
- The hydroxyl and ketone groups suggest a value between -0.9 and 1.2.
- The fused ring system (like steroids) in the examples tends to push the value toward the negative side (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` at -0.90495733).

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` is likely in the range of **-0.7 to -0.9**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with fused rings and polar groups). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.18973426987623454
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both the acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (0.411): Contains an aromatic ring with an aldehyde (C=O) and methoxy (OCH3) group. The nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than the aldehyde, but the acetamide is less electron-withdrawing than the aldehyde.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (0.673): Nitrobenzene, which has a nitro group on an aromatic ring. This is simpler but similar to our target molecule.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (1.200): Similar to nitrobenzene but with an additional methoxy group (electron-donating), which increases the property value compared to nitrobenzene.
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1** (not directly given, but similar to acetamide-substituted aromatics): The presence of the acetamide group (electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro) would reduce the property value compared to nitrobenzene.

3. **Combined Effect**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and tends to increase the property value (as seen in nitrobenzene: 0.673).
   - The acetamide group is moderately electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro, which would slightly counteract the nitro group's effect.
   - The molecule is **N-acetyl-4-nitroaniline**, where the nitro and acetamide are para to each other. The para substitution may lead to some resonance effects, but the net electron-withdrawing nature dominates.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is likely slightly lower than nitrobenzene (0.673) due to the acetamide group's presence but higher than molecules with purely electron-donating groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.55**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.6262394215357338
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular polarity, functional groups, and overall electronic distribution. Here's the reasoning:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: This is a polar and electron-withdrawing group, similar to phosphoryl groups but with sulfur, which may slightly reduce polarity compared to P=O.
2. **Thioether linkage (S-C)**: This is moderately polar but less so than an oxygen ether.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (Cl attached to benzene)**: Chlorine is electron-withdrawing and increases polarity (see examples like Clc1cccc2ccccc12 with property 0.46202816).
4. **Lactam (c(=O)oc)**: This is a polar group, contributing to the property value.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but less impactful than hydroxyl or carbonyl groups.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- Molecules with **Cl on aromatic rings** (e.g., Clc1cccc2ccccc12) have property values around **0.462**.
- Molecules with **P=O or P=S** (none in the examples, but phosphoryl groups are highly polar; P=S is less polar but still significant).
- Molecules with **thioether (S-C)** like CSSC have a property of **-0.804**, but this is a disulfide, which is less polar than the thioether here.
- The **lactam (c(=O)oc)** is similar to other carbonyl-containing groups, which often have negative or slightly positive values (e.g., C=O in CC(=O)OC has 0.744, but this is an ester).

### Synthesis of observations:
- The **Cl on the aromatic ring** pushes the property toward positive values (e.g., ~0.46).
- The **P=S and thioether** are less polar than P=O but still contribute negatively (likely offsetting some of the Cl effect).
- The **lactam** is polar but not as strongly as a nitro or carboxyl group (which have higher positive values).

Given these competing effects, the property is likely **moderately positive but less than Cl-only aromatics**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

This balances the electron-withdrawing Cl (positive contribution) with the moderately polar P=S and thioether (negative contributions). The value is closer to the lower end of Cl-containing aromatics (e.g., 0.24466459 for OCc1ccccc1, which has an OH instead of Cl but similar polarity). 

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**0.25** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.4127974399021008
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the structure of this molecule.

### Key Observations:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - Simple alcohols like **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) have property values around **-0.31179036** (see the example **CC(C)CO**).
   - The presence of more alkyl groups (bulkier alcohols) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear alcohols (e.g., **CCC** has **-0.92635963**, while **CC(C)CO** is **-0.31179036**).

2. **Branched vs. Linear Chains**:
   - Branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)(C)C**) tend to have higher property values than linear chains (e.g., **CCC** is **-0.92635963**, while **CC(=C)C** is **0.24261119**).
   - The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (bulkier than **CC(C)CO**), so its property value should be slightly higher than **-0.31179036**.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has a property value of **0.10649463**.
   - **CCCCC(CC)CO** (another branched alcohol) has a property value of **1.07919911**, but this is a larger molecule with more branching.
   - **CC(C)CO** is **-0.31179036**, and **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched, so we expect a value between **-0.31179036** and **0.10649463**.

### Prediction:
Given that **CC(C)(C)CO** is a more branched version of **CC(C)CO**, its property value should be slightly higher than **-0.31179036** but not as high as **0.10649463** (which has a longer chain). A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.1 to 0.0**.

From the examples, the closest analog is **CC(C)CO** (**-0.31179036**), and adding another methyl group (making it tertiary) would likely increase the value by ~0.3, leading to a prediction near **0.0**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.04920123** (similar to **CCCCCCC(C)O**, which is **0.04920123**, another branched alcohol). 

However, since **CC(C)(C)CO** is more compact, a slightly lower value is plausible. A refined estimate is **~0.02**.

But given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 0.04920123** (same as **CCCCCCC(C)O**, as they are structurally similar in branching). 

If we adjust for the smaller size of **CC(C)(C)CO**, a slightly lower value like **0.02** might be more accurate, but the closest match in the examples is **0.04920123**.

Thus, the final answer is:

**0.04920123**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 1.0819082078086744
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Systems**:
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings (e.g., purine-like or imidazole-like structures) tend to have property values in the range of **~1.0 to ~2.5**.
   - Example:  
     - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (a fluorinated uracil derivative) has a value of **2.34049479**.  
     - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (a uracil-like structure) has a value of **1.98162956**.

2. **Presence of Carbonyl (C=O) and NH Groups**:
   - The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is a **purine-2,6-dione (xanthine)** core, which has two carbonyl groups and two NH groups in a fused bicyclic system. This is structurally similar to the examples above, suggesting a value in the **~1.5 to ~2.5** range.

3. **Comparison with Other Heterocycles**:
   - Simpler nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine or imidazole derivatives) often have lower values (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1` has **0.80992282**), but fused systems with additional polar groups (like C=O) increase the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (2.340) and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (1.981), and considering the additional nitrogen in the fused ring system, the property value for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is likely in the **higher end of this range**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.15**  
*(This is an estimate based on the closest analogs in the dataset. The actual value would likely fall between 2.0 and 2.5.)*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.20092436822727996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., alcohols, esters, amines) tend to have property values that vary widely, but some trends emerge:
     - **Esters (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC)**: The example with a phosphate ester has a high value (9.033), but simpler esters like **CCOC=C** (vinyl ether) have a negative value (-0.484).
     - **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: Molecules with aldehydes or ketones (e.g., **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1**) have positive values (0.411), while some complex carbonyl-containing molecules (e.g., steroids) have negative values.
   - **Methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O)** is a simple ester with a carbonyl group and an ether linkage.

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - Small, branched molecules (e.g., **CC(C)O**, isopropanol) tend to have negative values (-0.563), while some branched ketones (e.g., **CCC(C)C(=O)C**) have positive values (2.388).
   - Methyl acetate is a small, branched ester.

3. **Electronegative Atoms (O, Cl, N, etc.)**:
   - The presence of oxygen (e.g., in alcohols, ethers) can lead to negative or positive values depending on the context. For example:
     - **CCOC(C)C** (ether) has -0.086.
     - **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O** (complex ether) has -0.474.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC=C** (vinyl ether) has a value of -0.484.
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (anisaldehyde) has a value of 0.411.
   - Methyl acetate is structurally between these two: it has an ester group (like anisaldehyde) but is simpler (like vinyl ether).

### Prediction for CC(C)OC=O:
Given the trends:
- Simple esters with no additional polar groups tend to have moderately negative or near-zero values.
- The carbonyl group in methyl acetate may contribute a slight positive influence, but the ether-like (OC=O) linkage may pull the value toward the negative side.
- The small size and branching (like isopropanol) suggest a value in the negative to low-positive range.

**Estimated property value for CC(C)OC=O: ~0.1 to 0.3**.  
A reasonable prediction would be **0.2** (similar to the slightly positive trend seen in other small carbonyl-containing molecules).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O: 0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.8149316260977042
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (N-aryl urea). The structure is symmetric, with two aniline (N-phenyl) groups connected via a carbonyl (C=O) group.
2. **Aromatic Rings**: Two benzene rings (phenyl groups) are present, similar to many examples in the dataset (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `Cc1cccc2ccccc12`).
3. **Polarity**: The urea group (N-C=O-N) is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, but the phenyl rings add hydrophobicity.
4. **Substituents**: No electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups are present on the phenyl rings (unlike some examples with halogens or nitro groups).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **N-aryl amides/ureas**: 
  - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` has a property value of **0.23395883**. This is a carbamate (less polar than urea) with methyl and aryl groups.
  - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (nicotinamide) has a value of **0.67299068**, reflecting higher polarity due to the pyridine ring and primary amide.
- **Diaryl ureas**: The symmetry and lack of strong polar substituents suggest moderate polarity, but the urea group is more polar than simple aryl ethers or hydrocarbons.
- **Aromatic systems**: 
  - `c1ccncc1` (pyridine) has **0.73516671**, but this is more polar due to the nitrogen in the ring.
  - `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (methylnaphthalene) has **0.46202816**, reflecting a purely hydrophobic system.

### Prediction:
The urea group increases polarity compared to purely aromatic systems, but the lack of additional polar substituents (like OH, Cl, or NO2) limits the property value. The symmetric diaryl urea structure is somewhat analogous to nicotinamide but with less polarity due to phenyl rings instead of pyridine.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate would be **between 0.5 and 0.8**. A closer match is likely around **0.65**, similar to nicotinamide but slightly lower due to the less polar phenyl rings.

### Final Predicted Property Value:

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.5663452398085389
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused benzene rings.

From the examples:
- Aromatic systems with multiple fused rings (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, property = -0.66972918) tend to have negative property values.
- Fluorene is structurally similar to these fused aromatic systems but has a slightly less extended conjugation than larger PAHs like the one above.

Comparing to other examples:
- Naphthalene-like systems (two fused rings) have values around -0.5 to -0.7.
- Fluorene (three fused rings with a bridging carbon) is intermediate in size and aromaticity.

Given this, the predicted property value for **fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.7**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., carbonyls, sulfonamides, halogens, etc.). The molecule in question is:

**NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**  

This structure contains:
1. A **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)**, which is polar and often associated with negative property values in the examples (e.g., sulfonamides like `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` at -0.637).
2. An **aromatic ring with an amino group (N)**, which can contribute to polarity/hydrogen bonding (similar to `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O` at -0.608).
3. A **guanidine-like moiety (NC(=N)N)**, which is highly polar and basic, likely reducing the property value further.

### Observations from the examples:
- Sulfonamides and polar groups (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12` at -0.055) tend to yield negative values.
- Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO₂) or hydrogen-bond donors (e.g., OH, NH) also correlate with negative values.
- The presence of multiple polar groups (like here) typically drives the property more negative.

### Predicted property value:
Given the combined effects of the sulfonamide, aromatic amine, and guanidine-like group, the predicted value should be **more negative than most sulfonamide examples** but not as extreme as small polar molecules like `CNN` (-0.926).  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75** (likely between -0.7 and -0.8 based on the trend).  

### Final answer:  
**-0.75** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 6.278232512114524
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. The molecule in question is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: These are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which in the examples tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a high value of 0.99023874).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is also highly electron-withdrawing and hydrophobic, which may further increase the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is moderately polar but less impactful than the nitro groups.
4. **Aromatic ring with substitutions**: The presence of multiple nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group on the aromatic ring suggests strong polarization.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **0.99023874** (one nitro group and a hydroxyl).
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of **0.12441085** (less polar than nitro groups).
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.64167489** (one nitro group but offset by other features).

Given the **two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group**, the molecule is highly polar and electron-deficient, likely leading to a **positive and relatively high property value**. However, the tertiary amine and alkene (CC(C)=C) might slightly reduce the effect.

### Predicted property value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, I predict a value around **0.85**. 

**Final answer: 0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity to high-value examples).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.20092436822727996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (OH)**: Generally have negative property values (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O` = -0.01396, `OC1CCCCCC1` = -0.69213).
   - **Esters (COOR)**: Mixed trends, but often slightly negative or positive (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cccnc1` = 0.29661, `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` = 0.06417).
   - **Aldehydes (CHO)**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., `CCCC=O` = -0.48421, `O=C1CCCCC1` = -0.62881).
   - **Ethers (OR)**: Can be positive or negative depending on context (e.g., `CC(C)SC(C)C` = 0.58245, `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` = -0.09394).
   - **Branching**: Branched chains often have higher values than linear ones (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)O` = 1.41280 vs. `CCCCCC(C)O` = -0.01396).

2. **Specific Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(=O)N` (acetamide) = 0.17459 (positive, due to amide).
   - `CC(C)CCOC=O` (branched ester/aldehyde-like) = 0.20058 (positive).
   - `CCCC=O` (linear aldehyde) = -0.48421 (negative).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is an ester (specifically, **methyl isobutyrate** or a similar branched ester) with a branched alkyl group (`CC(C)O`) and an aldehyde-like fragment (`C=O`).
- The branching (`CC(C)`) suggests a potential increase in the property value compared to linear analogs.
- The `OC=O` (ester) group is similar to `CCOC=O` in `CC(C)CCOC=O` (property = 0.20058), but with less branching.
- The absence of strongly negative groups (e.g., OH, Cl) suggests the value may be slightly positive.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to `CC(C)CCOC=O` (0.20058) but with slightly less branching, the property for `CC(C)OC=O` is likely **slightly lower but still positive**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.15** (range: 0.1 to 0.2). 

### Final Answer:
**0.15**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 1.3995805697594448
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring with:
   - Two methyl groups (**C** or **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**).
   - One hydroxyl group (**O**).

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): Property value = **0.80992282**.
     - This has a benzene ring with one hydroxyl group.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (dimethylbenzene, e.g., xylene): Not directly in the examples, but similar to **Cc1ccccc1C** (toluene-like structures).
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**: A highly hydroxylated benzene with a methoxycarbonyl group, property = **1.5840681** (higher due to multiple polar groups).
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** (triphenyl): Property = **-0.81527036** (non-polar, large hydrophobic structure).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Hydroxyl groups (**O**) tend to increase the property value (e.g., phenol = **0.80992282** vs. benzene = no direct example, but less polar groups likely lower).
   - Methyl groups (**C**) are weakly electron-donating but generally reduce polarity compared to hydroxyl groups.
   - The molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has one hydroxyl and two methyl groups, so it is more polar than plain toluene but less polar than phenol or multi-hydroxylated benzenes.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Phenol (**c1ccccc1O**): **0.80992282**.
   - Toluene (**Cc1ccccc1**): Not in examples, but likely lower than phenol (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1C** = **0.75756576**).
   - The given molecule is between these two in polarity: less than phenol but more than toluene.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** should be slightly lower than phenol but higher than toluene-like structures. A reasonable estimate is around **0.6** to **0.7**. 

Looking at similar examples:
- **CCc1ccccc1C** = **0.75756576** (two alkyl groups, no hydroxyl).
- **c1ccccc1O** = **0.80992282** (one hydroxyl, no alkyl).

The molecule has one hydroxyl and two methyl groups, so the hydroxyl increases the value while the methyl groups slightly decrease it. A good compromise is slightly below phenol's value.

### Final Prediction:
**0.65** (approximate; exact value depends on finer trends in the data, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the given examples). 

However, reviewing the examples more carefully, **CCc1ccccc1C** (two alkyl groups) is **0.75756576**, and **c1ccccc1O** (one hydroxyl) is **0.80992282**. The molecule here has one hydroxyl and two methyl groups, so the value is likely slightly lower than phenol but higher than xylene-like structures. 

A refined estimate: **0.75** (closer to **CCc1ccccc1C** but adjusted for the hydroxyl group). 

Given the data, the most precise estimate is likely between **0.7** and **0.8**. 

### Exact Prediction:
**0.75** (interpolated from similar examples). 

However, to match the precision of the given examples, I'll provide a more specific value: **0.724**. 

But reviewing the examples again, **CCc1ccccc1C** is **0.75756576**, and **c1ccccc1O** is **0.80992282**. The molecule is in between, so averaging these (with slight downward adjustment for the second methyl): **~0.78**. 

After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is:

**0.78**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.4386398221786039
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P(=S)) Fragments**:  
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragment (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) consistently have a property value of **0.96647992**.  
   - This suggests that the **P(=S)(OC)2** core contributes strongly to the property, and substitutions on the aromatic ring do not significantly alter the value as long as the core is intact.

2. **Aromatic Substitutions**:  
   - The aromatic ring in the given molecule is substituted with **SC** (thioether) and **C** (methyl).  
   - In other examples, substitutions like **Cl**, **Br**, or **I** on the aromatic ring do not change the property value for the phosphorothioate core.  
   - The **SC** group is somewhat similar to **Cl** or **Br** in terms of electronegativity and sterics, so it is unlikely to drastically alter the property.

3. **Methyl Group (C)**:  
   - Methyl substitutions (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1`) tend to increase the property slightly, but in this case, the dominant factor is the **P(=S)(OC)2** core.

### Conclusion:
Since the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** retains the **COP(=S)(OC)O** core and the aromatic substitutions (**SC** and **C**) are not drastically different from the halogens in the training examples, the property value should be very close to **0.96647992**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.96647992**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.10890116513579869
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of **3.20726863**, and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **0.06429327**).
2. The molecule in question is **hexachlorinated** (6 Cl atoms) and has a **biphenyl-like structure** with chlorines on both rings.
3. Comparing to similar structures:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (5 Cl atoms) → **0.06429327**
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (6 Cl atoms) → **0.33049383** (this is very close to our target molecule but with slightly different substitution).

### Prediction:
Given the **high chlorination** and **symmetry**, the value should be **positive and moderately high**, similar to the examples above. The closest analog is `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (0.33049383), but with one less chlorine on the second ring. However, the additional chlorine in the given molecule may **increase the value slightly** due to enhanced electron-withdrawing effects.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is:  
**0.45** (estimated based on interpolation of the given examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of chlorinated aromatic compounds in the dataset.)*

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.24261119412382215
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) tends to increase the property value significantly. For example:
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene) has a high value of **2.02565397** due to the electron-withdrawing nitrile groups, but nitro groups are even more polar/electron-withdrawing.
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene) has a very high value of **2.68868674** due to multiple nitro groups.
     - `Nc1ccccc1O` (aminophenol) has a value of **1.25968537**, but nitro groups are more impactful than hydroxyl or amino groups.

2. **Alkyl Chain Length**:
   - Shorter alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`, propane) have negative values (e.g., `CCC` = **-0.92635963**).
   - Longer alkyl chains reduce the impact of polar groups (e.g., `CCCCCC=O` = **-0.28392149** vs. `CC=O` would likely be higher).

3. **Combination of Nitro + Alkyl**:
   - The nitro group is attached to a short alkyl chain (propyl group, `CCC`). This is similar to `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (a nitroaromatic with alkyl chains), which has a very high value (**5.72316295**), but this is likely due to multiple nitro groups and aromaticity. 
   - For a single nitro group on a short alkyl chain, the value should be positive but not as extreme as aromatic nitro compounds.

### Prediction:
- The nitro group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, which will dominate over the small alkyl chain's slight negative contribution.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `Nc1ccccc1O` (1.25968537) has polar groups but no nitro, so `CCCN(=O)=O` should be higher.
  - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (2.02565397) has two nitrile groups, so a single nitro group on a small alkyl chain should be lower but still positive.
  - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (2.68868674) has three nitro groups, so one nitro group should be much lower.

### Estimated Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** is around **1.5 to 2.0**. A precise interpolation suggests **~1.8**.

However, looking at the trend for single nitro groups on small alkyl chains (none in the examples), but considering the high impact of nitro, I'll predict:

**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 1.75** 

(Note: If forced to pick a specific value from the given examples' range, I'd lean toward **1.58951447**, similar to `CC(=C)C=C`, but nitro is more polar, so **1.75** is more accurate.) 

But since the examples with nitro groups are higher, I'll adjust to **2.0**.

Final answer: **2.0** (rounded from estimated trend). 

However, reviewing again, `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` is 2.025, and `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` is 2.688, so a single nitro on alkyl is likely lower. Maybe **1.6**.

Given uncertainty, I'll say **1.6**. 

But the closest in examples is `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (2.025), so perhaps **1.8** is better.

Final prediction: **1.8**. 

(Exact would require more data, but this is a reasonable estimate.) 

**Predicted value: 1.8**
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 1.020707654773106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Substituents and Halogens**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have property values in the range of ~0.5 to ~0.8, unless other functional groups significantly alter the value.
   - For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of **0.8493949** (similar to `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` but with Cl instead of F).
     - `COc1ccccc1Cl` has a value of **0.75756576** (Cl substituent on an aromatic ring).
     - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has a value of **-0.18286149**, but this is a heavily chlorinated biphenyl, which is structurally very different.

2. **Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl/Br, but its impact on the property doesn't seem drastically different in the given examples. For instance:
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` has a value of **0.02750618**, but this also includes an amide group, which likely lowers the value.
     - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.8493949) is structurally similar to `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, but with Cl instead of F.

3. **Bromine Substituents**:
   - Bromine tends to increase the property slightly compared to chlorine in similar contexts. For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.8493949) vs. `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (no exact example, but `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` is 0.53217251).
     - `c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12` has a value of **0.23679145**, but this is a fused ring system, which complicates comparison.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple monosubstituted aromatic rings with halogens tend to have values around **0.5–0.8**, as seen in:
     - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.8493949)
     - `COc1ccccc1Cl` (0.75756576)
     - `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (0.74680771)

### Prediction for `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`:
- This is a monosubstituted aromatic ring with F and Br. Structurally, it is very similar to `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.8493949), but with F instead of Cl. 
- Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl, but the property doesn't seem to vary drastically between F and Cl in the given examples. 
- Bromine's presence likely keeps the value in the higher end of the range (~0.8). 

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` would be slightly lower than `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.8493949) but still in the same range. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.78** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value could be closer to 0.8). 

However, looking at the examples more carefully, `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` is 0.8493949, and `COc1ccccc1Cl` is 0.75756576. Since `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` is between these two in terms of substituent effects, a good estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.80** (approximating to the nearest observed trend). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, let's say **0.798** (a slight reduction from 0.849 due to F being slightly less bulky than Cl). 

However, since the exact relationship isn't perfectly linear, and given the examples, the safest bet is to predict a value close to the other halogenated aromatics, such as **0.80**. 

But reviewing again, `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` is 0.849, and `COc1ccccc1Cl` is 0.757, so `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` is likely in between, perhaps **0.80**. 

Given the lack of exact fluorine examples, I'll stick with:

**Predicted property value: 0.80** (or more precisely, **0.798** to match the format). 

But since the examples have longer decimals, let's approximate to **0.798**. 

However, looking back at `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.849) and `COc1ccccc1Cl` (0.757), and considering that F is somewhat intermediate in effect between Cl and OMe, a reasonable guess is:

**Final answer: 0.798** (but likely closer to 0.80 given the data). 

Given the ambiguity, I'll round to **0.80**. 

But to be precise, let's take the average of `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.849) and `COc1ccccc1Cl` (0.757), which is ~0.803, and adjust slightly downward for F being less bulky than Cl, giving **0.798**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` is:

**0.798**

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.4901513095735209
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary alcohol (C-OH)** and **tertiary carbon centers (quaternary carbons)**. 
   - It is a **bicyclic hydrocarbon** with a rigid, saturated structure (no double bonds or aromaticity).

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: This is a complex steroid-like molecule with multiple rings, an alcohol, and carbonyl groups. Its property value is **-0.92536437**.
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: This is another rigid, substituted bicyclic molecule with a property value of **-0.93632661**.
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Another steroid-like molecule with a value of **-0.86284432**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Rigid, saturated bicyclic structures with alcohols tend to have **negative property values** in the dataset (typically between **-0.7 and -0.9**).
   - The absence of highly polar or charged groups (e.g., sulfonamides, nitro groups) or aromatic systems suggests the property value will not be extremely negative or positive.
   - The simplicity of **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** (no halogens, carbonyls, or other substituents) suggests a less negative value than the more complex examples.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.72**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar rigid, aliphatic alcohols without additional polar or aromatic features.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.4286402943482106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The molecule contains a **thiophosphate group (P=S)** and a **phthalimide-like moiety (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**, similar to the molecule:
     ```
     CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, -0.61288383
     ```
   - The main difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a phthalimide group instead of a thioether-linked chloroalkyl group).

2. **Electronic and Functional Group Effects**:
   - The **P=S** group is present in both, contributing similarly to the property.
   - The **phthalimide group** is more polar and conjugated than the **SC(CCl)** group, likely increasing the property value slightly (less negative or more positive).

3. **Trends in the Given Data**:
   - Molecules with **P=S** and aromatic systems tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., -0.61288383 for the similar thiophosphate).
   - The phthalimide group is more electron-withdrawing and polar than the thioether group, which may raise the property value.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The replacement of **SC(CCl)** with the phthalimide group would likely make the property less negative (higher) but still in the same general range. 
   - A reasonable estimate is **-0.55 to -0.45**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the structural similarity and the expected effect of the phthalimide group, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is:

**-0.52**

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.06786718266102858
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitrogens, halogens)** tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.454 for **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**, -0.637 for **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23**).
2. **Aliphatic chains or bulky nonpolar groups** tend to have positive property values (e.g., 2.699 for **CC(C)CC(C)(C)C**, 1.347 for **CCCC(C)(C)C**).
3. **Conjugated systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., C=O, NO₂)** often reduce the property value (e.g., -0.316 for **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2**).
4. **Heterocycles with nitrogen and oxygen** (e.g., pyridines, lactams) tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., -0.734 for **C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54**).

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**:
- The molecule is a **diazole derivative** with:
  - A **carbonyl group (C=O)** (electron-withdrawing, likely reducing the property).
  - Two **nitrogen atoms in the ring** (polar, may contribute to a negative value).
  - **Aromatic rings (benzene and diazole)** (conjugation, likely lowering the value).
  - **Methyl groups (Cc1...n1C)** (small nonpolar substituents, but not enough to outweigh the polar/aromatic effects).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = -0.454): Similar aromatic + carbonyl + nitrogen structure.
- **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.539): Aromatic + carbonyl.
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = -0.150): Less polar (no C=O), so higher than our target.

Given the **carbonyl and two nitrogens**, the property should be more negative than -0.454 but less extreme than -0.734 (highly conjugated polycyclic). 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.55 to -0.65**. Averaging similar examples, I predict:  
**-0.58**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on trends in the given data. If the property is logP, solubility, or another metric, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)  

**Final answer: -0.58**

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9230735489302836
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., multiple -OH, -NH, or -COOH) tend to have higher (more positive) property values (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **2.06995945**).
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., alkanes like `CCCCC`) have lower (more negative) values (e.g., `CCCCC` has a value of **-0.67449076**).
   - Esters (`-COOR`) and carbonyls (`C=O`) tend to have intermediate values, often positive but not as high as alcohols or acids.

2. **Size and Branching**:
   - Larger or more complex molecules with nonpolar regions (e.g., steroids or polycyclic structures) tend to have negative values (e.g., `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has **-0.92928684**).
   - Simple esters or small polar molecules have values closer to zero or slightly positive.

3. **Halogens**:
   - Halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`) have values around **0.2–0.3**, suggesting halogens add slight polarity but not as much as -OH or -NH groups.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is an ester (`-COO-`) with a 6-carbon aliphatic chain (`CCCCCC`) and an ethoxy group (`OCC`).
- Esters in the examples:
  - `CCOC(=O)N` has a value of **0.24261119** (small ester with polar amide).
  - `CC(C)OC(=O)C` has a value of **1.22097018** (branched ester).
  - `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has a value of **0.57787997** (long-chain ester).
- The molecule is similar to `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` but with an ethoxy group (`OCC`) instead of methoxy (`OC`). The ethoxy group is slightly larger but not significantly more polar.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Long-chain esters have values in the range **0.2–1.2**.
- The ethoxy group is not as polar as hydroxyl or amine groups, so the value should be moderate.
- The closest analog is `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (**0.57787997**), but with one fewer carbon and an ethoxy instead of methoxy. This would likely reduce the value slightly.

**Predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC: ~0.45**  
(Estimated range: **0.4–0.6** based on ester examples.)  

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (approximate, based on similar ester examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.2966109515850316
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, we can predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is methyl benzoate, which contains:
   - A phenyl ring (`c1ccccc1`).
   - An ester group (`COC(=O)`).

2. Similar molecules in the dataset:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (property: -0.36372958): This is a diester with a longer alkyl chain, but structurally similar to methyl benzoate.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.05838981): This is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate (just a methyl vs. ethyl group).
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property: -0.90145164): This is a more complex ester, but the core benzoate moiety is present.

3. The ester group (`COC(=O)`) tends to pull the property value toward the slightly negative range (e.g., -0.058 for ethyl benzoate). The phenyl ring alone (e.g., in **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**) gives values around -0.3 to -0.4, but the ester group moderates this.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property of **-0.05838981**, the methyl analog (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) should have a very similar value, possibly slightly more positive due to the shorter alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl). 

### Final Predicted Property:
**-0.05** (approximating to the nearest observed trend). 

However, looking at the exact trend, the value is likely very close to **-0.058**, so we can refine this to:

**Predicted property for COC(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.058** (matching the ethyl benzoate trend). 

But since methyl groups are slightly less lipophilic than ethyl, we might adjust slightly upward (e.g., -0.04 to -0.05). Given the data, the safest prediction is:

**-0.058** (same as ethyl benzoate, as the difference is negligible in this context). 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-0.058** (matching the closest analog, ethyl benzoate). 

However, if we consider that methyl esters are typically slightly less negative than ethyl esters (due to reduced alkyl contribution), we might predict **-0.05**. 

Given the examples, the most justifiable answer is:  
**-0.058** (same as ethyl benzoate, as no strong evidence suggests a significant deviation). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.058** (matching the ethyl benzoate example). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural similarity and trend consistency in the given data.)

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.13144031933793848
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C=C** (ethylene-like fragments) or conjugated systems often have property values in the mid-range (neither highly positive nor highly negative).
   - Example: `C/C=C/C` (butene) has a value of **-0.18414849**.
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene) has a value of **0.70487653**, suggesting that conjugation with an aromatic ring increases the property value.

2. **Saturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - Saturated chains (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CC`) have higher positive values (e.g., **2.5015281**), while cyclic alkanes (e.g., `C1CCCC1`) have negative values (**-0.74558487**).

3. **Conjugated Dienes**:
   - The molecule `C=CCC=C` is a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene). Conjugation typically delocalizes electrons, which may moderately increase the property value compared to isolated double bonds but not as much as aromatic systems.

4. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - `C/C=C/C` (butene, isolated double bond): **-0.18414849**.
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene, conjugated with aromatic): **0.70487653**.
   - `C=CCC=C` (1,3-butadiene) should lie between these, likely closer to butene but slightly higher due to conjugation.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the conjugation in 1,3-butadiene, the property value is expected to be slightly higher than that of butene (`C/C=C/C`) but lower than styrene. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.1** (approximate, based on interpolation between the given examples). 

However, looking more closely, the value for `C/C=C/C` is -0.184, and conjugation typically increases the property modestly. A plausible value for `C=CCC=C` could be around **0.0 to 0.2**. Given the examples, I'll predict:

**Final Prediction: 0.15** (a slight positive value due to conjugation, but not as high as aromatic systems). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polarizability," the reasoning might differ.) 

---

**Answer:** The predicted property value for `C=CCC=C` is approximately **0.15**.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.5634642353926878
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a property value of **0.33049383**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a bromo-chloro-fluoro compound) has a much higher value of **3.96173779**, suggesting that bromine and fluorine contribute significantly to the property.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.23679145**, while **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has the same value, indicating bromine and chlorine may have similar contributions in aromatic systems.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated aliphatic compound, analogous to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but with all hydrogens replaced by bromine.

2. **Electronegativity and Polarizability**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than fluorine but more polarizable. Fully brominated compounds like **BrC(Br)Br** are expected to have high polarizability, which may correlate with higher property values (as seen with **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**).

3. **Aliphatic vs. Aromatic**:
   - Aliphatic brominated compounds (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**) tend to have higher values than aromatic ones (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**). **BrC(Br)Br** is aliphatic, so we expect a higher value.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a value of **3.96173779**. Replacing fluorine and chlorine with bromine (less electronegative but more polarizable) might slightly reduce the property value but keep it relatively high due to the high polarizability of bromine.

### Prediction:
Given the fully brominated nature of **BrC(Br)Br** and its aliphatic structure, the property value is likely high but slightly lower than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** due to the absence of fluorine. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 3.5** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like "molar refractivity" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would align with such trends.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.6128838256179862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.26965954). This group often contributes moderately positive values.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, similar to many examples (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** with property = -0.58878661). Aromaticity alone tends to lower the property slightly.
3. **Chlorine substitution (C(CCl))**: Halogens like Cl can increase the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has property = 2.37989617), but here it's only one Cl.
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: A cyclic amide, similar to **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O** (property = -0.71683232). This tends to lower the property.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: Alkoxy groups are polar but not strongly influential (e.g., **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has property = 1.20030883, but the nitro group dominates there).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines a phosphorothioate (moderate positive contribution), a lactam (negative contribution), and a single Cl (small positive contribution). 
- It is structurally most similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.26965954), but with an additional lactam ring (which would lower the value slightly).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of features, the property is likely slightly positive but lower than 0.26965954 due to the lactam. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: 0.15** (specific value could range between 0.1 and 0.2 based on the competing contributions). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the lactam and aromatic systems tend to pull the value down more significantly, so a more precise estimate might be closer to **0.10**. 

For a single definitive answer, I would predict:  
**0.12** (a compromise between the phosphorothioate's positive effect and the lactam's negative effect). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.5167574671870242
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** by analyzing structural features and trends in the dataset.

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Highly polar or charged groups (e.g., N, O, S, halogens)** tend to influence the property significantly:
   - **Cl-containing molecules** often have negative values (e.g., `ClCCCCl` = -0.674, `ClCCBr` = -0.804), but some with multiple Cl (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) have very high positive values (11.426).
   - **N-containing groups** (amines, amides, nitro) vary widely:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)C` = 1.869 (amide + dimethylamine)
     - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` = 5.129 (bis-amide)
     - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` = 0.462 (aromatic amine)
   - **Aromatic systems with substitutions** (e.g., NO₂, Cl) often have values around 0.5–1.0 (e.g., `Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` = 0.990).

2. **Steric bulk and branching**:
   - Bulky groups (e.g., tert-butyl, polycyclic systems) often lead to negative values (e.g., `C(C)(C)C` in `CC=C(C)C` = 1.296, but complex cases vary).

3. **Combined functional groups**:
   - Molecules with **amide + aromatic + halogen** (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` = -0.093) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - The presence of **multiple polar groups** (e.g., amide + nitro + Cl) can lead to additive effects.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** has:
- A **tertiary amide** (`CN(C)C(=O)N-`) similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (value = 5.129), but here it’s part of a more complex structure.
- A **chlorinated aromatic ring** (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`), which often reduces the property (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = 0.746).
- A **heterocyclic group** (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) with a carbonyl, which may contribute negatively (similar to `Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` = 0.537).
- A **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`), which can add steric bulk (often negative influence, but not always).

### Prediction:
Given the **amide + Cl + heterocycle + bulky group** combination, the molecule likely has a **moderate positive value**, but less extreme than `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (5.129). The Cl and heterocycle may pull the value down slightly, while the amide and bulky group could elevate it. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.5 to 2.5**  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**1.872** (similar in magnitude to `CN(C)C(=O)C` = 1.869, but slightly adjusted for the additional groups).

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.5742463235316096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core**: The molecule contains two phenol groups (hydroxyl-substituted benzene rings), which are connected via an ether linkage (O). Phenol derivatives in the examples (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` with a value of **1.4278277**) tend to have positive property values, especially when halogenated.
2. **Chlorine substitution**: There are three chlorine atoms (two on one ring and one on the other). Chlorine substitution generally increases the property value, as seen in:
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.4278277)
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (3.20726863, with more Cl substitutions).
3. **Symmetry and conjugation**: The molecule is symmetric with extended conjugation due to the ether linkage, which may stabilize the structure and influence the property.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.4278277), but our molecule has an additional phenol ring and one more Cl. This would likely increase the property value further.
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (3.20726863) has more Cl substitutions but lacks the second phenol ring. Our molecule has fewer Cl atoms but more aromatic hydroxyl groups, which could balance the effect.

### Prediction:
Given the additional phenol ring and Cl substitution compared to `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`, but fewer Cl atoms than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, a reasonable estimate would be **between 1.4 and 3.2**. Splitting the difference and considering the additive effects, I predict:

**Predicted property value: ~2.5**  
(Plausible range: 2.3 to 2.7, given the structural features.)  

### Final Answer:
**2.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples).

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.1841484878797341
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`CC/C=C\C`  
This is **2-pentene** (specifically, the trans isomer due to the `\` and `/` notation), a simple alkene with a double bond and no significant polar functional groups.

**Similar examples from the data:**  
1. `CC/C=C/C` (property: **-0.18414849**) – This is another pentene isomer (likely cis or trans).  
2. `CCCC(=O)OC` (property: **0.74402761**) – This is an ester, more polar due to the carbonyl group.  
3. `CCCCCC` (not explicitly listed, but longer alkanes like `CCCCCCCCCC...` have values around **0.56286583**).  

The presence of the double bond in `CC/C=C\C` introduces slight polarity (but less than an ester or alcohol) and reduces hydrophobicity compared to alkanes. The value for `CC/C=C/C` is **-0.18414849**, and since stereochemistry (cis/trans) doesn't drastically affect this property (assuming it's a bulk property like logP or solubility), the value for `CC/C=C\C` should be very close.  

**Predicted property for `CC/C=C\C`:**  
**-0.18** (approximately the same as `CC/C=C/C`).  

For higher precision, I'd estimate:  
**-0.184** (same as the closely related isomer).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-0.184** (matching the given example of `CC/C=C/C`).
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.548812566481886
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkyl Groups**: 
   - **C** (methane): -1.05390349  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -0.39748692  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.44882276  
   These suggest that small hydrocarbons tend to have negative values, with slight increases as size increases.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.56346424  
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): 0.91443482  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): 0.75756576  
   Oxygenated compounds (ethers, alcohols, esters) tend to have higher (less negative) values than pure hydrocarbons, especially if they contain multiple oxygen atoms or aromatic rings.

3. **Ethers Specifically**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: -0.89707924 (complex ether with aromaticity)  
   - **COc1ccccc1O**: 0.75756576 (aromatic ether)  
   Simple aliphatic ethers are not directly listed, but **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (with an ether-like fragment) has a positive value (0.91443482).

4. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer chains or branching (e.g., **CC(C)O** vs. **C**) reduce the negativity of the property.  
   - **CCCOCC** is a linear ether with 5 carbons and an oxygen, similar in simplicity to **CC(C)O** but with a slightly larger structure.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- It is a simple aliphatic ether, structurally similar to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) but with an ether linkage instead of a hydroxyl group. Ethers typically have less polar character than alcohols, but the oxygen still contributes to a higher (less negative) value than pure hydrocarbons.  
- Given that **CC(C)O** has a value of -0.56346424 and **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (with an ester/ether) has 0.91443482, a simple ether like **CCCOCC** would likely fall between these, closer to the alcohol but slightly higher due to the ether linkage.  
- No exact match exists, but **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol) has a value of 0.06511279, which is a reasonable proxy for a 5-carbon oxygenated molecule.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, **CCCOCC** would likely have a property value slightly higher than **CC(C)O** but lower than more complex oxygenated compounds. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~0.1 to 0.3**.  

However, reviewing the examples again, **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, 5 carbons + OH) is 0.06511279, and **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (ester/ether) is 0.91443482. Since **CCCOCC** is simpler than the ester but more oxygenated than a pure hydrocarbon, splitting the difference suggests:  
**Predicted value: ~0.2**.

But given the lack of exact matches, a conservative estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.06511279** (same as **CCC(O)CC**, as both are 5-carbon oxygenated chains).  

However, ethers are less polar than alcohols, so the value might be slightly lower. Adjusting downward:  
**Final predicted value: -0.1**.  

Given the uncertainty, the closest reasonable guess is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.0**.  

But to align with the examples more precisely, I'll select the closest analog (**CCC(O)CC** = 0.06511279) and round:  
**Predicted property value: 0.07**.  

However, this is still approximate. Given the data variability, the safest answer is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.0**.  

But reviewing the examples again, **CCCCCCC=C** (a 7-carbon alkene) is -0.19428149, and **CCCOCC** is smaller and oxygenated, so it should be higher. Thus, a better estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.2**.  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCOCC: 0.2**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.7262641609267014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which contribute hydrophobicity and aromatic stacking interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to one of the phenyl rings adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.8124599): This is a simple diphenylmethane derivative with no polar groups. The property is negative due to high hydrophobicity.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property: -0.92117665): This has a tertiary amide and two aromatic rings (one with a heterocycle). The property is more negative due to the polar amide and additional aromaticity.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property: -0.92023243): This has a tertiary amide and a complex aliphatic ring system. The property is similarly negative due to the amide and hydrophobic rings.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the **amide group** tends to reduce the property value (make it more negative) compared to purely hydrophobic molecules like diphenylmethane.
   - The **tert-butyl group** adds hydrophobicity, but the amide's polarity counteracts this.
   - The molecule lacks strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., NO2, OH, COOH) that would significantly increase the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property: -0.92117665) and **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property: -0.92023243), but with slightly less polarity (no heterocycle or aliphatic rings), the property value should be slightly less negative. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.85** (rounded to two decimal places).

### Justification:
- The amide group and two phenyl rings suggest a value close to -0.92, but the tert-butyl group's hydrophobicity offsets this slightly.
- The absence of additional polar groups (like in NO2 or OH-containing molecules) prevents the value from being positive.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**-0.85**.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.027506178635524254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituents and Functional Groups**:
   - **Bromine (Br)**: Molecules with Br substituents tend to have positive property values. For example:
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 1.02070765
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 0.8493949
     - `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`: 1.4278277
   - **Amide (N-C=O)**: Amide groups (like in `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) often appear in molecules with moderately negative to slightly positive property values. For example:
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.72626416
     - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`: -0.54431139
   - **Aromatic Rings**: Phenyl rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Br, NO2) tend to increase the property value, while electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH2) may decrease or moderately increase it.

2. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has:
     - An amide group (`CC(=O)N-`), which may slightly decrease the property value.
     - A bromine substituent on the phenyl ring, which tends to increase the property value.
     - No strongly electron-donating groups (like OH or NH2) to counteract the Br effect.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = 0.8493949): Br on phenyl with an OH group.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (property = 0.8493949): NH2 on phenyl (similar electron-donating effect as OH).
   - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (property = -0.72626416): Amide with bulky substituents.

### Prediction:
The amide group (`CC(=O)N-`) will slightly reduce the property value compared to a simple Br-substituted phenyl ring, but the Br will still contribute a positive effect. A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.8493949) but higher than amide-containing molecules with no Br (e.g., -0.54431139).

**Predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: ~0.45**  
(Estimated range: 0.4 to 0.6, balancing the opposing effects of Br and the amide group.)  

### Refined Estimate:
Given the examples, a precise interpolation suggests a value close to **0.45**. This aligns with:
- Br increasing the value (e.g., +0.8 to +1.4 in other cases).
- Amide slightly reducing it (e.g., -0.5 to -0.7 in other cases).
- The net effect is a compromise between these trends.

**Final answer: 0.45**

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2407151661854323
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Benzene Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Property value = **1.25968537**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): Property value = **0.37328957**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): Property value = **0.40693267**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property value = **0.70487653**
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetonitrile): Property value = **0.91184937**
   - **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene): Property value = **0.80992282**

   The property values for benzene derivatives with small alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) range from **0.37 to 1.26**, with toluene being the highest. Larger or branched alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl) tend to reduce the property value slightly compared to methyl.

2. **Isobutyl Group**:
   - The isobutyl group (**CC(C)C-**) is bulkier than methyl or ethyl but less polar than groups like nitrile or bromo. From the examples:
     - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): Property value = **-0.31179036**
     - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutyl alcohol derivative): Property value = **-0.1761233**
     - **CC(C)CCCO** (branched alkyl chain): Property value = **-0.08607945**

   The isobutyl group tends to correlate with lower (often negative) property values when not attached to an aromatic ring. However, when attached to a benzene ring, the effect is less clear.

3. **Combined Effect**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an isobutyl group attached to a benzene ring. Comparing to similar structures:
     - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **0.37328957**
     - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): **0.40693267**
     - The isobutyl group is bulkier than ethyl or isopropyl but similar in polarity. We might expect a slightly lower value than isopropyltoluene due to increased sterics.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely slightly lower than that of isopropyltoluene (**0.40693267**) but higher than ethyltoluene (**0.37328957**). A reasonable estimate would be around **0.38 to 0.40**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1: 0.39** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures).
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.7048765283543004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): 1.34078714  
     (Polar groups like amide and hydroxyl increase the value.)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups): 1.92242659  
     (Strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups increase the value further.)
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxy group): 0.24466459  
     (Less polar than hydroxyl/nitro, so lower value.)

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (cyclic ketone): -0.04827577  
     (Aliphatic ketone has a low value.)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide with two aromatic rings): -0.64386567  
     (Despite aromatic rings, the imide structure lowers the value.)

3. **Benzaldehyde-like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol) but lacks the hydroxyl group and has an aldehyde instead of an amide. Aldehydes are less polar than amides but more polar than simple aromatic hydrocarbons.

### Comparison:
- **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not in the dataset, but simpler aromatics like **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12** (naphthalene derivative) have values ~0.55.  
- **O=Cc1ccccc1** adds a polar aldehyde group, which should increase the value compared to plain toluene but likely less than the amide or nitro examples.

### Predicted Value:
Given the trends:
- The aldehyde group is less polar than an amide or nitro group but more polar than a methoxy group.  
- A reasonable estimate would be between **0.5 and 1.5**, closer to the lower end because the aldehyde is not as strongly polarizing as nitro or amide groups.

From similar examples:
- **COc1ccccc1** (methoxy): 0.244  
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): 1.340  

For **O=Cc1ccccc1**, I predict a value slightly higher than methoxy but lower than amide/phenol:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85** (approximate, likely in the range 0.7–1.0).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on polarity/electron-withdrawing effects.)  

**Final answer: 0.85**

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.7532831559716892
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like core** (O=C2CN(N=...)C(=O)N2), which is a rigid, polar, and hydrogen-bonding motif. Similar heterocycles in the examples (e.g., pyrimidines, imidazoles) often have property values in the **mid-range** (e.g., `0.48469682` for `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`).
2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: This strongly electron-withdrawing group appears in the provided examples with mixed effects:
   - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of **-0.66331771**.
   - `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (no nitro group but similar heterocycle) has **0.58694124**.
   The nitro group here is conjugated with an aromatic ring, likely reducing its impact compared to aliphatic nitro compounds.
3. **Aromatic System**: The **benzofuran-like** fragment (`c1ccc(o1)`) is polar and conjugated, similar to examples like `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (**0.48469682**).
4. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule is highly polar due to multiple H-bond acceptors (carbonyls, nitro) and donors (NH). Polar molecules in the examples span a wide range, but rigid heterocycles tend toward **moderate positive values**.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** (heterocycle + carbonyl + halogen): **0.48469682**  
- **c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2** (fused heterocycle): **0.58694124**  
- **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (nitro + ether + halogen): **-0.66331771**  

The given molecule combines features of the first two (heterocycle + nitro) but lacks halogens, which often lower the property value. The rigid, conjugated system with nitro and carbonyl groups suggests a **positive value**, likely between **0.4 and 0.6**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.52**  
*(Rationale: Mid-range positive value due to polar heterocycle and nitro group, offset by rigidity and lack of halogens.)*  

This estimate aligns with the trend observed for similar conjugated, polar heterocycles in the provided data.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.8124598972897291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (given in the examples), with the key difference being the central nitrogen linkage. The given molecule has a single bond between the nitrogens (`N-N`), while the example has a double bond (`N=N`). 

   - Example: `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a property value of **-0.69672991**.

2. **Impact of Nitrogen Bonding**: 
   - Single-bonded nitrogen (`N-N`) tends to be less polarizable or less electron-withdrawing than double-bonded nitrogen (`N=N`), which could lead to a slightly higher (less negative) property value.
   - The presence of two phenyl rings (aromatic systems) attached to the nitrogen centers is consistent in both molecules, suggesting similar contributions from the aromatic systems.

3. **Trend in Aromatic Nitrogen Compounds**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has a property value of **0.80992282**.
   - The addition of another phenyl ring (as in `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) would likely reduce the property value due to increased sterics and delocalization, but not as drastically as the `N=N` case.

4. **Adjustment for Single vs. Double Bond**:
   - The `N=N` linkage in the example introduces more rigidity and electron withdrawal, leading to a more negative value (-0.696). 
   - Replacing `N=N` with `N-N` would reduce this effect, likely resulting in a less negative value (closer to zero).

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be slightly higher (less negative) than the `N=N` analog. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.4 to -0.5**. 

For specificity, we can interpolate between the `N=N` case (-0.696) and simpler aromatic amines (e.g., aniline at 0.809). Splitting the difference suggests a value around **-0.55 to -0.60**, but accounting for the single bond's reduced impact, we lean toward **-0.45**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on structural analogy and trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data's trends.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.5781617603467847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two amide groups (**NC=O**), one of which is part of a cyclic structure (imide-like).
   - A cyclopentane ring (**CCCC1**) fused to the imide.
   - The molecule is a cyclic diamide (similar to a succinimide derivative but with a cyclopentane ring).

2. **Polarity/Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and can act as hydrogen bond acceptors/donors.
   - The cyclopentane ring adds hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar amides.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.89931429): This is a similar cyclic diamide with additional alkyl chains. The property is moderately positive.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (not in the list, but simpler imides like succinimide would likely have properties around 0 to -1 based on other polar cyclic amides).
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -0.54431139): A cyclic diamide with less hydrophobic character than our target molecule.

4. **Key Differences**:
   - Our molecule has a cyclopentane ring, which is less bulky than the alkyl chains in the first example but more hydrophobic than the second example.
   - The symmetry and lack of additional polar groups (like nitro or halogens) suggest a property between the two examples above.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar amides and the hydrophobic cyclopentane ring, the property value is likely **slightly positive but close to zero**. Comparing to the most similar examples:
- The first example (with bulky alkyl chains) has a higher value (~0.899).
- The second example (less hydrophobic) has a lower value (~-0.544).

A reasonable interpolation for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** would be around **0.2 to 0.4**. 

However, the cyclopentane ring is less hydrophobic than the alkyl chains in the first example, so the value might be closer to **0.0**. 

Given the examples, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.24567431154231073
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **1.25968537**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **-0.39926918**.
   - The presence of chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, but the effect diminishes or reverses with excessive chlorination or bulky substituents.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked by a single bond, with chlorine substituents). 
   - It is more chlorinated than dichlorobenzene but less chlorinated than the heavily substituted example above. The symmetry and moderate chlorination suggest a property value between these two examples.

3. **Biphenyl Systems**:
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-0.73025481**, but this is a fused ring system, not directly comparable.
   - The biphenyl core with chlorination likely increases the property value compared to non-chlorinated or fused systems.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Dichlorobenzene has a value of **1.25968537**.
- A heavily chlorinated biphenyl has a value of **-0.39926918**.
- The target molecule is a **moderately chlorinated biphenyl** (three chlorine atoms, symmetrically distributed), its property value is likely **between these two values but closer to the dichlorobenzene value** due to the aromatic chlorination effect.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than dichlorobenzene but higher than the heavily chlorinated case. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.85** (approximate, based on interpolation from the given examples). 

For higher precision, I would note that the value is likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.0**, similar to other moderately chlorinated aromatics like **Cc1ccccc1N (1.25968537)** or **Clc1ccccc1Cl (1.25968537)** but slightly reduced due to the biphenyl linkage. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.92** (refined estimate). 

However, comparing more closely to the heavily chlorinated biphenyl example (-0.399), the target molecule's additional chlorine and biphenyl structure may push it toward a lower value than dichlorobenzene but not as low as -0.399. A compromise is **0.65**.

Given the uncertainty, the most defensible prediction based on the examples is:  
**0.75** (averaging the trends). 

But to match the closest structural analog (dichlorobenzene), I'll stick with:  
**1.0** (rounded from dichlorobenzene's 1.26, accounting for biphenyl linkage). 

After reconsidering, the biphenyl linkage likely reduces the value slightly, so:  
**0.85**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is **0.85**.
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.16108204974988416
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): Property = 1.25968537
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = -0.69779531
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): Property = 0.70487653
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): Property = 0.24466459

   Aromatic rings with small alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) tend to have positive property values (~0.2 to 1.3), while longer alkyl chains (e.g., hexyl) reduce the property value (negative).

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a benzene ring with two ethyl groups (symmetrically substituted). 
   - Compared to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene, property = -0.69779531), diethylbenzene has shorter alkyl chains, so the property value should be higher (less negative or positive).
   - Compared to **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine, property = 0.24466459), diethylbenzene lacks the polar nitrogen but has two ethyl groups instead of one, which may balance out the effect.

3. **Polar vs. Non-Polar Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., NO₂, OH, C=O) tend to increase the property value (e.g., **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O** = 2.98577294).
   - Non-polar alkyl groups reduce the property value but not as drastically as long hydrophobic chains.

### Prediction:
Given that diethylbenzene is a non-polar molecule with two short alkyl chains, its property value should be slightly positive but lower than mono-substituted alkylbenzenes like methylaniline (1.259) or benzaldehyde (0.704). 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.2**, similar to **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine, 0.24466459), but adjusted slightly lower due to the lack of a polar nitrogen.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.15** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 1.5730001728852196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, similar to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.74680771) and **Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O** (property = -0.77293739).  
2. **Substituent**: It has a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)** attached to the benzene ring. This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group, analogous to the **nitro (N(=O)=O)** group in **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.74680771).  
3. **Polarity**: The sulfonamide is more polar than a nitro group but less polar than highly halogenated/aliphatic structures (e.g., **ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**, property = 45.10381203).  

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = **0.74680771** (nitro-substituted aniline).  
- **Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O**: Property = **-0.77293739** (heterocyclic, less polar).  
- **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: Property = **2.40146285** (dinitro-substituted toluene, more electron-withdrawing).  

The sulfonamide group in **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is less electron-withdrawing than two nitro groups but more polar than a single nitro group. Thus, its property value should be **higher than 0.74680771** but **lower than 2.40146285**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between polarity and substitution, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property = 1.25** (interpolated between the nitro-aniline and dinitro-toluene examples).  

### Final Answer:
**1.25**

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.5735455055119025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's a bent or angular arrangement). The structure can be broken down as:
- A central naphthalene-like core (two fused benzene rings).
- Two additional benzene rings fused to the core, creating a more extended conjugated system.

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**, **Cc1ccc(O)cc1**) have property values around **0.2–0.8**.
   - Larger fused aromatic systems (e.g., **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**, **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**) have **negative values** (around **-0.5 to -0.7**). These systems are more conjugated and rigid.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO2) tend to lower the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH3, OH) tend to increase it.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**: Property = **-0.53337817** (4 fused rings, similar to our molecule but with a methyl group).
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**: Property = **-0.72253198** (5 fused rings, more extended conjugation).
   - **c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32**: Property = **-0.21288574** (3 fused rings, less conjugation).

### Prediction:
Our molecule (**c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**) has:
- **4 fused benzene rings**, similar to the first example above but without substituents.
- Extended conjugation but less than the 5-ring example.
- No electron-donating or withdrawing groups.

Given the trends:
- Larger fused systems have lower (more negative) values.
- The absence of substituents suggests a value closer to the pure hydrocarbon examples.

Comparing to **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (-0.533) and **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (-0.723), our molecule is intermediate in size. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.65** (approximately midway between -0.53 and -0.72 for similar structures). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is:
**-0.65** (estimated range: -0.60 to -0.70). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural similarity and trends in the given data.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.7844344658507247
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This molecule has the following features:
1. Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), which are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (tends to lower the property value, as seen in similar molecules like `Oc1cccc(O)c1` with a value of 1.02070765 or `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with -0.16395495).
2. Aromatic rings (contributing to stability but may not drastically change the property unless heavily substituted).
3. A carbonyl group (C=O), which adds polarity but is less impactful than -OH groups.
4. No halogens (Cl, Br, I, F), which in the examples sometimes increase the property value (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has 0.81793854, `Fc1ccccc1` has 0.80992282).
5. Moderate size and branching, but not excessively large or hydrophobic.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (two -OH groups, small aromatic) has a value of **1.02070765**.
- `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (multiple -OH groups, aliphatic) has a value of **-0.16395495**.
- `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (multiple -OH, aromatic, carbonyl) has a value of **-0.77572969**.

This molecule has **four -OH groups**, an aromatic system, and a carbonyl group, placing it in a similar range to the last example but with slightly more polarity due to the additional -OH groups. Thus, the property value is likely slightly lower (more negative) than -0.77572969 but not as extreme as very large or halogenated molecules.

### Predicted property value: **-0.85** (approximate, likely between -0.80 and -0.90). 

For specificity, I'll predict: **-0.87**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 12.768741241634693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/phosphorothioate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **moderate to high positive values** (e.g., 0.966, 1.541).
   - The presence of **P=O** (as in `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) gives a higher value (1.5409) compared to P=S.

2. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - Molecules like `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` have a **moderate positive value (0.673)**.
   - The combination of **P=O and NC=O** (as in the target molecule) is not explicitly present in the examples, but both fragments individually contribute positively.

3. **Thioether (S-C)**:
   - The presence of sulfur (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) can increase the property value (1.982), but this depends on the context.

4. **Steric and electronic effects**:
   - Bulky or highly substituted groups (e.g., `CCC(C)(O)CC`) can lead to higher values (2.502).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) often reduce the value unless balanced by other strong contributors.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** linked to methoxy (CO) and thioether (SC).
- An **amide (NC(C)=O)** attached to phosphorus.
- No aromaticity or halogens, but the **P=O and NC=O** are strong contributors.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.5409): Has P=O and aromatic Cl, but the target lacks Cl and has NC=O instead of OC.
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (0.673): Only NC=O, but the target has additional P=O and SC.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.966): P=S is less contributing than P=O.

### Predicted Value:
Given the **P=O and NC=O** combination (both positive contributors) and the absence of reducing factors (e.g., halogens), the value should be **higher than 1.0 but less than 2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity and additive contributions). 

(Note: Without a clear linear trend or model, this is an educated guess. The actual value could vary slightly depending on unaccounted interactions.)

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.29793485571623635
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Halogenated compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a property value of **0.06429327**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a higher value of **1.4278277**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a value of **0.8493949**.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroacetanilide) has a much lower value of **0.02750618**.

2. **Alkenes**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.24261119**.
   - **CCC=O** (aldehyde) has a negative value of **-0.58825876**.

3. **Dichloro compounds**:
   - The presence of two chlorines tends to give moderate values unless paired with strongly polar or functionalized groups (e.g., phenol or aniline).

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- This is a simple dichloroalkene with no additional functional groups. 
- Compared to **CCCC(=C)C** (0.24261119), the chlorines add some polarity but not as much as in aromatic systems like chloroaniline or dichlorophenol.
- The value is likely to be **positive but low**, similar to other non-aromatic halogenated compounds in the dataset.

### Final predicted value:
**0.15** (estimated based on trends; actual value would likely fall between 0.0 and 0.3). 

*(Note: Without a clear definition of the property or more examples of simple halogenated alkenes, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity.)*

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.7351667138627583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Contains a pyridine-like nitrogen in the context of a larger aromatic system. Property: **-0.78688209**.
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: A fused aromatic system with multiple nitrogens. Property: **-0.09393541**.
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: A nitrogen-containing aromatic system. Property: **-0.20405599**.
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**: A fused aromatic system with multiple nitrogens. Property: **0.46202816**.

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: Aniline derivative (aromatic + nitrogen). Property: **0.24466459**.
   - **CCNc1ccccc1**: Similar to above but with an ethyl group. Property: **-0.1965707**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (no heteroatoms). Property: **-0.55838001**.

3. **Pyridine vs. Benzene**:
   - Pyridine (c1ccncc1) is analogous to benzene but with a nitrogen replacing one CH group. Nitrogen introduces polarity and lone pair effects, which may lower the property value compared to benzene-like systems.

### Key Trends:
- Nitrogen in aromatic rings tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene derivatives without heteroatoms often have higher values).
- Fused aromatic systems with nitrogens can have variable values, but simple pyridine-like structures tend to be in the mid-to-low range.

### Prediction for c1ccncc1 (Pyridine):
- Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CNc1ccccc1** (aniline derivative): **0.24466459**.
  - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: **-0.20405599**.
  - Pyridine is simpler than these and lacks additional substituents or fused rings. Its property value is likely between these two, closer to the lower end due to the nitrogen's effect.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** is approximately **-0.15**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.8449419291682703
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **OCC(O)CO-**: A polyol-like fragment (similar to sugars, e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO with a high value of 10.617, but shorter here).
   - **OC(=O)c1ccccc1**: An ester-linked phenyl group (similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC with 0.727).
   - **Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**: A chlorinated heteroaromatic system with an amine linker (similar to Cl-substituted aromatics like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 with 0.849 or Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl with 0.108).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule combines polar (hydroxy, ester, amine) and aromatic/heteroaromatic components.
   - Chlorine substitution tends to increase the property (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1: 0.849; Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl: 3.207).
   - Polyols can drastically increase the property (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO: 10.617), but this fragment is smaller here.
   - The ester and aromatic amine linker may moderate the value (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC: 0.727; O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2: -0.815).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analogs are likely combinations of the ester-linked phenyl (moderate positive contribution) and the chlorinated heteroaromatic (positive contribution). The polyol fragment is small but may add slightly.

### Estimated Property:
Given the balance of polar, aromatic, and halogenated features, the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to other chlorinated or ester-containing aromatics. 

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on the examples, likely between 0.1 and 0.8 due to competing contributions from the polar and aromatic components.)*

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.548812566481886
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity vs. Hydrophilicity**:
   - Molecules with long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, **CCCCCCCI**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.1 to -0.3), suggesting hydrophobicity.
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-O-**, **-N=O**) tend to have higher (less negative or positive) values. For example:
     - **CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol analog) has a very high value (2.69970465).
     - **Oc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthol) has a positive value (0.46202816).
     - **COC=O** (methyl formate) has a moderately negative value (-0.58825876).

2. **Chain Length and Functional Groups**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains with no polar groups (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**) have negative values.
   - Introducing polar groups (e.g., **-OH**) increases the property value. For example:
     - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a value of -0.7198157, which is less negative than pure hydrocarbons but still negative due to the large hydrophobic cycloalkane portion.
     - **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) has a shorter chain and a polar **-OH**, so its value should be less negative than **OC1CCCCCCC1**.

3. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.1965707 (hydrophobic).
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.7198157 (large hydrophobic portion dominates).
   - **CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O**: 2.69970465 (highly branched alcohol, very polar).
   - **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol with a moderate balance of hydrophobic (pentyl) and hydrophilic (**-OH**) character.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
Given the trends:
- The **-OH** group will increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
- The pentyl chain is shorter than the cycloheptane in **OC1CCCCCCC1**, so the hydrophobic effect is less dominant.
- Linear alcohols like 1-pentanol are less polar than branched alcohols like **CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O**, so the value will be much lower than 2.69970465.

A reasonable estimate is **slightly negative but closer to zero** than **OC1CCCCCCC1**. From the examples, **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) is -0.48420719, and **CCCCCO** is somewhat similar but less polar.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is **-0.35**. 

This balances the hydrophobic pentyl chain and the polar **-OH** group, placing it between **CCCc1ccccc1** (-0.1965707) and **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-0.7198157).

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.598369722937809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with moderate property values (e.g., 0.359 for Sc2nc1ccccc1s2, 0.161 for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1).
2. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Polar and electronegative, likely increasing the property value (similar to phosphoryl groups in some examples, e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with 0.189).
3. **Lactam-like structure (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (0.760) and O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (-0.644), suggesting a moderate influence.
4. **Heterocycle (CCO1)**: The oxygen in the ring may slightly decrease the property value (similar to ethers like CCCOC with -0.674, but less extreme here due to other polar groups).
5. **No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, CN) or highly hydrophobic chains**: The property is unlikely to be very high or very low.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** (property = 0.912), which has a phosphoryl group, aromatic ring, and ester, but our molecule has a sulfonyl group instead and lacks the ester. This suggests a slightly lower value.
- Another similar example is **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (property = -0.644), but our molecule has additional polar groups (sulfonyl, ether) that may raise the value.

### Predicted property:
Considering the balance of polar (sulfonyl, lactam) and moderately hydrophobic (aromatic ring, alkyl) groups, the property value is likely in the **moderate positive range**, similar to molecules with sulfonyl or phosphoryl groups paired with aromatic systems. 

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on the examples, likely between 0.3 and 0.6.)*

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.17564763629700475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: From the examples, molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) tend to have positive property values (~0.746). The nitro group is electron-withdrawing but can contribute to polarity or other properties.
2. **Ester groups (COC(=O))**: Esters (e.g., `CC(=O)OC`) are polar and can influence the property. In the examples, esters often appear with moderately positive values (~0.696).
3. **Fused ring system**: The molecule has a fused aromatic/heterocyclic system (benzene + nitrogen-containing ring). Fused rings like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` have negative values, but simpler fused systems (e.g., `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2`) can have positive values (~0.162).
4. **Substituted aromatic ring**: The benzene ring is substituted with a nitro group, which is similar to `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (~0.746) or `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (~0.462).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The nitro group and ester functionalities suggest a positive contribution.
- The fused ring system may slightly reduce the value compared to simpler nitroaromatics.
- The molecule is more complex than most examples, but the nitro and ester groups dominate the prediction.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.75** (specific: 0.75000000)

This aligns with the trends observed for nitroaromatics and esters in the examples.

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.589757521769719
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as both hydrogen bond acceptors and donors).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests moderate to high polarity.
3. **Size and Complexity**: It is a small, rigid bicyclic system (5-membered ring fused to a 3-membered ring), which may reduce flexibility and influence solubility or other properties.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (e.g., amides, alcohols) tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., **0.69668288** for **CCCOC(=O)CC**, which has an ester).
- Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **c1ccncc1**, a pyridine with value **0.73516671**) often have positive but not extreme values.
- Rigid bicyclic systems (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O**, with value **-0.90495733**) tend to have negative values, but this is a larger, more complex molecule.

Given the small size, polarity, and rigidity of **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, it is likely to have a property value in the **low to mid-positive range**. A reasonable estimate would be close to other small polar cyclic molecules like **c1ccncc1 (0.73516671)** but slightly lower due to the additional rigidity of the cyclopropane ring.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (approximate, based on structural analogy and trends in the examples). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.*

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.9263596343631936
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.67449076
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.5634068
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.71966845
   - **C1CCC=CCC1** (cycloheptene): -0.66536027
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.39748692 (contains a nitrile group, which is polar and likely increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons).

   Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, with slight variations based on branching or unsaturation.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics and Aliphatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): 0.80992282
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene): 1.25968537
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene): 2.37989617
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (a highly chlorinated polycyclic): -0.77461817

   Chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive property values, with the value increasing as the number of chlorine atoms increases. However, highly chlorinated polycyclic structures may deviate due to steric or electronic effects.

3. **Chlorinated Aliphatics**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is not explicitly in the examples, but we can compare it to similar small halogenated alkanes or fragments:
     - The presence of chlorine in an aliphatic chain (compared to pure hydrocarbons) likely increases the property value, but not as much as in aromatic systems (where resonance effects can play a role).

4. **Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.39748692 (polar group, but still negative).
   - **Oc1ccncc1** (hydroxypyridine): 0.80992282 (heterocyclic with oxygen, similar to chlorobenzene).

### Prediction for ClCC:
- Chloroethane is a simple chlorinated alkane. Compared to pure alkanes (which have negative values), the addition of a chlorine atom will likely increase the property value, but not as much as in aromatic systems. 
- Given that **CC#N** (acetonitrile, a polar molecule) has a value of -0.39748692, and **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has 0.80992282, chloroethane (less polar than acetonitrile and less conjugated than chlorobenzene) might have a value between these two, closer to the alkane values but slightly higher due to the chlorine.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable estimate for **ClCC** would be slightly higher than simple alkanes but lower than chlorinated aromatics. Based on the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCC: ~0.2 to 0.5**

Given the trends, a specific estimate could be **0.35**. 

However, looking at the examples more closely, **c1ccoc1** (furan, a heterocyclic) has a value of 1.21661001, and **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has 0.80992282. Since chloroethane is less conjugated, a value lower than chlorobenzene but higher than alkanes seems plausible. 

A more precise estimate might be **0.25**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for ClCC: 0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.9516467848721242
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl**, **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...**) tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.3 to -0.7. 
   - The presence of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichloromethyl group) is seen in **ClC(Cl)Cl** (-0.31179036) and **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (-0.39926918), suggesting a contribution toward negative values.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - Pyridine-like structures (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**, which includes a nitrogen in the ring) have moderately positive values (e.g., 0.58694124). 
   - The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** contains a **chloropyridine** core (nitrogen in the ring) with additional chlorines, which may counteract the positive effect of the nitrogen.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The trichloromethyl group (**C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) is strongly electron-withdrawing and likely dominates over the nitrogen's influence, pushing the property value toward the negative range.
   - Comparing to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (-0.39926918), which has a similar trichloromethyl group but a biphenyl system, our molecule has a smaller aromatic system (pyridine vs. benzene), which may slightly reduce the magnitude of the negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the trichloromethyl group and the presence of a chloropyridine ring, the property value is expected to be **negative but less extreme** than highly chlorinated aliphatics (e.g., -0.3 to -0.5 range). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (similar to **ClC(Cl)Cl** but adjusted for the aromatic nitrogen influence).

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**).

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.08607944873202328
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Alcohol Functional Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with an -OH group tend to have property values in the range of **~0.2 to ~0.8** (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC` = 0.4808, `CC(O)c1ccccc1` = 0.2853, `CCC(C)CCO` = 0.2440, `CCC(CC)CO` = 0.7091).
   - The position and branching of the -OH group influence the value. For example, `CCC(CC)CO` (linear terminal -OH) has a higher value (0.7091) than `CCC(C)CCO` (branched terminal -OH, 0.2440).

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer/branched aliphatic chains tend to slightly lower the property value compared to simpler alcohols (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC` = 0.4808 vs. `CC(O)c1ccccc1` = 0.2853).
   - The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (5-carbon chain with -OH on a secondary carbon), similar to `CCC(C)CCO` (branched 4-carbon chain with terminal -OH, value = 0.2440) but with an extra carbon.

3. **Comparison to Closest Examples**:
   - `CCC(C)CCO` (4-carbon branched, terminal -OH): **0.2440**
   - `CCC(CC)CO` (5-carbon linear, terminal -OH): **0.7091**
   - `CCCC(O)CCC` (7-carbon, -OH internal): **0.4808**
   - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (benzyl alcohol): **0.2853**

   The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is a 5-carbon branched alcohol with -OH on a secondary carbon. This is structurally between `CCC(C)CCO` and `CCC(CC)CO`. Since branching tends to lower the value compared to linear chains, I expect it to be closer to `CCC(C)CCO` (0.2440) but slightly higher due to the longer chain.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCC(C)O** is **~0.35**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O: 0.35** (approximate, based on structural trends in the given data). 

This aligns with the observation that branched alcohols with -OH on a secondary carbon tend to have values in the **0.2–0.5 range**, and the extra carbon in **CCCCC(C)O** slightly increases it compared to `CCC(C)CCO` (0.2440).

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.849394895272866
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl/Br)**:
   - Molecules with chlorine substituents often have negative property values, especially when multiple Cl atoms are present (e.g., ClCCl: -0.926, ClC(Cl)Cl: -0.563). However, the effect diminishes with aromatic systems (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.368).
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but similarly bulky. Its effect may be slightly less negative than Cl.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with no polar substituents (e.g., c1ccccc1) are not in the examples, but substituted aromatics with halogens tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.368).
   - The presence of two halogens in para positions (1,4-disubstitution) seems to reduce the magnitude of the negative property compared to single substitutions or ortho/meta substitutions.

3. **Bromine-Specific Examples**:
   - There is one bromine-containing example: **CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O** with a value of **1.5489969**, but this is a complex structure with other functional groups (amide, ketone), so it’s not directly comparable.
   - For **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene), the value is **-0.368**. Bromine is less electronegative, so the property might be slightly less negative.

4. **Other Trends**:
   - Non-halogenated aliphatic chains or polar groups (e.g., C=O, OH) can push the property positive, but this molecule lacks those.

### Prediction:
For **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- It is structurally analogous to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene), which has a value of **-0.368**.
- Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine, so the electron-withdrawing effect is weaker. This would likely make the property slightly less negative than the chloro analog.
- However, bromine is larger and more polarizable, which could introduce some additional dispersion effects, but this is hard to quantify without more data.

Given the lack of direct bromine examples, I will estimate the value to be **less negative** than the chloro analog but still in the same general range. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.30**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.11309652319188
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **ClC(Br)Br** (small, non-aromatic chlorinated molecule): -0.56346424
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure): 0.82938933
   - The given molecule is also a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure, similar to the second example but with slightly fewer chlorines (6 Cl atoms instead of 10 in the example).

2. **Effect of Chlorination**:
   - Increasing chlorination on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value (compare the first two examples). 
   - The given molecule has fewer chlorines than the second example (6 vs. 10), so its property value should be lower than 0.82938933 but higher than small chlorinated aliphatics like ClC(Br)Br (-0.56346424).

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The given molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl with conjugation and symmetry, which likely contributes positively to the property value.

4. **Comparison to Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic systems with fewer chlorines (e.g., **c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)**): -0.11879128
   - The given molecule has more chlorines, so its value should be higher.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** should be between **0.5 and 0.8**, closer to the highly chlorinated biphenyl example (0.82938933) but slightly lower due to fewer chlorines. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.65** (specific value interpolated based on the examples). 

However, looking at the exact pattern, the molecule is very similar to the second example but with fewer chlorines, so a slight reduction from 0.82938933 is appropriate. A precise prediction would be:  
**0.72** (reflecting the reduced chlorination but similar structure). 

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is:  
**0.72** (specific property value). 

### Final Answer:
**0.72**

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.8277262946457763
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, polarity, and presence of heteroatoms (e.g., halogens, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur). The property values range from negative to positive, with some highly positive outliers (e.g., 10.7748461 for **CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C**, likely due to multiple ester groups, and 6.79854319 for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC**, likely due to the phosphorus and sulfur content).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

This molecule has the following features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three benzene rings (two substituted with methyl groups).
2. **Phosphate group (P=O)**: Central phosphorus with two aromatic ether linkages (O-aryl) and one hydroxyl (OH). This is a polar and charged (at physiological pH) functional group.
3. **Methyl substituents**: Three methyl groups (electron-donating, hydrophobic).
4. **High molecular weight and rigidity**: The structure is bulky due to the three aromatic rings and phosphate linker.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with phosphate/phosphorothioate groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC**, **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**) tend to have moderately negative to highly positive property values, depending on additional functional groups.
- Aromatic-rich molecules with polar groups (e.g., **Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1**, **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) often have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and a polar phosphate group suggests a moderately negative property value, similar to other complex aromatic-polar hybrids.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to molecules like **Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1** (-0.89536973) and **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (-0.1842169), but with the added phosphate group (which may increase polarity and bulkiness), the predicted property value is likely in the moderately negative range. 

**Predicted property value: -0.75**  
*(This is an estimate based on the examples, likely between -0.5 and -1.0 due to the phosphate group's contribution.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.5788014830634552
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the molecule. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`) tend to have higher property values (1.72816899 in this case). CF3 is electron-withdrawing and often increases the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached. Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2 in `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O`) have high values (2.98577294), but this is extreme. Simpler cases like `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` have 0.99023874.
3. **Chlorine atoms**: The molecule has two Cl atoms attached to a heterocycle. Chlorine tends to moderately increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has 0.99023874, `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has 0.8493949).
4. **Ketone (C=O)**: The heterocycle has a ketone group, which is polar and may increase the value slightly.
5. **Heterocycle (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar, and strained structure. Similar complex heterocycles (e.g., `O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13`) have negative values (-0.81080736), but this one is more polar and chlorinated.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (0.99023874) but with a CF3 instead of NO2 and a more complex heterocycle. CF3 is less electron-withdrawing than NO2, but the heterocycle adds complexity.
- The presence of CF3 and Cl suggests a value in the range of 0.5 to 1.5, but the heterocycle may reduce it slightly due to steric/electronic effects.

### Predicted Value:
Considering all factors, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.85** (slightly lower than `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` due to the heterocycle but higher than simpler chlorinated aromatics). 

### Final Answer:
**0.85**

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2003088276539617
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Present in molecules like `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 1.34489065) and `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` (property = 0.17564764). Methoxy groups often contribute positively to the property (values > 0).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2, represented as N(=O)=O)**: Present in molecules like `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.75627357) and `c1ccccc1O` (property = 0.80992282). Nitro groups also tend to increase the property value.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule has a benzene ring substituted with methoxy and nitro groups. Aromatic rings with polar substituents (like -NO2 or -OCH3) often have property values in the range of 0.5 to 1.5, as seen in similar examples.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups): 0.75627357.
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): 0.80992282.
   - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (dimethyl phthalate): 1.34489065.
   - The presence of both methoxy and nitro groups suggests a value between 0.7 and 1.3.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of the methoxy and nitro groups on the aromatic ring, the property value is likely in the higher end of the range observed for similar molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (approximate, likely between 0.8 and 1.0). 

This aligns with the trend where nitro and methoxy substituents on aromatic rings yield values in this range.

True Property: -0.6164718123620212
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule is a polycyclic alkane with **8 chlorine atoms** attached. From the examples, highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) molecules tend to have elevated property values:
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane) has a value of **0.07816238**.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorophenol) has a very high value of **3.20726863** due to combined Cl and OH groups.
   - **ClCCCl** (dichloroethane) has a low value of **-0.80420303**, but this is a simple aliphatic dichloride.

2. **Steric and Electronic Effects**: The given molecule is a **caged polycyclic chlorocarbon** (similar to a chlorinated adamantane or cubane derivative). Such rigid, highly substituted structures often exhibit unique electronic properties due to strain and Cl electronegativity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**, but our molecule has **more Cl atoms and a more constrained 3D structure**, likely increasing the property value further.
   - The presence of **Cl on quaternary carbons** (e.g., C3(Cl)) and **double-bonded Cl (C(=C(Cl)...)** suggests even stronger contributions.

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and polycyclic rigidity, the property value should be **higher than hexachlorocyclohexane (0.078)** but lower than pentachlorophenol (3.207), as the latter has an additional polar OH group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.85**  

This accounts for the additive effects of 8 Cl atoms and the strained polycyclic framework, placing it in the upper mid-range of the examples.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.3810828181882704
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Functional Groups**:
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): -0.769 (nonpolar, aliphatic)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.449 (alkyne, slightly polar)
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.397 (nitrile, polar but small)
   - **CCCI** (iodoethane): -0.804 (polar, heavy halogen)
   - **CC(Cl)Cl** (dichloroethane): -0.563 (polar, halogens)
   - **CC(Cl)CCl** (1,2-dichloropropane): -0.312 (similar but less negative than dichloroethane).

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): 0.064 (ester + aromatic amine)
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: -0.897 (complex ester with ether/aromatic)
   - **CC(=O)OCCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: -0.788 (ester + amide + aromatic).

3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: -0.897 (ester + ether)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol): 10.618 (polyol, very high value)
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenylethanol): 0.285 (alcohol + aromatic).

4. **Small Polar Molecules**:
   - **NC(=O)N** (urea): 0.175 (polar, hydrogen bonding)
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (benzamide): 0.673 (amide + aromatic).

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (Propyl Formate):
- **Structure**: Aliphatic ester (propyl group + formate group).
- **Key Features**:
  - Ester group (**C=O** and **O** linkage) introduces polarity.
  - Short aliphatic chain (propyl) reduces hydrophobicity compared to pure hydrocarbons.
  - No aromaticity or heavy halogens.
- **Comparable Examples**:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: 0.064 (ester + aromatic, slightly positive).
  - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: -0.897 (ester + complex polar groups, very negative).
  - **CC(=O)OCCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: -0.788 (ester + amide, negative).

Given that **CCCOC=O** is a simple ester without additional polar or aromatic features, its property value is likely modestly negative, similar to other small esters but less extreme than complex examples. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.45**, reflecting its intermediate polarity and lack of strong additional functional groups. 

**Final Answer: -0.45**

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.7864730396889261
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity vs. Polarity**: 
   - Long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with property **-0.69779531**) tend to have negative values, indicating hydrophobic character.
   - Polar or functionalized groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)CO** with property **2.06995945**) tend to have positive values, indicating hydrophilic character.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** with **2.11482984**) often have higher positive values due to polarity.
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** with **2.01093953**) increase the property value due to electronegativity.

3. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - Molecules with both hydrophobic (alkyl) and polar (ester) groups, like **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (property **1.54262791**), show intermediate values.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long-chain alkyl ester** (decanoyl ethyl ester):
  - **Long hydrocarbon chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: Contributes hydrophobicity (negative effect on property value).
  - **Ester group (C(=O)OCC)**: Contributes polarity (positive effect on property value).

Given the dominance of the long hydrophobic chain (10 carbons) and the single polar ester group, the property value is likely **positive but modest**, similar to **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (property **1.54262791**), but slightly lower due to the longer alkyl chain.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.25** (estimated based on structural analogy). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend that esters with long alkyl chains balance hydrophobicity and polarity.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6082952751973937
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...):** Present in many examples, often associated with negative values (e.g., `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` = 0.236, `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` = -0.574).
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl):** Common in the dataset, with mixed effects. Multiple Cl atoms can increase hydrophobicity or polarity, but context matters (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` = 0.990, `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 11.426).
3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O):** Strongly electron-withdrawing. In `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, it correlates with a high value (0.990). Here, it’s attached to an aromatic ring.
4. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N):** Often reduces the property value (e.g., `NC(=O)c1ccccc1` = 0.673, but other amides like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1` = -0.317).
5. **Extended conjugation:** The molecule has two aromatic rings linked by an amide, which may stabilize the system and lower the value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (0.990) has a nitro group and Cl, but no amide or phenol. The nitro group dominates, giving a high value.
- **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (-0.574) has phenol and Cl but no nitro or amide, yielding a negative value.
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (0.673) has an amide and aromatic ring but no nitro or Cl.

### Prediction:
The presence of the **nitro group** is likely to increase the property value, but the **amide** and **phenol** may counteract this. The molecule is more complex than most examples, but balancing these effects suggests a **moderate positive value**.

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This balances the nitro group's positive contribution (~0.9) with the amide/phenol's negative effects (~-0.5). The exact value would depend on nonlinear interactions, but 0.45 aligns with the dataset trends.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.7865062736028319
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Polarity and functional groups**: Molecules with highly polar or electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, O, N, S) tend to have higher absolute property values, especially if they are present in large numbers or in conjugated systems.
2. **Aromaticity**: Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) often contribute positively to the property, especially when substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO₂).
3. **Size and branching**: Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., polycyclic or heavily substituted) can have higher or lower values depending on the balance of polar/nonpolar regions.
4. **Phosphorus and sulfur**: The presence of P(=S) or S (thioether/sulfoxide) groups seems to introduce variability, sometimes lowering the property (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N... has 0.26965954, while CCSSCC has -0.54881257).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

1. **Structure**:
   - Two **P(=S)(OC)OC** groups (phosphorodithioate esters, highly polar).
   - Two aromatic rings linked by a **thioether (S)** bridge.
   - Multiple oxygen atoms (ether and phosphate linkages).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule is large and symmetrical, with repeating P(=S) and aromatic units.
   - The **P(=S)** groups are strongly polar and likely dominate the property.
   - The **thioether (S)** bridge and aromatic rings add to the complexity but may not outweigh the P(=S) contribution.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **0.26965954** (similar P(=S) group but fewer aromatic rings and a Cl substituent).
   - **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has **0.23338368** (highly chlorinated aromatics, but no P(=S)).
   - The target molecule has **two P(=S) groups** and **two aromatic systems**, which would likely increase the property compared to the above examples but not as drastically as highly chlorinated cases (e.g., ClC(F)(F)C(F)(F)Cl at 11.426).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar P(=S) groups and aromaticity, the value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where P(=S) and aromatic systems contribute additively but not explosively (unlike perhalogenated aliphatics). The symmetry and lack of extreme electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂) prevent it from reaching higher values.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.990238741727685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule is a nitrophenol derivative (phenol with a nitro group). 
   - Example: **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has a property value of **1.34078714**. This is an amide-substituted phenol, but the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is more electron-withdrawing than the amide, which may influence the property differently.
   - Another example: **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (toluene with a nitro group) has a property value of **1.34078714**. This suggests nitroaromatics with simple substituents tend to have values around **1.34**.

2. **Phenol derivatives**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (trichlorophenol) has a high value of **2.01093953**, likely due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of multiple chlorines.
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** (dimethylphenol) has a value of **1.39958057**, indicating hydroxyl + alkyl groups increase the property.

3. **Nitro group impact**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, and in **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, it is para to the hydroxyl group. This intramolecular interaction (hydrogen bonding or resonance) may slightly lower the property compared to **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**.

4. **Other nitroaromatics**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a value of **-0.66331771**, but this is a more complex, disubstituted system with additional electronegative atoms.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** and its similarity to **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (value = 1.34078714), but with a hydroxyl group instead of a methyl, we expect a slightly higher value due to the additional polar hydroxyl group. However, the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing effect may dominate, keeping it close to **1.34**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**1.34078714** (same as the nitro-toluene example, as the hydroxyl and nitro effects may balance out similarly). 

If we account for the hydroxyl's slight increase, it could be marginally higher, but given the data, **1.34078714** is the most consistent prediction.

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **1.34078714**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.9111433834932643
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is a highly oxygenated carbohydrate (a polysaccharide derivative, likely a oligosaccharide or glycoside), with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (C-O-C). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, carbonyls) tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has 0.760, `COc1ccccc1O` has 0.758).
- Highly halogenated molecules (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N`) or those with unusual bonding (e.g., `NC(N)=NC#N`) can have very high values.
- Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have low positive values, while polar but less complex molecules (e.g., `CCC#N`) have negative values.

The given molecule:
- Has **12 hydroxyl groups**, **5 ether linkages**, and a branched structure, making it very polar and complex.
- Similar to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = -0.344), but much larger and more oxygenated.

Given the trend, the property value for this molecule is likely **negative but closer to zero** due to the high polarity and size. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.28**  

This balances the negative contribution of polar groups (as seen in smaller polyols) with the size/complexity (which might slightly offset the negativity).
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.44882276337961785
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a diyne with aromatic rings), which has a high property value of **2.02565397**. This suggests that triple bonds (C#C) may contribute to higher property values, especially when conjugated or in a rigid structure.

2. **Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone with an alkyl chain) has a value of **0.24261119**.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (an aldehyde with a longer alkyl chain) has a value of **-0.28392149**.
   - Simple hydrocarbons like **CCCC(O)CCC** (an alcohol) have moderate values (~0.48), while purely aliphatic chains like **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** have lower values (~0.235).

3. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O) tend to reduce the property value unless conjugated with unsaturated systems.
   - Unsaturation (double/triple bonds) increases the property value, especially in rigid or conjugated systems.

### Analysis of **CCC#C**:
- This is a simple terminal alkyne (1-butyne) with no conjugation or additional functional groups. 
- Compared to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**, it lacks aromaticity or extended conjugation, so its property value should be lower.
- Compared to alkanes/alkenes, the triple bond should still elevate the value somewhat.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends:
- The terminal alkyne is less conjugated than **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**, so its value should be lower than 2.025.
- It is more unsaturated than simple alkanes/alkenes, so its value should be higher than typical alkyl chains (~0.2–0.5).

A reasonable estimate is **~1.2 to 1.5**. 

However, looking at simpler unsaturated molecules:
- **Cc1cncc(C)c1** (a methyl-substituted pyridine-like structure) has a value of **1.02070765**.
- **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (a branched ketone) has a surprisingly high value of **2.38816575**, but this may be an outlier.

Given that **CCC#C** is a simple alkyne, a conservative prediction would be slightly higher than typical alkenes/alkanes but not as high as conjugated systems. 

**Final predicted property value: 1.3** (approximate, likely between 1.0 and 1.5). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value could vary if the property is highly sensitive to specific features like bond topology or electronic effects.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.7988392280197981
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group, often associated with intermediate property values (e.g., see `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with a value of **0.26965954**).
2. **Aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents**: Highly halogenated aromatic rings tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **0.06429327**, while `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` has **1.81532036**). The presence of multiple chlorines can increase or decrease the value depending on substitution pattern.
3. **Ethoxy and ethyl groups (CCO and CC)**: These are non-polar and may slightly lower the property value (e.g., `CCCCOCCCC` has **-0.2284863**).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The phosphorothioate group is present in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (value = **0.26965954**), which also has a chloroaromatic ring and polar groups.
- The heavily chlorinated aromatic ring in `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **0.06429327**, while `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` has **1.81532036**. The substitution pattern here is closer to the former (meta/para chlorines).

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely in the low-to-mid positive range, similar to other phosphorothioate-containing or moderately chlorinated molecules in the dataset.

**Predicted property value: 0.18** (approximate, based on structural analogs).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the given data.)*

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.296610951585034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - **C(=O)NN**: This is a carbohydrazide group, which is strongly polar and likely to increase the property value (similar to other polar/ionic groups in the examples).
   - The nitrogen in the pyridine ring also contributes to polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar/ionic groups (e.g., NO₂, SO₃, CONH, etc.)** tend to have higher property values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1: 0.124**, **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2: 0.820**, **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: 0.747**).
   - The hydrazide group here is even more polar than simple amides or nitro groups, suggesting a higher value.
   - Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1Cl: 1.259**) also show higher values.

4. **Steric/Electronic Effects**:
   - The pyridine ring is electron-deficient, but the hydrazide group is electron-donating, creating a push-pull effect that may further increase polarity.

### Predicted Value:
Given the strong polarity of the hydrazide group and the aromatic pyridine ring, the property value is likely in the **higher range** of the examples, similar to other polar nitrogen-containing compounds. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This is based on:
- Similarity to **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (0.820)** (another polar heterocycle with H-bonding).
- The additional polarity of the hydrazide group pushing the value slightly higher.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that polar/ionic groups increase the numerical value in the given examples.)

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.36485517697145214
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (property = 0.70019507). This group often contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Thioester linkage (SCC(=O))**: The presence of sulfur and carbonyl groups can influence the property, though this exact motif isn't directly represented in the examples.
3. **Aliphatic chains (CCCO, OCCC, CC(=O)N1CCCCC1C)**: These are common in many examples, and their contributions are typically modest or negative (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)CC** has a value of 0.60936743, while **CCCCCCCI** has -0.32514804).
4. **Lactam-like ring (N1CCCCC1C)**: Cyclic amides/amines appear in some examples (e.g., **Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O** with 0.02784996), but their contributions vary.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (property = 0.70019507), which shares the **P(=S)** group and aromatic substitution. However, our molecule lacks aromaticity and has additional aliphatic complexity.
- **CCCCCOC(=O)CC** (0.60936743) is another reference for aliphatic chains with ester groups, but our molecule has more polar and bulky features (P(=S), thioester, and cyclic amine).

### Expected property:
Given the **P(=S)** group's positive contribution and the balancing effect of the aliphatic/cyclic components, the property is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** but slightly lower due to reduced aromaticity and increased flexibility.

### Predicted value:
**0.45** (approximate, based on structural analogies and trends in the examples). 

*Note: Without a clear regression model or more explicit rules, this is an educated estimate. The actual value could vary slightly depending on finer structural nuances.*

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.3251480413985475
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values for different molecular structures. The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a straight-chain alkane.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Property Values**:
   - **CC(Cl)Cl** (dichloropropane): -0.56346424
   - **CC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol): -0.1761233
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol): -0.32514804
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -0.06569323
   - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexyl-substituted alkane): -0.83330787

   Alkanes and simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of -0.3 to -0.8, with longer chains or cyclic structures pushing the value more negative.

2. **Octane (CCCCCCCC)**:
   - This is a longer, purely aliphatic hydrocarbon with no functional groups or branching. 
   - Comparing to **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol, -0.325) and **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexyl-substituted alkane, -0.833), octane is likely to have a more negative value than heptanol but less negative than the cyclic structure due to its linearity and lack of polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCC** (octane) is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-0.55** (similar to dichloropropane but slightly less negative due to lack of polar Cl groups). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.55** (approximate predicted property value for CCCCCCCC).

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -0.9075245305406962
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular features such as ring systems, functional groups (e.g., carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, halogens, nitro groups), and overall molecular complexity. The property values range from negative (e.g., for simpler alkanes or less polar molecules) to positive (e.g., for molecules with polar or reactive functional groups like nitro groups or halogens).

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

1. **Structural features**:  
   - Multiple fused rings (steroid-like structure).  
   - A carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - Two hydroxyl groups (OH).  
   - A terminal alkyne (C#C).  

2. **Comparison to examples**:  
   - Molecules with fused rings and carbonyl/hydroxyl groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of `-0.90891618`).  
   - The presence of polar groups (OH, C=O) does not necessarily increase the property value significantly in these examples.  
   - The alkyne group is not directly represented in the examples, but it is a relatively non-polar feature.  

3. **Closest analogs**:  
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a value of `-0.91154285`.  
   - `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of `-0.90891618`.  

The target molecule is very similar to these, with additional hydroxyl and alkyne groups. The alkyne may slightly increase the property value (less negative), while the extra hydroxyl could have a minor effect.  

**Predicted property value**:  
Given the strong similarity to the examples above, the predicted value is likely close to `-0.90`. A reasonable estimate is:  

**-0.89**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

True Property: -0.986484077030464
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, predicting the exact property value requires careful analysis of structural features and their correlation with the given property values. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Key Structural Observations**:
   - The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy -OCH3, hydroxyl -OH, ether -O-, and carbonyl C=O).
   - It has a polycyclic structure with fused rings and sugar-like moieties (evident from the OC3COC patterns).
   - There are no strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro -NO2 or sulfonyl -SO2) or heavy halogens (Br, I).

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple oxygen functionalities (e.g., COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br: 22.256) tend to have higher values, but this is skewed by the presence of P=O and halogens.
   - Aromatic systems with oxygen substituents (e.g., Oc1ccccc1Cl: 1.259) have moderate positive values.
   - Polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54: -0.569) tend to have negative values, but oxygen substitution can counteract this.

3. **Property Trends**:
   - The presence of multiple oxygen atoms (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors) and lack of strong electron-withdrawing groups suggests a moderate positive value.
   - The polycyclic nature and size of the molecule would typically reduce the value, but the oxygen functionalities balance this out.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the balance of oxygenated groups (increasing value) and polycyclic structure (decreasing value), the property value is likely in the low-to-moderate positive range.
   - Closest analogs in the examples are molecules like Oc1ccccc1Cl (1.259) or COc1ccccc1Cl (0.757), but adjusted for additional complexity.

**Final Predicted Property Value**: **0.48**  
*(This estimate balances the oxygen content against the polycyclic framework, likely falling between 0.4 and 0.6 based on the examples)*.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 1.2596853676952378
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values for similar structures. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: 
   - The molecule is a substituted phenol with a chlorine atom at the 4-position. 
   - Similar molecules in the dataset include:
     - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property: 1.34078714) – a phenol with a nitro group.
     - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: 0.99023874) – a phenol with a nitro group at a different position.
     - **Fc1ccccc1** (property: 0.80992282) – fluorobenzene.
     - **Clc1ccccc1I** (property: 1.25968537) – chlorobenzene with an iodine substituent.
     - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (property: -0.20644544) – a biphenyl with chlorine substituents.

2. **Trends**:
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, halogens) tend to have positive property values, often in the range of ~0.8 to ~1.3.
   - The presence of chlorine (moderately electron-withdrawing) is likely to give a value similar to or slightly lower than the nitro-substituted phenols.
   - Comparing **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (1.34078714) and **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (0.99023874), the position of substitution matters, with para-substitution (as in **Oc1ccccc1Cl**) likely yielding a higher value than meta-substitution.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** should be slightly lower than **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (1.34078714) but higher than **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (0.99023874), likely around **1.1 to 1.25**.
   - A reasonable estimate is **1.15**, but looking at **Clc1ccccc1I** (1.25968537), which has a similar halogen substitution pattern, we might predict a value close to this.

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximating to the trend seen in similar halogenated aromatics).

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Present in many examples, often associated with negative property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` has `0.2337108`, but others with more Cl substitutions or polar groups trend negative).
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (`-0.0934852`) and `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (`-0.57880148`), typically lowering the property value.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in examples, but triple bonds may slightly decrease hydrophilicity (no direct example, but similar to alkenes/alkanes).
   - **Ether (O)**: Present in `COc1ncnc2nccnc12` (`0.14658403`), but here combined with other polar groups.
   - **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Multiple Cl atoms often correlate with negative values (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` has `0.07816238`, but other Cl-heavy molecules are more negative).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar (due to Cl, amide, ether) but not as large as some highly negative examples (e.g., steroids with `~-0.9`). It lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups like CF3 or multiple carbonyls.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (`-0.57880148`): Has amide, Cl, and aromatic ring.
   - `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (`-0.16128806`): Ether + amide + aromatic.
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (`0.23679145`): Cl + aromatic, but no polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of **amide + Cl-substituted aromatic + ether**, the property value is likely **negative but not extreme** (between `-0.2` and `-0.6`). The alkyne may slightly offset polarity. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.6075835312844216
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a heterocyclic aromatic system with nitrogen atoms),
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of **two aromatic rings** (both with Cl substituents).
   - A **heterocyclic aromatic ring (c2cncnc2)** with nitrogen atoms, which may increase polarity or hydrogen-bonding potential.
   - A **hydroxyl group (OH)**, which can contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity.
   - **Chlorine substituents** on both phenyl rings, which often increase hydrophobicity and may influence electronic properties.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **chlorinated aromatic rings** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) tend to have property values around **1.0 to -0.4**, depending on other substituents.
- The presence of **heterocyclic nitrogen atoms** (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1`, `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) often leads to values in the range of **0.2 to 1.5**.
- The **hydroxyl group** (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`) is associated with values around **0.8-0.9** when combined with aromatic systems.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The combination of **two chlorinated phenyl rings** and a **heterocyclic nitrogen system** suggests moderate polarity but significant steric and electronic effects.
- The **hydroxyl group** adds some polarity, but the bulky aromatic systems may counteract this.
- The closest analogs in the examples are molecules like `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (-0.399) and `N(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C` (-0.754), which have bulky aromatic systems and heteroatoms.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (OH, heterocycle) and nonpolar (chlorinated aromatics) features, the property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to bulky aromatic systems with heteroatoms. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.65**  

This aligns with the trends observed for molecules with:
- Chlorinated aromatic rings (contributing slightly negative values).
- Heterocyclic nitrogen systems (contributing modest polarity).
- Bulky substituents (reducing the absolute value compared to simpler polar molecules). 

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**-0.65**

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.28392149181994053
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular structure and functional groups.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains tend to have lower (more negative) property values (e.g., `CCCCBr` = -0.674, `CCCCCC=O` = -0.284).
   - Branching can further reduce the value (e.g., `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1` = -0.123).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) = 0.934 (relatively high).
     - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...` (complex ester) = -0.876 (likely due to size/other groups).
   - **Aldehydes (RCHO)**:
     - `CCCCCC=O` (heptanal) = -0.284.
   - **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
     - Nitro groups significantly increase the value (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = 0.190, `CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` = 6.278).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
     - Bromine tends to increase the value (e.g., `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br` = 2.011).
     - Chlorine has mixed effects depending on context.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromaticity alone does not drastically change the value, but substituents do (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1` derivatives vary widely).

4. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
   - Ethers (`COC`) and alcohols tend to have moderate values unless paired with other polar groups.

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate):
- It is an ester (`RCOOR'`) with a short carbon chain (butyl group) and a formyl group (`HCO`).
- Compared to `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate, value = 0.934), butyl formate has:
  - A shorter acyl group (`HCO` instead of `C3H7CO`).
  - A slightly longer alcohol-derived chain (`C4H9` instead of `C2H5`).
- The formyl group (`HCO`) is more polar than a longer acyl group, which may slightly increase the value.
- However, the butyl chain is longer than ethyl, which may offset this.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Esters with short-to-medium chains have values around **0.5 to 1.0**.
- The simplicity of butyl formate suggests a value closer to the lower end of this range.
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: 0.75** (approximate, based on structural trends).

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.9263596343631936
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl)**:
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a very high value of 3.207).
   - However, simple chlorinated alkanes like `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane) have a property value of -0.804.

2. **Simple Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane): -0.804
   - `CCBr` (bromoethane): -0.926 (similar to `CNN`: -0.926, suggesting small halogenated or simple polar molecules may have values around -0.8 to -0.9).

3. **Size and Symmetry**:
   - `ClCCl` is smaller and more symmetric than `ClCCCl`, but the presence of two chlorines likely places it in a similar range as `ClCCCl`.

4. **Comparison to Other Small Molecules**:
   - `CCCC` (butane): -0.804 (same as `ClCCCl`), suggesting that small alkanes and simple chlorinated alkanes may share similar property values in this dataset.

### Prediction:
Given that `ClCCCl` has a value of -0.804 and `CCCC` (butane) also has -0.804, it is reasonable to predict that `ClCCl` (dichloromethane), being a similarly small and chlorinated molecule, would have a property value close to these. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:

**-0.80420303** (same as `ClCCCl` and `CCCC` in the dataset). 

This aligns with the trend that small, symmetric, and halogenated molecules (especially with Cl or Br) tend to cluster around this value unless additional functional groups or complexity are present.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 1.8153203574899421
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives (Aromatic Rings with -OH Group):**
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = **1.02070765**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol): Property = **1.0811255**
   - Phenolic structures with electron-donating groups (e.g., -CH3) tend to have positive property values (~1.0 or higher).

2. **Methyl-Substituted Phenol:**
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethyl-substituted phenol (2,5-dimethylphenol). 
   - It is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**, which has a property value of **1.0811255**. 

3. **Other Substituent Effects:**
   - Halogens or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, -CF3) tend to lower the property value.
   - Simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., -CH3) tend to increase the property value slightly compared to unsubstituted phenol.

### Prediction:
Given that **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol with two methyl groups (electron-donating), its property value should be close to or slightly higher than the monomethylphenol example (**1.0811255**). 

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**1.10** (approximated based on the trend of increasing property with additional methyl groups). 

(Note: If the exact value is required from the examples, the closest match is **1.0811255**, but the additional methyl group may slightly increase it further.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.18286148589435405
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the given molecule, I will predict the property value for:

**Molecule:**  
`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Chlorinated Biphenyl Core**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings connected (biphenyl) with multiple chlorine substituents. This is similar to some of the provided examples with polychlorinated aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`, which has a property value of `0.15673277`).
2. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**: The chlorine atoms are symmetrically distributed on both rings, which may influence the property similarly to other symmetrical polychlorinated aromatics.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = `0.15673277`): This is a hexachlorinated biphenyl with a similar substitution pattern but slightly more chlorines. The property is positive but modest.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = `0.21574449`): This is another polychlorinated biphenyl with a very similar structure (tetrachlorinated biphenyl), and its property is slightly higher (`0.21574449`).
   - `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br` (property = `2.01093953`): This is a heavily brominated benzene, and its property is much higher, but bromine substitution tends to increase the property more than chlorine.

### Prediction:
The given molecule is a tetrachlorinated biphenyl with a symmetrical substitution pattern. Comparing it to the most similar example (`Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, property = `0.21574449`), the property value should be in a similar range. The slightly fewer chlorines might reduce the value slightly, but the symmetry could offset this. 

**Predicted Property Value:**  
`0.18` (approximate, likely between `0.15` and `0.22` based on the examples). 

For specificity, I would predict:  
**`0.185`** (close to the `0.156` and `0.215` examples, interpolating based on substitution). 

### Final Answer:
`0.185`
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 1.2967313980284743
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): -0.32514804
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon): 2.00072956
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): -0.03765268
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isobutylene), similar to the above but smaller.

2. **Effect of Double Bonds**:
   - The presence of a double bond in **CCCCCCCCC=C** gives a slightly higher value (-0.03765268) compared to **CCCCCCCC** (-0.32514804), suggesting that unsaturation may increase the property value slightly.

3. **Branched vs. Linear**:
   - Branched hydrocarbons like **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** have significantly higher values (2.00072956) compared to linear chains, likely due to increased steric effects or molecular compactness.

4. **Smaller Branched Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a smaller branched alkene. Given that branching increases the value and a double bond also tends to increase it slightly, I would expect a value higher than linear alkanes but lower than larger branched alkanes.

### Prediction:
- **CC=C(C)C** has both branching and a double bond. Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCCCCC=C**: -0.03765268 (linear alkene)
  - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: 2.00072956 (branched alkane)
  - The double bond and branching in **CC=C(C)C** should place it between these values, likely closer to the higher end due to the compact branching.

Given these trends, I predict the property value for **CC=C(C)C** to be approximately **1.5**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: 1.5**
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.9263596343631936
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary based on molecular structure, functional groups, and substituents. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) in the context of the provided data.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values when the chlorines are on aromatic rings (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of 1.4278277). 
   - Aliphatic chlorinated compounds like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) have a high value (5.42771034), but this is a highly chlorinated alkene.
   - `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a modest value (0.2305153), but this is a large aromatic system.

2. **Small Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - The simplest chlorinated alkane in the examples is `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (5.42771034), but this is not directly comparable to `ClCCl` (dichloromethane).
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has a negative value (-0.61647181), but this is not a simple alkane.

3. **General Trend**:
   - Small, non-aromatic chlorinated molecules with fewer chlorines (like `ClCCl`) are not explicitly represented in the examples, but we can infer that their property values are likely lower than heavily chlorinated or aromatic systems.
   - The presence of two chlorines in a small molecule like `ClCCl` suggests a moderate property value, likely in the range of 1-3 based on the examples.

### Prediction for `ClCCl`:
Given the lack of direct examples of simple dichlorinated alkanes, but considering that:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of 5.42771034,
- `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)` (hexachlorobenzene) has a value of 0.2305153,
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (dichlorophenol) has a value of 1.4278277,

a reasonable estimate for `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) would be **between 1.0 and 2.0**. 

A plausible predicted value is:  
**1.5** (interpolating between the simpler chlorinated examples). 

However, since `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` is much higher (5.4) and `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)` is lower (0.23), and `ClCCl` is simpler, a more conservative estimate might be closer to **1.0**. 

Given the uncertainty, I would predict:  
**1.2** (as a compromise between the higher and lower chlorinated examples). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for `ClCCl` is **1.2**.
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 2.3798961708822843
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Phenols**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is very similar to the target molecule but with slightly different chlorine positions) has a property value of **2.17923636**. 
   - The target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is also a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms, just like the example above, but with a different substitution pattern (1,2,4-trichlorophenol vs. the example's likely 2,4,6-trichlorophenol).

2. **Effect of Chlorine Substitution**:
   - Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value when attached to an aromatic ring, especially in electron-withdrawing positions. 
   - The example **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (a brominated benzene) has a value of **1.39958057**, which is lower than the chlorinated phenol example, suggesting that chlorinated phenols may have higher values than brominated benzenes.

3. **Phenol vs. Non-Phenol**:
   - The hydroxyl group (OH) on the phenol seems to contribute to higher property values when combined with halogens (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** at 2.179). 
   - Non-phenol chlorinated aromatics like **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** have lower values.

4. **Substitution Pattern**:
   - The example **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (likely 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of 2.179. 
   - The target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is 1,2,4-trichlorophenol. The substitution pattern is less symmetric, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to the 2,4,6-isomer due to less additive electron-withdrawing effects.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2.179) but with a less symmetric substitution pattern, the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is likely slightly lower but still in a similar range. 

**Predicted property value: 1.95** (approximate, considering the slightly less additive effect of the 1,2,4-substitution compared to 2,4,6). 

However, since the examples show that chlorinated phenols with three chlorines tend to have values around 2.179, and the substitution pattern here is not drastically different, another reasonable estimate would be close to the given example. 

Given the lack of additional data points for 1,2,4-trichlorophenol, the safest prediction is to assume it is very similar to the 2,4,6-isomer. 

**Final predicted value: 2.179** (same as the provided example, as the difference may be negligible based on the given data). 

But since the substitution pattern is slightly different, a more conservative estimate would be slightly lower, e.g., **2.0**. 

Given the options, the closest match is the example value of **2.179**, so:

**Predicted property value: 2.179** (same as the provided chlorinated phenol example). 

If forced to choose a slightly adjusted value due to the substitution pattern, **2.0** would be reasonable, but the data does not provide enough evidence for a significant deviation from the example. 

Thus, the most defensible answer is: **2.179**. 

However, since the exact substitution pattern differs, let's split the difference and say **2.0**. 

But given the examples, the best match is **2.179**. 

**Final answer: 2.179** (same as the provided example of a similar chlorinated phenol). 

(Note: Without more examples of chlorinated phenols with different substitution patterns, this is the most justifiable prediction.) 

**Predicted value: 2.179**. 

---

**Correction**: Upon closer inspection, the example **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** is likely 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (symmetric substitution), while the target **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is 1,2,4-trichlorophenol (less symmetric). The symmetric substitution in 2,4,6-trichlorophenol may lead to slightly higher additive effects, so the 1,2,4-isomer might be slightly lower. 

Thus, a more precise prediction would be slightly less than 2.179, e.g., **2.0**. 

But since the data does not provide enough examples to quantify this difference, the conservative answer is to stick with the closest example: **2.179**. 

**Final predicted value: 2.179**. 

(If you have additional examples of chlorinated phenols with different substitution patterns, the prediction could be refined further.) 

---

Given the lack of additional data, the prediction is: **2.179**. 

(Note: In practice, small differences in substitution patterns can affect properties, but the given examples do not provide enough resolution to predict this precisely. Thus, the closest match is used.) 

**Final answer: 2.179**. 

---

**Alternative Approach**: If we average the values of similar molecules: 
- Chlorinated phenol (2.179) and brominated benzene (1.399), the target (chlorinated phenol) is closer to 2.179. 
- No other examples are closer, so **2.179** is the best guess. 

**Final answer: 2.179**. 

---

**Conclusion**: The predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **2.179**.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.986484077030464
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.). The property appears to be a computed or experimental descriptor, possibly related to logP (lipophilicity), solubility, or another physicochemical parameter.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

#### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple ether linkages (OCH3, OCO)**: These are polar but not strongly hydrophilic (e.g., methoxy groups in the examples like `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` have modest negative values).
2. **Aromatic rings with oxygen substituents**: Similar to `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.746) but without nitro groups, likely less positive.
3. **Lactone (COC=O)**: Polar carbonyl, similar to esters or lactones in the examples (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` with property = -0.860).
4. **Sugar-like polyol regions (OC3C(O)C4O)**: Highly polar, similar to `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = -0.726).
5. **Fused ring systems**: Contributes to molecular rigidity but not strongly hydrophobic (no long aliphatic chains).

#### Comparison to examples:
- The molecule is most similar to highly oxygenated, polar structures like sugars or polyols, which tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., -0.726 to -0.897).
- The presence of methoxy groups and a lactone may slightly offset the polarity, but the overall trend is toward hydrophilicity.

#### Predicted property:
Given the dominance of polar groups and lack of strong hydrophobic features (e.g., long aliphatic chains, halogens), the property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other polyoxygenated molecules in the dataset.

**Predicted value: -0.85**

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.7585246247445423
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (`S` and `N`), similar to thiazole or imidazole derivatives. The presence of `C(=O)` (carbonyl) and `N` (amine) substituents suggests polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A thiomethyl group (`CS-`) attached to the ring, which is moderately hydrophobic.
   - A bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`), which is highly hydrophobic and sterically hindering.
   - A carbonyl (`C=O`) and an amine (`NH`) on the ring, introducing polarity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = -0.59104982)**:
  - Both have a heterocyclic ring with `N`, `C=O`, and a tert-butyl group.
  - The main difference is the replacement of `O` and `S` in the given example with `S` and `N` here, but the overall polarity and steric effects are comparable.
- **Other polar/hydrophobic examples**:
  - Molecules with `C=O` and `N` (e.g., `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`, property = 1.34078714) tend to have higher values if more polar.
  - Bulky hydrophobic groups (e.g., `C(C)(C)C`) reduce the property value (as seen in the example above).

### Prediction:
Given the balance between polarity (from `C=O` and `NH`) and hydrophobicity (from `S` and tert-butyl), the property value is likely **close to the similar example** with `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (-0.59104982). However, the additional `S` and `N` here may slightly increase the value.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.45**

==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05838980673666733
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, functional groups, and overall polarity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate)

Breaking it down:
1. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: From examples like `Nc1ccccc1` (0.80992282) and `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (0.39109505), the aromatic ring alone or with simple substituents tends to have positive property values unless strongly deactivated.
2. **Ester group (CCOC(=O)-)**: Esters are polar but not as strongly as acids or highly polar groups. Examples like `CCCC(=O)OCC` (0.95706498) and `CCCCC(=O)OC` (0.64556693) suggest esters contribute positively but moderately to the property value.
3. **Ethyl group (CCO-)**: Alkyl groups like ethyl are weakly electron-donating and hydrophobic, contributing slightly positively (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CO` has 2.5015281, though this is an extreme case with tert-butyl).

Combining these observations:
- The aromatic ring with an ester substituent is somewhat similar to `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (-0.06336204), but the latter has an additional carbonyl, making it more polar/negative.
- The ester in `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is less polar than a nitro or highly electron-withdrawing group (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has 1.34078714), so the value should be lower than this.
- The closest analog is likely `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (-0.69525356), but the ester here is less polar than two aromatic rings linked by oxygen.

Given these comparisons, the property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is predicted to be **~0.5**. 

However, looking more closely at `CCCC(=O)OCC` (0.95706498), which is a simpler ester, and considering the aromatic ring's slight reduction in polarity compared to aliphatic chains, a refined estimate would be **~0.7**.

**Final predicted property value: 0.70**.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.3251480413985475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, CBr, CCl)**:
   - **CI** has a property value of **-1.01980357**.
   - Other halogenated compounds (e.g., Cl-substituted aromatics) tend to have negative or low-positive values unless other functional groups dominate.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) often reduces the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

2. **Hydrocarbons (Alkanes, Alkenes, Aromatics)**:
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (a ketone) has a value of **0.93364429**.
   - **CC(=C)C(=C)C** (a diene) has a very high value of **4.22122973**, likely due to conjugation.
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a value of **-0.19428149**, suggesting unsaturation slightly reduces the value compared to alkanes.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (a substituted aromatic) has a value of **1.02070765**, indicating aromaticity may increase the value.

3. **Chain Length and Functional Groups**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**) tend to have slightly negative values (e.g., **-0.32514804** for octanol).
   - The presence of polar or electronegative groups (e.g., Br, Cl) further reduces the value.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a 7-carbon alkyl chain with a terminal bromine (**1-bromoheptane**).
- Compared to **CI** (-1.01980357), the longer alkyl chain in **CCCCCCCBr** will mitigate the negative effect of Br slightly, but the property value will still be negative due to the halogen.
- Compared to **CCCCCCC=C** (-0.19428149), replacing the double bond with Br will likely lower the value further (Br is more electronegative and polarizable than a double bond).
- Compared to **CCCCCCCO** (-0.32514804), Br is more electronegative than OH, so the value may be slightly more negative.

### Estimated Value:
Given these trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCBr** is:
**-0.45**

### Justification:
- The value is negative due to the presence of Br.
- It is less negative than **CI** (-1.019) because the longer alkyl chain offsets some of the halogen effect.
- It is more negative than **CCCCCCC=C** (-0.194) because Br is more polarizable/electronegative than a double bond.
- It is close to values like **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (-0.324) or **CCCCCCCO** (-0.325), but slightly lower due to Br's stronger effect than Cl or OH.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is:
**-0.45** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.0198035720078964
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol)**:

1. **Small, polar molecules with oxygen (e.g., OH groups)** tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
   - `CCCCOC=O` (butyraldehyde) has a value of **-0.28392149**.
   - `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O` (a sugar derivative) has a value of **0.00260814**.
   - `CC(C)CCO` (a branched alcohol) has a value of **0.06511279**.

2. **Methanol (CO)** is a very small, polar molecule with a single hydroxyl group. It lacks complex branching or aromaticity, which would push the value further negative or positive. 

3. Compared to `CCC` (propane, **-0.92635963**), methanol is more polar but less hydrophobic, so its value should be significantly higher (less negative) but not as high as larger polar molecules.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CO (methanol)** would be slightly negative but closer to zero, similar to other small polar molecules in the dataset. 

### Predicted property value for **CO**:  
**~ -0.25**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data, where small polar molecules like alcohols/aldehydes fall in the range of -0.3 to +0.1.)*
